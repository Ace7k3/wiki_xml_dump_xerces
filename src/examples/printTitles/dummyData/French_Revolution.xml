{{Refimprove|date=April 2015}}

A '''parlement''' ({{IPA-fr|paʁləmɑ̃|-|Parlement.ogg}}) was a [[Provinces of France|provincial]] [[appellate court]] in the France of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', i.e. before the French Revolution. In 1789, 13 parlements existed, the most important of which was by far the Parlement of Paris. While English word ''[[parliament]]'' derives from this French term, parlements were not legislative bodies. They consisted of a dozen or more appellate judges, or about 1,100 judges nationwide.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} They were the court of final appeal of the judicial system, and typically wielded much power over a wide range of subject matter, particularly taxation. Laws and edicts issued by the Crown were not official in their respective jurisdictions until the parlements gave their assent by publishing them. The members were aristocrats called [[Nobles of the Robe|nobles of the gown]] who had bought or inherited their offices, and were independent of the King.

From 1770 to 1774 the [[Lord Chancellor of France|Lord Chancellor]], [[René Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou|Maupeou]], tried to abolish the Parlement of Paris in order to strengthen the Crown; however, when King [[Louis XV]] died in 1774, the ''parlements'' were reinstated. The ''parlements'' spearheaded the aristocracy's resistance to the absolutism and centralization of the Crown, but they worked primarily for the benefit of their own class, the French nobility. [[Alfred Cobban]] argues that the ''parlements'' were the chief obstacles to any reform before the Revolution, as well as the most formidable enemies of the French Crown. He concludes that the &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Parlement of Paris, though no more in fact than a small, selfish, proud and venal oligarchy, regarded itself, and was regarded by public opinion, as the guardian of the constitutional liberties of France.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

{{Ancien Régime}}

==History==
The political institutions of the Parlement  in ''Ancien Régime'' France developed out of the King's Council (Fr. ''[[Conseil du roi]]'', Lat. ''[[curia regis]]''), and consequently enjoyed ancient, customary consultative and deliberative prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Prothero, &quot;The Parliament [''sic''] of Paris&quot;, ''The English Historical Review'', '''13''', No. 50 (April 1898), pp. 229-241.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, the parlements acquired judicial functions, then the {{lien|droit de remontrance|lang=fr|droit de remontrance}} against the king. The parlement judges were of the opinion that their role included active participation in the legislative process, which brought them into increasing conflict with the ever increasing monarchical [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] of the ''Ancien Régime'', as the ''[[lit de justice]]'' evolved during the 16th century from a constitutional forum to a royal weapon, used to force registration of edicts.&lt;ref&gt;Mack P. Holt, &quot;The King in Parliament: The Problem of the ''Lit de Justice'' in Sixteenth-Century France&quot; ''The Historical Journal'' (September 1988( 32#3  pp:507-523.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Rennes - Parlement de Bretagne.jpg|450px|thumb|Façade of the palace of Parlement of Brittany]]

Originally, since c. 1250, there was only the Parlement of Paris, severed from the King's Council in 1307, with sessions held inside the medieval [[Palace|royal palace]] on the [[Île de la Cité]], still the site of the [[Paris Hall of Justice]]. The Paris parlement's jurisdiction covered the entire kingdom as it was in the 14th century, but did not automatically advance in step with the Crown's ever expanding realm. In 1443, following the turmoil of the [[Hundred Years' War]], King [[Charles VII of France]] granted [[Languedoc]] its own parlement by establishing the Parlement of [[Toulouse]], the first parlement outside Paris; its jurisdiction extended over most of southern France.

===Fronde===
{{main article|Fronde}}
The Parlement of Paris played a major role in stimulating the nobility to resist the expansion of royal power by military force in the Fronde, 1643-1652.  In the end, the King won out and the nobility was humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lloyd Moote. ''The Revolt of the Judges: the Parlement of Paris and the Fronde, 1643-1652'' (Princeton University Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis XIV===
The parlements could withhold their assent by formulating remonstrances against the king's edicts, forcing the king to react, sometimes resulting in repeated resistance by the parlements, which the king could only terminate in his favour by issuing a ''Lettre de jussion'', and, in case of continued resistance, appearing in person in the parlement: the ''Lit de justice''. In such a case, the parlement's powers were be suspended for the duration of this royal session. [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] moved to centralize authority into his own hands, imposing certain restrictions on the parlements. In 1665, he ordained that a ''Lit de justice'' could be held without the king having to appear in person. In 1667, he limited the number of remonstrances to only one. In 1671–1673, however, the parlements resisted the taxes occasioned by [[Franco-Dutch War| the Dutch War]]. In 1673, the king imposed additional restrictions that stripped the parlements of any influence upon new laws by ordaining that remonstrances could only be issued after registration of the edicts. After Louis' death in 1715, all the restrictions were discontinued by the regent, although some of the judges of the Parlement of Paris accepted royal bribes to restrain that body until the 1750s.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Hurt, ''Louis XIV and the Parlements: The Assertion of Royal Authority'' (2002) p 195-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provinces==
From 1443 until the French Revolution, several other parlements were steadily created all over France, until at the end of the Ancien Régime there were provincial parlements in: (clockwise from the north) [[Douai]], [[Arras]], [[Metz]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Colmar]], [[Dijon]], [[Besançon]], [[Grenoble]], [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]], [[Perpignan]], [[Toulouse]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Rennes]], and [[Rouen]]. These locations were provincial capitals of those provinces with strong historical traditions of independence before they were annexed to France. Assembled in the parlements, the largely hereditary members, the provincial nobles of the gown were the strongest decentralizing force in a France that was more multifarious in its legal systems, taxation, and custom than it might have seemed under the apparent unifying rule of its kings. Nevertheless, the Parlement of Paris had the largest jurisdiction of all the parlements, covering the major part of northern and central France, and was simply known as &quot;the Parlement&quot;.

In some regions provincial States-General also continued to meet and legislate with a measure of self-governance and control over taxation within their jurisdiction.

All the parlements could issue regulatory decrees for the application of royal edicts or of customary practices; they could also refuse to register laws that they adjudged as either untimely or contrary to the local customary law (and there were 300 customary law jurisdictions). Tenure on the court was generally bought from the royal authority; and such positions could be made hereditary by payment of a tax to the King called ''la [[Paulette (tax)|Paulette]]''.

==Role leading to French Revolution==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:de Maniban de Cazaubon.jpg|thumb|220px|Joseph-Gaspard de Cazaubon, marquis de Maniban, First President of the ''Parlement'' of [[Toulouse]] in 1723 ([[Musée des Augustins]], Toulouse).]] --&gt;

After 1715, during the reigns of [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV of France]] and [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], the parlements repeatedly challenged the crown for control over policy, especially regarding taxes and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Dabiel Roche, ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1998) pp 462-82&lt;/ref&gt;  The Parlement had the duty to record all royal edicts and laws. Some, especially the Parlement of Paris, gradually acquired the habit of refusing to register legislation with which they disagreed until the king held a ''[[lit de justice]]'' or sent a ''[[Letters patent|lettre de jussion]]'' to force them to act. Furthermore, the parlements could pass ''arrêts de réglement'', which were laws that applied within their jurisdiction.  In the years immediately before the start of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, their extreme concern to preserve ''Ancien Régime'' institutions of noble privilege prevented France from carrying out many simple reforms, especially in the area of taxation, even when those reforms had the support of the king.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Swann]], ''Politics and the Parlement of Paris under Louis XV, 1754-1774'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou|Chancellor René Nicolas de Maupeou]] sought to reassert royal power by suppressing the parlements in 1770. A furious battle resulted and after King Louis XV died, the parlements were restored.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, &quot;The Parlements of France and the Breakdown of the Old Regime 1771-1788.&quot; ''French Historical Studies'' (1970): 415-458 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/285992 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the proposed radical changes began with the Protests of the Parlement of Paris addressed to Louis XVI in March 1776, in which the [[Estates General (France)|Second Estate]], the nobility, resisted the beginning of certain reforms that would remove their privileges, notably their exemption from taxes. The objections made to the Parlement of Paris were in reaction to the essay, ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses'' (&quot;Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth&quot;) by [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]]. The Second Estate reacted to the essay with anger to convince the king that the nobility still served a very important role and still deserved the same privileges of tax exemption as well as for the preservation of the guilds and corporations put in place to restrict trade, both of which were eliminated in the reforms proposed by Turgot.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle,  &quot;The Parlements of France and the Breakdown of the Old Regime 1771-1788.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In their Remonstrance against the Edict suppressing the Corvée (March 1776), the Parlement of Paris - afraid that a new tax would replace the Corvée, and that this tax would apply to all, introducing equality as a principle - dared to remind the king:
:The personal service of the clergy is to fulfill all the functions relating to education and religious observances and to contribute to the relief of the unfortunate through its alms. The noble dedicates his blood to the defense of the state and assists to sovereign with his counsel. The last class of the nation, which cannot render such distinguished service to the state, fulfills its obligation through taxes, industry, and physical labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John W. Boyer and Keith M. Baker, eds.|title=University of Chicago Readings in Western Civilization, Volume 7: The Old Regime and the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MB5zuyyQ4rMC&amp;pg=PA120|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=119–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Estate (the nobility) consisted of approximately 1.5% of France's population, and was exempt from almost all taxes, including the Corvée Royale, which was a recent mandatory service in which the roads would be repaired and built by those subject to the [[corvée]]. In practice, anyone who paid a small fee could escape the corvee, so this burden of labor fell only to the poorest in France. The Second Estate was also exempt from the [[Gabelle]], which was the unpopular tax on salt, and also the [[Taille]], the oldest form of taxation in France.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Pays d'État'', the taille was called ''réelle'', based on land ownership, and determined by a council; in the ''Pays d'Élection'' the taille was called ''personnelle'', based on the global capacity to pay, and assessed by the Intendant. In both cases, the tax was often considered arbitrary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Estate feared they would have to pay the tax replacing the suppressed Corvée. The nobles saw this tax as especially humiliating and below them, as they took great pride in their titles and their lineage, many of whom had died in defense of France. They saw this elimination of tax privilege as the gateway for more attacks on their rights and urged Louis XVI throughout the Protests of the Parlement of Paris not to enact the proposed reforms.

These exemptions, as well as the right to wear a sword and their coat of arms, encouraged the idea of a natural superiority over the commoners that was common through the Second Estate, and as long as any noble was in possession of a fiefdom, they could collect a tax on the Third Estate called Feudal Dues, which would allegedly be for the Third Estate's protection (this only applied to serfs and tenants of farmland owned by the nobility). Overall, the Second Estate had vast privileges that the Third Estate did not possess, which in effect protected the Second Estate's wealth and property, while hindering the Third Estate's ability to advance. The reforms proposed by Turgot and argued against in the Protests of the Parlement of Paris conflicted with the Second Estates’ interests to keep their hereditary privileges, and was the first step toward reform that seeped into the political arena. Turgot's reforms were unpopular among the commoners as well, who saw the parlements as their best defense against the power of the monarchy.

==Reaction==
This behavior of the parlements is one of the reasons that since the [[French Revolution]], French courts have been forbidden by Article 5 of the [[Napoleonic code|French civil code]] to create law and act as legislative bodies, their only mandate being to interpret the law.  France, through the Napoleonic Code, was at the origin of the modern system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in which precedents are not as powerful as in countries of [[common law]]. The origin of the separation of powers in the French court system, with no [[stare decisis|rule of precedent]] outside the interpretation of the law, no single supreme court and no constitutional review of statutes by courts until 1971 (by action, before the [[Constitutional Council of France]] created in 1958) and 2010 (by exception, before any court)&lt;ref&gt;The control of conventionality according to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was introduced in 1975 and 1989, respectively for judiciary and administrative courts.&lt;/ref&gt; is usually traced to that hostility towards &quot;government by judges&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Davis, ''The Law/Politics Distinction, the French Conseil Constitutionnel, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U. S. Supreme Court]]'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Winter, 1986), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/840292 pp. 45-92]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Beardsley, ''Constitutional Review in France'', The Supreme Court Review, Vol. 1975, (1975), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3108812 pp. 189-259]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denis Tallon, John N. Hazard, George A. Bermann, ''The Constitution and the Courts in France'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 27, No. 4 (Autumn, 1979), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/839794 pp. 567-587]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial proceedings==
In civil trials, judges had to be paid ''épices'' (literally &quot;spices&quot; – fees) by the parties. Civil justice was out of reach of most of the population, except the wealthiest and best connected.

Regarding criminal justice, the proceedings were markedly archaic.  Judges could order suspects to be [[torture]]d in order to extract confessions or induce them to reveal the names of their [[accomplice]]s: there were the ''question ordinaire'' (&quot;ordinary questioning&quot;), the ordinary form of torture, and the ''question extraordinaire'' (&quot;extraordinary questioning&quot;), with increased brutality. There was little [[presumption of innocence]] if the suspect was a mere poor [[commoner]]. The death sentence could be pronounced for a variety of crimes including mere [[theft]]; depending on the crime and the social class of the victim, death could be by [[decapitation]] with a [[sword]] (for nobles), [[hanging]] (for most of the secondary crimes by commoners), the [[breaking wheel]] (for some heinous crimes by commoners), and even [[burning at the stake]] (for [[heresy]], or advocacy of [[atheism]]). Some crimes, such as [[regicide]], exacted even more horrific punishment. With the spread of enlightenment ideas throughout France, most forms of judicial torture had fallen out of favor, and while they remained on the books, were rarely applied after 1750.

Ultimately, judicial torture and cruel methods of executions were abolished in 1788 by King [[Louis XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.rutgers.edu/graduate/ab93silv.htm Abstract of dissertation &quot;'Pour savoir la verité de sa bouche': The Practice and Abolition of Judicial Torture in the Parlement of Toulouse, 1600-1788&quot;] by Lisa Silverman.&lt;/ref&gt;

In current [[French language]] usage, '''parlement''' means [[parliament]] as in the English expression [[Parliament of France]]. It is quite a different meaning than the role of the ''parlements'' under the Ancien Régime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">{{For|the ancient Roman office|tribune}}
The '''Tribunat''' was one of the four assemblies set up in France by the [[Constitution of Year VIII]] (the other three were the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], the [[Corps législatif (Consulate)|Corps législatif]] and the [[Sénat conservateur]]). It was set up officially on 1 January 1800 at the same time as the 
[[Corps législatif]]. Its first president was the historian [[Pierre Daunou]], whose independent spirit led to his dismissal from the post by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1802. The Tribunat assumed some of the functions of the [[Council of Five Hundred]], but its role consisted only of deliberating projected laws before their adoption by the [[Corps législatif (Consulate)|Corps législatif]], with the legislative initiative remaining with the Council of State.

== Elections ==
As with elections to the [[Corps législatif]], members of the Tribunat were not elected by direct [[universal suffrage]]. They were chosen via a complex process by the [[Sénat conservateur|Senate]] from the &quot;national lists of notables&quot; (&quot;listes nationales de notabilités&quot;) set up following a series of votes &quot;en cascade&quot; - the citizens would first elect &quot;communal notables&quot; from one tenth of their number, who would choose &quot;departmental notables&quot; from one tenth of their number, who would in turn choose &quot;national notables&quot; from another one tenth of their number.

== Functions ==
The Tribunat's function was to send three orators to discuss proposed laws with government orators in the presence of the [[Corps législatif (Consulate)|Corps législatif]]. It could not vote on such laws, but its decisions did have some consequence, if only as a consultative opinion, with the final decision always coming back as a last resort to the [[First Consul]], who might or might not take the Tribunat's opinion into account. The Tribunat could also ask the [[Sénat conservateur|Senate]] to overturn &quot;the lists of eligibles, the acts of the Legislative Body and those of the government&quot; on account of unconstitutionality, but the Tribunat's opinion was, once again, non-binding.

== History ==
Shortly after the [[coup d'état]] of [[18 Brumaire]], the Tribunat became a focus of opposition to the regime the First Consul was in the process of setting up. Also, on 7 January, [[Benjamin Constant]] entered  the Tribunat and, in a speech that made him leader of the opposition, denounced &quot;the regime of servitude and silence&quot; Bonaparte was preparing. The Tribunat was made up of liberal personalities like Constant, whose independent point of view Bonaparte saw as prejudicial to the public order and political unity he was trying to establish. Thus it was first purged after its opposition to the projected Code civil in 1802 (a purge made possible by a manoeuvre - the Tribunat was partially renewed at the regular interval, but it was unknown who in the Tribunat would be the first to be removed, and therefore Napoleon chose his opponents), then suppressed by a decree of the Senate in 1807, with its remaining functions and members absorbed into the Corps législatif.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/legislation/c_tribunate.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable that the Corps législatif tended to reinforce the powers of the [[executive (government)|executive]]. The introduction of the plebiscite, reducing the chambers' legitimacy and thus their power, had the same aim. The Tribunat was an organ intended to improve separation of powers, but the way that the separation of powers was structured did not let the Tribunat run effectively.

==Organisation and constitution==
The [[Constitution of Year VIII]] organised the Tribunat:
{{cquote|Article 27. The Tribunat is to be made up of 100 members aged at least 25; they are to be renewed every fifth year, and may be re-elected indefinitely if they are still on the national list.}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/legislation/c_constitution8.html#title3&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of the Year X|Constitution of 16 thermidor year X]] (4 August 1802) foresaw:
{{Cquote|Starting in year XIII, the Tribunat will be reduced to 50 members. - Half of the 50 will leave every third year. Until this reduction, the departing members will not be replaced. - The Tribunat will be divided into sections.}}

The [[Constitution of the Year XII]] stated that:

{{cquote|The functions of the members of the Tribunate continue ten years.

The Tribunate is renewed by half every five years. The first renewal shall take place for the session of the Year XVII, in conformity with the organic senatus-consultum of 16 Thermidor, Year X.

The president of the Tribunate is appointed by the Emperor out of a presentation of three candidates made by the Tribunate by secret ballot and a majority.

The functions of the president of the Tribunate continue two years.

The Tribunate has two questors.
They are appointed by the Emperor out of a triple list of candidates chosen by the Tribunate by secret ballot and a majority.
Their functions are the same as those assigned to the questors of the Legislative Body by articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 of the organic senatus-consultum of 24 Frimaire, Year XII.
One of the questors is renewed each year.

The Tribunate is divided into three sections, to wit:

Section of legislation.

Section of the interior.

Section of the finances.

Each section forms a list of three of its members from whom the president of the Tribunate designates the president of the section.
The functions of the president of a section continue one year.}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/legislation/c_constitution12.html#title11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sessions==
*1st session: from 1 January 1800 (11 nivôse year VIII) to 7 November 1800 (16 brumaire year IX).
*2nd session: from 22 November 1800 (1 frimaire year IX) to 7 November 1801 (16 brumaire year X).

{{sources|date=March 2014}}
The '''contributions directes''' were a system of four taxes, also known as the ''quatre vieilles'', set up under the [[French Revolution]]. They were all [[direct tax]]es, willingly voted into existence by vote of the deputies, by contrast with the [[Ancien Régime]], which mainly relied on [[indirect tax]]es.

Three of them were set up in 1790 by the [[National Constituent Assembly]]:
* the '''contribution foncière''', on all lands ;
* the '''contribution mobilière''', on all income not derived from commerce or 'land' (with the latter including rent and industry)
* the '''patente''', which taxed the professions according to their external signs
The fourth, the ''impôt sur les portes et fenêtres'' (comparable to the British [[window tax]]) was set up in 1798 by the [[French Directory]]. This one was not called a contribution, and was progressive.

Until the [[First French Empire]], these for direct taxes raised enough for the state budget, but the [[Napoleonic Wars]] led to the re-establishment of indirect taxation.

&lt;!---
===Contribution foncière===

La contribution foncière (loi des 23 novembre - 1{{er}} décembre 1790) est assise sur les biens fonciers. Elle remplace la [[Taille (impôt)|taille]] réelle des anciens [[pays d'État]] et la taille personnelle des [[pays d'élection|pays d’élection]], mais concerne tous les biens. Seul le propriétaire est imposé sur la valeur locative de ses biens.

===Contribution personnelle mobilière===

La contribution personnelle mobilière (loi des 13 janvier - 18 février 1791) est assise essentiellement sur le logement. La valeur du loyer de l'habitation du contribuable devait permettre une évaluation approximative de son revenu.

===Patent===

La [[patente]] (loi du 2-17 mars 1791) est assise sur l'industrie et le commerce. Elle n'atteint les revenus industriels et commerciaux qu'indirectement, par le truchement du loyer, comme les autres contributions. Ainsi, par exemple, son tarif est fixé à deux ou trois sols par livre du loyer des boutiques, magasins ou ateliers (10 à 15 %).---&gt;

[[File:Letters on a Regicide Peace.jpg|thumb|1796 title page]]
'''''Letters on a Regicide Peace''''' or '''''Letters ... on the Proposals for Peace with the Regicide Directory of France''''' were a series of four letters written by [[Edmund Burke]] during the 1790s in opposition to Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]'s seeking of peace with the [[Directoire|revolutionary French Directorate]]. It was completed and published in 1796.

==Background==
By January 1796, Burke was finishing his ''Letter on a Regicide Peace'', and parts of it were already printed. However, the work was delayed and it was published 20 October 1796, together with the second letter, as ''Two Letters on a Regicide Peace''. An unauthorized version, printed by John Owen, a printer who had worked on the letters earlier in the year, appeared the day before Burke's edition was published. Burke's letters were popular, and the work went into 11 editions by the end of 1796.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell 1991 pp. 187, 22&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the letters written, but the third in the series, was occasioned by the inability of Pitt's ministry to make peace with France; on 19 December 1796, Britain's envoy was expelled by the French. The letter included the subtitle &quot;On the rupture of the negotiations, the terms of peace proposed, and the resources of the country for the continuance of the war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1992 p. 562&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth letter, addressed to [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|William Fitzwilliam]], was written following Burke's reading of [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|William Eden]]'s ''Some Remarks on the Apparent Circumstances of the War in the Fourth Week of October 1795''. When Pitt's government tried to negotiate peace with France, Burke stopped composing the letter and instead published what became the first two letters, called ''Two Letters on a Regicide Peace''. Burke attempted to rewrite the letter to Fitzwilliam, but he did not finish before dying. The 1812 edition of his works did include a copy of the fourth letter that was pieced together from a manuscript copy by Burke, an uncorrected manuscript, and parts of the third letter's proof sheet.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell 1991 p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letters==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|right|thumb|Edmund Burke, author of ''Letters on a Regicide Peace'']]
Burke, in the third letter, attacks all of the British parties that desire peace with France, because France was intent on attacking Britain:&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1992 pp. 564–566&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;That day was, I fear, the fatal term of ''local'' patriotism. On that day, I fear, there was an end of that narrow scheme of relations called our country, with all its pride, its prejudices, and its partial affects. All the little quiet rivulets, that watered an humble, a contracted, but not an unfruitful field, are to be lost in the waste expanse, and boundless, barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of France. It is no longer an object of terrour, the aggrandizement of a new power, which teaches as a professor that philanthropy in their chair; whilst it propagates by arms, and establishes by conquest, the comprehensive system of universal fraternity. In what light is all this viewed in a great assembly? The party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehensions, except those that arise from not being admitted to the closest and most confidential connexions with the metropolis of that fraternity. That reigning party no longer touches on its favourite subject, the display of those horrours, that must attend the existence of a power, with such dispositions and principles, seated in the heart of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1842 p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the fourth letter, Burke personalises the events in France for an English audience:&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer 2005 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Should we not obtest Heaven, and whatever justice is yet on Earth? Oppression makes wise men mad; but their distemper is still the madness of the wise, which is better than the sobriety of fools. Their cry is the voice of sacred misery, exalted not into wild raving, but into the sanctified phrensy of prophecy and inspiration - in that bitterness of soul, in that indignation of suffering virtue, in the exaltation of despair, would not persecuted English loyalty cry out, with an awful warning voice, and denounce the destruction that waits on Monarchs?&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1796 pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Themes==
Burke relies on a [[Juvenal|Juvenalian style]] to connect the events of the [[French Revolution]] to England. The language used compares wisdom with anger and connects feelings of indignation with the right manner of living. He, like Juvenal, calls upon his audience to react to the decaying world with a response based in both emotion and virtue. The language also connects to the epic tradition of both [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Homer]] by using images from their epics that call upon people to act, instead of allowing events to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer 2005 pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters also stigmatise Pitt's actions towards a peace with France as appeasing the French nation, which was the wrong way to act in Burke's view. Burke was confident that the war against France was waged against what Revolutionary France represented, and that the English were not fighting against the French nation but against the revolutionaries that were spreading an ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Prior 1854 pp. 439-444&lt;/ref&gt; In the third letter, Burke mentions that the French had a fleet that could have sent troops into Ireland and aid the Irish in rebelling against Britain. The French, at the same time that they stated that they wanted to continue negotiating peace were sending troops to invade. As such, Burke hints at a possible impeachment of Pitt for seeking peace with France.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1992 pp. 566–567&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's change from the letter to Fitzwilliam to the ''Letters on a Regicide Peace'' showed him turning to address what the government was doing in terms of peace. The views in his first two letters emphasized how Jacobite political beliefs would not allow for peace with France. Although the letter was supposed to deal with an event happening at the moment, the delay disrupted its timeliness. The published letters were able to convince  ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', which stated that such a peace would be impossible.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell 1991 pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's stance on the French Revolution was similar to Fitzwilliam's, and the two advocated for their mutual position, which included a restoration of the French monarchy and the sense that a peace with France would be a humiliation and a defeat for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1975 pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Although the work was popular, many people attacked the first two letters from both sides of the political spectrum. The government's paper the ''True Briton'' attacked Burke's language and claimed that his ideas about restoring the French monarchs would be impossible. ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'', an opposition paper, claimed that Burke was working with the government and that the letters were a government plot to gain opposition to a peace with France.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell 1991 pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Thelwall]], a democrat and radical, was upset by his belief that Burke assumed that only a portion of the population, the informed individuals, should be understood as the public. Thelwall also opposed Burke's descriptions of British [[Jacobitism|Jacobin]]s and believed that Burke wanted to legalize their execution. [[James Mackintosh]] believed that Burke had a strong linguistic power and agreed that war could be necessary but not with France. To restore the French monarchy, to Mackintosh, would go against France's right as a nation and remove its independence.  The only way for the opponents of France to do what is right is for them to be objective and balanced. [[William Roscoe]], a Unitarian liberal, believed that Burke misunderstood the French revolution and that the British were the aggressors in the situation.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell 1991 pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The French Revolution''''' is a poem written by [[William Blake]] in 1791. It was intended to be seven books in length, but only one book survives. In that book, Blake describes the problems of the [[King of France|French monarchy]] and seeks the [[Storming of the Bastille|destruction of the Bastille]] in the name of [[Political freedom|Freedom]].

==Background==
Blake felt that there was a strong connection between the [[American War of Independence|American]] and [[French revolution]]s and that these revolutions had a universal and historical impact.&lt;ref&gt;Altizer 1985 pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; ''The French Revolution'' was intended as a poetic history of these current events in Blake's life and was supposed to be an account of Blake's understanding of the [[French Revolution]] described in seven books of poetry first published in 1791.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damon pp. 145–146&quot;&gt;Damon 1988 pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; Although Blake was not part of any radical political organizations in England at the time of the French Revolution, his works suggest a connection to revolutionary thought and the poem serves as his involvement in the debate over the merits of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton 1997 p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the French Revolution and the support of it in England, there was a series of attacks upon the supporters which led to the imprisonment of [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], the printer of ''French Revolution''. This possibly disrupted the completion of the books, as Johnson was just starting to print the first book, and the project was discontinued. The only pages that survived are the original proofs for the first book, which are now in the collection of the [[Huntington Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Damon pp. 144–146&quot;&gt;Damon 1988 pp. 144–146&lt;/ref&gt; Although it cannot be known why Johnson stopped printing Blake's poem, he did print other works by Blake including ''For Children'' and ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience|Songs of Innocence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2003 pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; The poem currently appears in only one proof copy, and there are few references to ''The French Revolution'' until the 20th century. One of these is from [[Samuel Palmer]], a follower of Blake, who wrote on 10 October 1827 that he wished to find a copy of the poem. The other is from [[Alexander Gilchrist]], an early biographer of Blake, who wrote on 24 November 1860 to [[John Linnell]], a collector of Blake's works, requesting to see the manuscript of ''The French Revolution''&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 1995 pp. 6, 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poem==
The work is an [[anapest]]ic [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] [[septenary]] poem, a poetic meter unique in Blake's poetry to this poem, that describes the events surrounding the French Revolution. Blake was an early supporter of the American Revolution and believed that it would bring about liberty to the rest of mankind. The French, according to Blake, were stuck in a problematic [[feudal system]] that was represented by the [[Bastille]], a prison that kept enemies of the state. As the work continues, he demands that the Bastille be removed and he explains how the American Revolution provoked the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damon pp. 144–146&quot;/&gt;

The dates spanned in the first book is from May 1789 until July 1789. Although Blake relies on history, he includes characters that are his own, but none of them are characters that he used in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|mythological works]]. The work deals with the symbolism of the Bastille, which the seven towers of the Bastille representing a character type that was repressed by an oppressive government. As the work progresses, a dispute over governmental systems involves many characters including the representative of the feudal system, called Peer, Duke of Burgundy, and the Archbishop of Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damon pp. 145–146&quot;/&gt;

==Themes==
Within the work, Blake emphasizes the problems of the feudal system and the corruption and decay of the [[King of France|French monarchy]] and church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damon pp. 144–146&quot;/&gt; The poem operates, according to G. E. Bentley, as a &quot;[[psychomachia]], a war of spirits, of the spirits of freedom and privilege. Some of the noblest rhetoric in the poem defends the ancient bastions of civilization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2003 p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The language that Blake relies on in the poem is very political, but Blake felt that language in such discussions is replaced by rhetoric. In order to overcome that problem, he attempts to return to an original language.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton 1997 p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolution is a recurring theme in Blake's works. In Blake's ''[[America a Prophecy|America]]'', his views are expressed in the character of [[Orc (Blake)|Orc]]. In ''The French Revolution'', the ideas expressed are in direct contrast to those who stood against the French Revolution, including [[Edmund Burke]]. He accomplishes this by merging myth with history in order to create an apocalyptic vision that connects with the revolution. Other Romantic poets use [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] imagery, but Blake's interpretation has a strong moral foundation. Like Blake's view of the American Revolution, in ''America'', or the views expressed in ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', the politics of the time are incorporated into a greater [[William Blake's mythology|myth system]].&lt;ref&gt;Crafton 1997 pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:bouchedefer.jpg|thumb|First issue of ''La Bouche de fer'' (''Mouth of Iron'')]]

The '''Society of the Friends of Truth''' ('''Amis de la Verité'''), also known as the '''Social Club''', was a French revolutionary organization founded in 1790. It was &quot;a mixture of revolutionary political club, the Masonic Lodge, and a literary salon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution'', PUF, 1989, page 196&lt;/ref&gt;  It also published an influential revolutionary newspaper, the ''Mouth of Iron''.

==The inception==
The Society of the Friends of Truth was established by [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Claude Fauchet]], who announced its birth in the popular press on 21 February 1790. The original purpose of the club was to become a &quot;clearing-house&quot; for correspondence between and among scholars from all over Europe. In the spirit of its founders, the Club wished to cultivate a &quot;public mandate&quot; under which its activities would be governed. Thus, its newsletter, ''Mouth of Iron'' (''La Bouche de fer''), solicited letters from readers to comment on political affairs and to issue denunciations of counter-revolutionary plots.

The Club was actually launched in the month of October 1790, when the sessions &quot;of the Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth&quot; at the [[Cirque du Palais-Royal]] started. Before an audience that ranged from five thousand to eight thousand people every week, Claude Fauchet, self-appointed &quot;attorney of Truth&quot;, lectured on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s 1762 work ''[[The Social Contract]]''. The Club also formulated political theories on democratic government, ultimately dismissing direct democracy in favor of a system that resembled a popularly-elected dictatorship that could be dismissed by the citizens whenever its actions became insupportable. The Social Club also advocated steps toward a more equitable distribution of wealth, always with an eye to Rousseau's ideals, but the Club did ''not'' support land reform.

The meetings were described in detail in the &quot;Mouth of Iron&quot;, which published the proceedings of the Fauchet lectures and discussions and the mail that arrived following them. This publication is important for understanding the genesis of democratic ideas during the [[French Revolution]]. The Social Club was also the first revolutionary group to identify itself clearly as a ''cosmopolitan organization'', meaning that its aims superseded national boundaries. It made appeals to scholars worldwide, and it produced a polyglot edition of the 1791 Constitution for distribution globally. Its goal was to create a universal republic led by scholars.

==Membership and adherents==
Key figures attending the Social Club included [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Claude Fauchet]], as well as [[Sylvain Maréchal]], [[François-Noël Babeuf|&quot;Gracchus&quot; Babeuf]], [[:fr:Guillaume-François-Charles Goupil de Préfeln|Goupil de Préfeln]], [[Camille Desmoulins]], [[Bertrand Barère]], and the [[Marquis de Condorcet]]. About one-hundred-thirty persons were members and attended meetings regularly.

The meetings were public because the club wanted to show the widest possible audience what discourse in the atmosphere of a [[Salon (gathering)|literary or philosophical salon]] might accomplish. (This explains the choice of the [[Cirque du Palais-Royal]] as a meeting-place, rather than some smaller venue like a private home.) Spectators were invited to ask questions, and a resolution was passed at the end of each session.

In 1791, the membership of the Social Club openly declared themselves [[Republicanism#French and Swiss thought|republicans]]. It then became a meeting place for the [[Girondist]]s, who rivaled the [[Jacobins]] for primacy of republican ideology and action. The Club's political orientation was liberal, and it promoted the ideal of a society composed of small and medium economic producers: craftsmen, farmers, merchants, and entrepreneurs.

The members of the Social Club also considered themselves contemporary feminists, and while no remarkable feminist change would come out of the club, the members of the club helped individually to develop the framework for what would become the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]''. [[Olympe de Gouges]], the author of the ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman'', was a member of the club and would often develop her ideas through the liberal conduit of the Social Club. While the members did proclaim themselves supporters of republican ideals publicly, their embrace of feminists ideals was regarded as much more treasonous (and as such, was quite under wraps).&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, Donna. ''Margaret Fuller: Writing a Woman's Life''. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993). ISBN 0-312-09145-1, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1791 on, the Club's offices operated a publishing business. It became a center for the dissemination of revolutionary literature, including numerous newspapers, political pamphlets, theatrical works, poetry, posters, etc. A number of seminal authors, [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier#Political views|Louis-Sébastien Mercier]], [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif|Nicolas-Edme Rétif de la Bretonne]], [[Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[Condorcet]], [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], and [[Jean-Marie Roland]], were published under the Club's auspices.

After the fall of the Girondins, the Club dissolved. Fauchet was arrested and executed on 31 October 1793. Bonneville, the printer, resumed activity after [[9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794). His press tried to resurrect the Social Club, but it never regained its previous audience. In a fragmented state, it continued to exist until [[Brumaire]] of year VIII (November 1800). By then, ideologues like [[Pierre Claude François Daunou|Daunou]], [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Volney]], [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton|Daubenton]], and [[Claude Louis Berthollet|Berthollet]] held center stage.

The ''Amis de la Verité'' was fondly remembered, and it became a touchstone for the romantics of the nineteenth century, like [[Charles Nodier]] and [[Victor Hugo]], but it was also highly esteemed among politicians and social theorists such as [[Charles Fourier]], [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], and [[Karl Marx]].

==The ''Mouth of Iron''==

''La Bouche de fer'', the ''Mouth of Iron'', may have derived its name, sardonically, from [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]]'s observation about [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 96 BC)|the consul, Domitius]], &quot;that it was no wonder that a man who had a beard of brass, also had a mouth of iron and a heart of lead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' xviii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suet&quot;&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Nero,'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ix. 1. § 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' ii. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Others hold that the name comes from a mailbox in the shape of a lion's mouth, located at the headquarters of the Club, at No. 4, rue du Théâtre-Français, where letters, petitions, proposals, denunciations, screeds, and other treatises could be deposited. A third theory is that this name, ''Mouth of Iron'', was the same name as a lodge of freemasons to which Bonneville and Fauchet had once belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Copin-Albancelli]], ''Le drame maçonnique. Le Pouvoir occulte contre la France'', 1908, p.334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the ''Mouth of Iron'' was published in Paris between October 1790 and 28 July 1791, at first, three times per week, then daily, beginning on 22 June 1791. The newsletter contained comments on &quot;The Social Contract&quot; of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, essays by Claude Fauchet, transcripts of speeches by Condorcet, petitions from the ''Club of the [[Cordeliers]]'', etc. A subscription cost thirty-six pounds (livres) per year, and anyone who subscribed was automatically made a member of the Social Club; so, since casual readers and curiosity-seekers were counted as members, the size of the Club's membership was probably somewhat overstated.

''La Bouche de fer'' was the origin{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} of the famous quote, often attributed to [[Denis Diderot]]: ''&quot;Quand le dernier des rois sera pendu avec les boyaux du dernier prêtre célibataire, le genre humain pourra espérer être heureux.&quot;'' (&quot;When the last king is hanged with the entrails of the last celibate priest, mankind may hope to be happy.&quot;)

The '''[[French Revolution]]''' influenced the '''English [[gothic novel]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |jstor=2872912 |title=Gothic Fiction and the French Revolution
|author=R Paulson |journal=ELH |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gothic novel]] combines elements of terror and romance, and the supernatural. English novelist [[Fanny Burney]] wrote at the time of the [[French Revolution]] that, &quot;There is nothing in old history that I shall any longer think fabulous; the destruction of the most wonderful empires on record has nothing more wonderful, nor of more sounding improbability, than the demolition of this great nation, which rises up against itself for its own ruin-perhaps annihilation.&quot; A year later in 1790, English statesman [[Edmund Burke]] wrote that the French Revolution was, &quot;the most astonishing that has hitherto happened to the world.&quot; The gothic novel was therefore a way for English writers to come to terms with what they considered to be wonderful and astounding events, perceiving what happened to their neighbors in France and with the consequences upon their own society.&lt;ref&gt;Prickett, S: &quot;England and the French Revolution&quot;, page 1. Macmillan Education, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Creating elements of terror and fantasy gave expression to their anxieties of what was to come, and gave voice to their incredulousness at the events taking place in France. Because of the French Revolution and France's proximity to England, English writers  during that period were concerned with the concept of violent and inclusive change in the human condition.  The gothic novel contains modes of nightmarish terror, violence, and sexual rapacity. These modes coincided with the mood and modes of violence brought forth during the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/romantic/welcome.htm |title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Romantic Age: Introduction |publisher=Wwnorton.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper echelon of English society mostly perceived the French Revolution as threatening to the status quo and stability of their accustomed lifestyle, and as a danger to their personal safety and social position within the hierarchy. It has been suggested that the gothic novel with its themes of terror and violence gave English writers a safe expression of their anxieties about disruption and chaos. They also worked to uphold the political normalcy and traditional morals of the time. Examples of this can be seen in [[Anne Radcliffe]]'s female characters being submissive and incapable of making their own decisions, upholding traditional values of a patriarchal society.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_18c/radcliffe/index.html |title=Ann Radcliffe |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
The dissent that occurred during the French Revolution was not only violent, it also led to women questioning their role in society and to a debate on the nature of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; This debate can be seen in one of the most famous gothic novels, [[Frankenstein]] by [[Mary Shelley]]. In her novel she engages in a discussion of women's nature by having a man with the power to create new life instead of the woman, and its consequences. [[Jane Austen]] also engaged in this discussion in her gothic novel, [[Northanger Abbey]]. Catherine Morland, the protagonist of the novel, has to confront the workings of the political and economic system that involves women as chess pieces in marriages and of power relationships, after her visions of romance are over. In this novel one can also see how the mind can take a truth by means other than texts, many times removed from actual events. This speaks to the perception that the English had of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, A:  ''The Impact of the French Revolution on English Literature'', page 40. Aarhus University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caleb Williams==
The gothic novel, [[Caleb Williams]] by [[William Godwin]] can be seen as an example of the influence the events of the French revolution had on the genre. The main character, Caleb Williams is of humble birth, an unusual circumstance for Godwin to write, since his usual characters are about people of wealth and title.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, A: &quot;The French Revolution and the English Novel&quot;, page 93. The Knickerbocker Press, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; A key component of the French Revolution was the underlying principal that the political institutions of France should be founded on the equality of all citizens regardless of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeahuntsic.qc.ca/pagesdept/hist_geo/Atelier/Parcours/1789/acteurs1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706200526/http://www.collegeahuntsic.qc.ca/pagesdept/hist_geo/Atelier/Parcours/1789/acteurs1.htm |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The preface and subtitle of Caleb Williams also give the reader need to recognize social theory as the main purpose of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, A: &quot;The French Revolution and the English Novel&quot;, page 116. The Knickerbocker Press, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; This novel is classified as one of the best examples of the &quot;victim-of-society story.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, A: &quot;The French Revolution and the English Novel&quot;, page 202. The Knickerbocker Press, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; The main character of this novel is a morbid individualist seized with a ruling passion amounting to mania, which no reason can overcome. In this way, the protagonist of this story can be seen as a caricature of a French Revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, A: &quot;The French Revolution and the English Novel&quot;, page 223. The Knickerbocker Press, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; Before Caleb Williams, William Godwin published [[Political Justice]] underlining the philosophical principals that were pushing the French Revolution. He faced fierce hostility upon its publishing. With his later publishing of Caleb Williams a critic wrote, &quot;Fancy is a faculty which we should not have expected to find in the brain of a philosopher who had struck his hand upon his heart and felt it stone; yet fancy Mr. Godwin possesses in no common degree.&quot; Godwin's use of the fantastic in the form of the gothic novel again let him write about the philosophy of the French revolution without receiving the harsh backlash, because it was under the guise of the fantastic.&lt;ref&gt;Deane, S: &quot;The French Revolution and Enlightenment in England 1789-1832,&quot; page 85. Harvard University Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10817">{{main| Women in the French Revolution}}In pre-revolutionary France, women had no part in affairs outside the house. Before the revolution and the advent of feminism in France, women's roles in society consisted of providing heirs for their husbands and tending to household duties. Even in the upper classes, women were dismissed as simpletons, unable to understand or give a meaningful contribution to the philosophical or political conversations of the day. However, with the emergence of  ideas such as liberté, égalitée, and fraternitée, the women of France joined their voices to the chaos of the early revolution. This was the beginning of feminism in France. With demonstrations such as [[Women's March on Versailles]], and the [[Demonstration of 20 June 1792]], women displayed their commitment to the Revolution. Both the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] and the creation of the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] further conveyed their message of women's rights as a necessity to the new order of the revolution.

== Women's March to Versailles ==
{{Main|Women's March on Versailles}}

The Women's March to Versailles is one example of [[protofeminist]] militant activism during the [[French Revolution]]. Though the march was overwhelmingly made up women by all accounts, they did not make explicitly feminist demands. In the years preceding the Revolution, there was a food shortage in France. People all over the country grew agitated and called for a guarantee of food, with insufficient response from the monarchy. In October of 1789, women in the market place of Paris began marching to Versailles, spurred on by revolutionists. As they marched, they drew a large gathering, culminating in the siege of the palace and the royal family being transported to the [[Tuileries Palace]]. 

Though the crowd was led by men such as [[Stanislas-Marie Maillard]], the women's call for bread and their persistence to see their demands met, set the tone for the subsequent events led by women in the Revolution. Their resolve is exemplified by an account of a woman participating in the march, the woman Cheret. &quot;The honorable members of the National Assembly, coming to understand that the women were absolutely committed to persist until there was something definite for always, accorded to our twelve deputies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman Cheret: The Event of Paris and Versailles, by One of the Ladies Who Had the Honor to Be in the Deputation to the General Assembly|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1789|isbn=|location=Paris, France|pages=|translator-last=Mason|translator-first=Laura|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the march was not an inherently feminist event, the women of the march recalled the victory of &quot;our citizenesses clothed in glory, returned by carriage at his majesty's expense, to the city hall in Paris.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The women of the march were remembered by posterity of the French Revolution as &quot;Mothers of the Nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427855469|title=A history of the French Revolution.

== Demanding arms ==
Pauline Léon, on March 6, 1791, submitted a petition signed by 319 women to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] requesting permission to form a ''garde national'' in order to defend Paris in case of military invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Limits 23-24&quot;&gt;''Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution'' by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Léon requested permission be granted to women to arm themselves with pikes, pistols, sabers and rifles, as well as the privilege of drilling under the French Guards. Her request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;''Rebel Daughters'' by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1792, Théroigne de Méricourt made a call for the creation of &quot;legions of amazons&quot; in order to protect the revolution. As part of her call, she claimed that the [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] would transform women into citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Limits 23-24&quot;/&gt;

== Participation in demonstrations ==
On June 20 of 1792, a number of armed women took part in a procession that &quot;passed through the halls of the [[Legislative Assembly]], into the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries Gardens]], and then through the King's residence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Rebel Daughters'' by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Militant women also assumed a special role in the funeral of [[Jean-Paul Marat]], following his murder on July 13, 1793. As part of the [[funeral procession]], they carried the bathtub in which Marat had been murdered as well as a shirt stained with Marat's blood.&lt;ref&gt;''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on May 20, 1795, women were at the fore of a crowd that demanded &quot;bread and the [[Constitution of 1793]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Society 24&quot;&gt;''Gender, Society and Politics: France and Women 1789-1914'' by James H. McMillan pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; When their protest went unnoticed, the women went on a rampage, &quot;sacking shops, seizing grain and kidnapping officials.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Society 24&quot;/&gt;

== Declaration of the Rights of Women and Female Citizens ==
{{Main|Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen}}

While largely ignored in their endeavors to increase the rights of citizens in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], activists such as [[Pauline Léon]] and [[Théroigne de Méricourt]] agitated for full citizenship for women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daughters 79&quot;&gt;''Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution'' Edited by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Limits 23-24&quot;/&gt; Yet, women were &quot;denied political rights of '[[active citizenship]]' (1791) and democratic citizenship (1793).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daughters 79&quot;/&gt; In 1791, Olympe de Gouges published a vital document of the Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen. In it, de Gouges replicated the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, but altered the language to reflect the concerns of women's rights within France. She addressed her declaration to the Queen, [[Marie Antoinette]], pleading with her to &quot;work for the restoration of morals, to give to your sex all the credit it is due.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Declaration of the Rights of Women and the Female Citizen|last=de Gouges|first=Olympe|publisher=|year=1791|isbn=|location=Paris, France|pages=204-210|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this document did not have extensive social repercussions within France during the time of the Revolution, de Gouges revealed the depths of misogynistic culture by the reaction to her work. Following her publication, she was tried as having &quot;royalist tendencies&quot;, further evidenced by her political pamphlets and discovery of her half-written play, ''La France sauvée ou le tyran détrondé.'' Though according to de Gouges, the accusation was based on a misunderstanding of her texts as anti-revolutionary, feminist historian Janie Vanpée took the stance that her trial was &quot;not one of holding opinions from the wrong side of the political spectrum, but rather of articulating political opinions at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literate Women of the French Revolution|last=Venee|first=Janie|publisher=Summa Publication|year=1994|isbn=|location=Birmingham, Alabama|pages=56|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gouges' execution in 1793, one of only three women to be executed in the Reign of Terror, solidified her appraisal of men within the Revolution as &quot;pretend[ing] to enjoy the Revolution and reclaim his rights to equality only to say nothing more about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Society of Revolutionary Republican Women ==
{{Main|Society of Revolutionary Republican Women}}

The most radical militant feminist activism was practiced by the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women which was founded by Léon and her colleague [[Claire Lacombe]] on May 10, 1793.&lt;ref&gt;''Rebel Daughters'' by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the club was &quot;to deliberate on the means of frustrating the projects of the enemies of the Republic.&quot; Up to 180 women attended the meetings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;''Deviant Women of the French Revolution and the Rise of Feminism'' by Lisa Beckstrand pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Of special interest to the Society was &quot;combating [[hoarding]] [of grain and other staples] and [[inflation]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
Most of these outwardly activist women were punished for their actions. The kind of punishment received during the Revolution included public denouncement, arrest, execution, or exile. Théroigne de Méricourt was arrested, publicly flogged and then spent the rest of her life sentenced to an insane asylum. Pauline Léon and Claire Lacombe were arrested, later released, and continued to receive ridicule and abuse for their activism. Many of the women of the Revolution were even publicly executed for &quot;conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Deviant Women'' by Beckstrand pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
These are but a few examples of the militant protofeminism that was prevalent during the French Revolution. While little progress was made toward [[gender equality]] during the Revolution, the activism of French women and protofeminists was bold and particularly significant in Paris. Though French culture during the time of the Revolution was largely misogynistic, leading women such as Madame Roland, Olympe de Gouges, and [[Charlotte Corday]] went against the traditional roles of gender and fought the mindset of a woman as passive, uneducated, and politically ignorant. According to author and historian Catherine R. Montfort, &quot;a woman is always a woman biologically, but the ways in which she can be one are constructed by her culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literate Women of the French Revolution|last=Monfort|first=Catherine R.|publisher=Summa Publications|year=1994|isbn=978-1883479077|location=Birmingham, AL|pages=6|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects on women's rights of the French Revolution is debated among historians. For some, the French Revolution eroded women's right by decreasing the role of women in public life due to the repressive measures that were brought into place by the Jacobins. However, for others, the change in psyche that allowed women to establish a gender-based consciousness and the reforms to marriage, divorce and property rendered a significant and ground breaking change to feminist identities and the future of the feminist movement.

==In France==

===Citizenship during the French Revolution===
During the [[French Revolution]], a distinction was made for a time between '''active and passive citizens'''. In 1791, the Legislative Assembly was chosen by a process of indirect election; the Electors of the Assembly were themselves elected by &quot;active&quot; citizens, male citizens whose annual taxes equalled the local wages paid for three days of labour. This disfranchised about half of the male citizens of France. Even higher economic requirements for the Electors and the members of the Assembly left only about 50,000 eligible men in a country of some 25 million people.

===Slavery===
Slavery, throughout the Revolution, remained common in the colonies.  The abolition of slavery in the colonies would have affected planters who were represented in the assemblies by deputies, particularly the Lameths.  The coloured free saw that their rights were being taken from them and finally on this date in 1791 the assembly decided to withdraw their civil rights. However, after the [[Haitian Revolution]]{{dubious|rationale=The Revolution ended in 1804, so the latter saying &quot;1794&quot; because of the fought freedom of blacks doesn't make sense as they were still fighting to be free|date=May 2016}} and new freedom of blacks in French colonies, in 1794 radical Jacobins reinstated the rights of blacks. Furthermore, slavery was abolished in all French colonies, and free blacks of those colonies were made electable to the French government as colonial representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mcphee|first1=Peter|title=The French Revolution;; 1789-1799|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this the rights for free association for workers and the right to strike were also taken away.  After a series of strikes on June 14, 1791 in workshops located in Paris, the [[Loi Le Chapelier]] was passed.  The intention was to establish a free labour market by forbidding associations by workers and also the formation of trade unions.

===Voting Rights===
It remained that all had the right to contribute towards the making of the laws, but on December 23, 1789 voting rights only extended to property owners.  This reflected a belief that only those who had a stake in decisions made for society as a whole and those who had shown they could manage their own affairs should be eligible for political involvement.  Three categories were created to divide the citizens of France: Passive Citizens, Active Citizens, and the Electors.
The only members of society that could vote were the members that paid a certain amount of taxes.

===Passive Citizens===
'''Passive Citizens''' were those who had no property rights or voting rights.  They were entitled to protection by law with relation to their belongings and their liberty, but had no say in the making of government bodies.  This group totalled around three million men within France. The constitution of 1791 reduced the women of France to passive citizens.

===Active Citizens===
'''Active Citizens''' numbered around four million men.  They were literate adults who could use reason.  They needed to speak French and have been a resident for more than one year. They had a stake in the government bodies.  They paid taxes equal to about three days work a year, a sum of about 1 ½ and 3 [[livres]].  These men met in primary assemblies (assemblees primaires) to nominate electors and members of the councils in their municipalities.  Active citizens (and their sons over the age of 18) were also, in that period, the basis for the [[French National Guard]], the military bastion of the middle class.

===Electors===
Roughly one in every hundred active citizens became '''electors'''.  Electors paid taxes equal to 10 days work a year: typically 5 to 10 livres.  There were about 50,000 electors in France at the time. These electors also met in assemblies where they nominated deputies, judges, and members of other departments.

===System of Elections===
This new system of elections and electoral rights managed to remove common people from political involvement. The laws were applied to all equally, with the idea that everyone had passive citizenship rights.  There was no expectation that passive citizens would become active citizens. Because of the belief that women could not use reason to deliberate, active citizens could only be men.

[[Vincent Ogé]] argued that coloured people or &quot;[[gens de couleur]]&quot; owned properties and should be considered for active citizenship. Unfortunately, the assembly felt that this would disrupt their trade overseas and they could not do anything that would hinder that trade.

Passive citizens could be aware of political arena by reading newspapers and even by attending political meetings.  Political groups and clubs arose as the Revolution progressed. These groups began to hold organized demonstrations and circulated petitions. Newspapers of the time had a lot of political influence.

The Constitutional committee felt that qualification by property ownership would result in passive citizens competing to become active citizens. They felt that the passive citizens would fight with more eagerness to become rich in hopes of owning property and becoming active citizens and maybe even electors.

This system of representation by the amount of taxes paid left society in the hands of the rich. [[Camille Desmoulins]] said it best, “ […] but what on earth is meant by this expression ‘active citizens’ which we hear repeated so often? Active citizens are the men who stormed the Bastille, those who work the land, whereas the idle members of the Court and the clergy, despite the vast estates which they own, are nothing more than vegetables, vegetables like that tree in scripture which bore no fruit and which was therefore condemned to be thrown into the fire and burned.”

==In modern usage==
{{main article|Active citizenship}}
In the 20th and 21st century debates on [[illegal immigration]], &quot;passive citizenship&quot; refers to the limited rights enjoyed by non-citizens in another country of current residence: they cannot meaningfully state. Furthermore, it also refers to the lack of participation of registered citizens in the benefitting of their native state's people.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* November 9: The [[18 Brumaire|coup d'état of 18 Brumaire]] begins. French troops loyal to Bonaparte occupy key points in Paris. Lucien Bonaparte, the president of the Council of Five Hundred, warns the deputies that a &quot;terrorist&quot; plot against the legislature has been discovered, and asks that the meetings of the Councils, scheduled for the next day, be moved for their security to the [[Château de Saint-Cloud|château of Saint-Cloud]], some 10 kilometers west of Paris. Bonaparte is named [[Commander-in-chief]] of the army in Paris.
* As agreed in advance, two members of the Directory who are complicit in the coup: Sieyès and Ducos, offer their resignation. A third, Barras, is talked into resigning by Talleyrand. The two Jacobin directors, Gohier and [[Jean-François-Auguste Moulin|Moulin]], are arrested by the soldiers of General Moreau and confined at the [[Luxembourg Palace]]. Fouché proposes to arrest the leading Jacobin members of the Council of Five Hundred, but Bonaparte does not feel it is necessary, which proves to be a mistake. By the end of the day, Paris is entirely under the control of Bonaparte and officers loyal to him.
*November 10: As proposed by Bonaparte, the members of the two Councils are transported to the château of Saint-Cloud. 6,000 soldiers have been assembled by Bonaparte there, soldiers who are largely hostile to the Councils because of delays in their pay.
* Bonaparte speaks first to the Council of the Ancients, explaining the need for a change in government.  The upper Council listens in silence and votes without opposition to accept Bonaparte's proposal.  Bonaparte then addresses the Council of Five Hundred, meeting in the ''orangerie'' of the domain of Saint-Cloud. Here his reception is much different: the Jacobin members protest angrily, insult and shout down Bonaparte, threatening to declare him outside the law, which would have led to his immediate arrest.  While the Council debated in great confusion inside, Lucien Bonaparte takes Bonaparte outside, and tells the waiting soldiers that the deputies had tried to assassinate Bonaparte. The soldiers, furious, invade the meeting hall and chase out the deputies at the point of bayonets. In the absence of the opposition deputies, two parliamentary commissions name Bonaparte, Sieyès and Duclos as the provisional consuls of a new government.
* November 11–22: Bonaparte and the two other Provisional Consuls form a new government, [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]] as minister of War, Talleyrand in charge of foreign relations, Fouché as minister of Police, and Cambacérès as minister of Justice. 
* December 1: Bonaparte rejects a constitution proposed by Sieyès. 
* December 24: The Councils, now firmly under the control of Bonaparte, adopt the  [[Constitution of the Year VIII]]. The new [[French Consulate|Consulate]] is formally established, with Bonaparte as First Consul, Cambacérès as Second Consul, and [[Charles-François Lebrun, duc de Plaisance|Charles-François Lebrun]] as Third Consul. Traditional histories mark this date as the end of the [[French Revolution]] . {{Sfn|Tulard, Fayard and Fierro|page=410}}

In the [[history of France]], the '''First Republic''', officially the '''French Republic''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|République française}}), was founded on 21 September 1792 during the [[French Revolution]]. The First Republic lasted until the declaration of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] in 1804 under [[Napoleon]], although the form of the government changed several times. This period was characterized by the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|monarchy]], the establishment of the [[National Convention]] and the [[Reign of Terror]], the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] and the founding of the [[French Directory|Directory]], and, finally, the creation of the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and Napoleon's rise to power.

==End of the monarchy in France==
Under the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], which was in power before the proclamation of the First Republic, France was engaged in war with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]. In July 1792, the Duke of Brunswick, commanding general of the Austro–Prussian Army, issued his [[Brunswick Manifesto]], in which he threatened the destruction of Paris should any harm come to King [[Louis XVI]]. The foreign threat exacerbated France's political turmoil amid the [[French Revolution]] and deepened the passion and sense of urgency among the various factions. In the violence of [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], citizens stormed the [[Tuileries Palace]], killing six hundred of the King's [[Swiss guard]]s and insisting on the removal of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Censer, Jack R. and Hunt, Lynn. ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution.'' University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
A renewed fear of anti-revolutionary action prompted further violence, and in the first week of September 1792, mobs of Parisians broke into the city's prisons, killing over half of the prisoners. This included nobles, clergymen, and political prisoners, but also numerous common criminals, such as prostitutes and petty thieves, many murdered in their cells—raped, stabbed, and slashed to death. This became known as the [[September Massacres]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, William. ''The Oxford History of The French Revolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989. pp 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of France}}

==The National Convention==
{{Main|National Convention}}
As a result of the spike in public violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, a party of six members of France's Legislative Assembly was assigned the task of overseeing elections. The resulting Convention was founded with the dual purpose of abolishing the monarchy and drafting a new constitution. The Convention's first act, on 10 August 1792, was to establish the French First Republic and officially strip the king of all political powers. The King, by then a private citizen bearing his family name of [[Capet]], was subsequently put on trial for crimes of high treason starting in December 1792. On 16 January 1793 he was convicted, and on 21 January, he was executed by [[guillotine]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, William. The Oxford History of the French Revolution. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989. pp 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the winter of 1792 and spring of 1793, Paris was plagued by food riots and mass hunger. The new Convention did little to remedy the problem until late spring of 1793, occupied instead with matters of war. Finally, on 6 April 1793, the Convention created the [[Committee of Public Safety]] (later headed by [[Maximilien Robespierre]]), and was given a monumental task: &quot;To deal with the radical movements of the [[Enragés]], food shortages and riots, the revolt in the [[Vendée]] and in [[Brittany]], recent defeats of its armies, and the desertion of its commanding general.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The French Revolution [videorecording] : liberté, egalité, fraternité, a hitler Jr. is born in blood / produced &amp; directed by Doug Shultz ; written by Doug Shultz, Hilary Sio, Thomas Emil. [New York, N.Y.] : History Channel : Distributed in the U.S. by New Video, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notably, the Committee of Public Safety instated a policy of terror, and the guillotine began to fall on perceived enemies of the republic at an ever-increasing rate, beginning the period known today as the [[Reign of Terror]].{{citation needed|date = September 2015}}

Despite growing discontent with the National Convention as a ruling body, in June the Convention drafted the [[French Constitution of 1793|Constitution of 1793]], which was ratified by popular vote in early August. However, the Committee of Public Safety was seen as an &quot;emergency&quot; government, and the rights guaranteed by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] and the new constitution were suspended under its control. The Committee carried out thousands of executions against supposed enemies of the young Republic, to the point that the guillotine came to be known as &quot;the national razor&quot;—because it seemed to be falling on everybody's neck.&lt;ref&gt;Jack R. Censer and Lynn Hunt, ed., 2001. ''Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution''(American Social History Productions, Inc.); [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/browse/timeline/ Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's laws and policies took the revolution to unprecedented heights—they introduced the [[French Republican Calendar|revolutionary calendar]] in 1793, closed churches in and around Paris as a part of a movement of [[dechristianization]], tried and executed [[Marie Antoinette]], and instituted the [[Law of Suspects]], among others. Members of various revolutionary factions and groups were executed including the [[Hébertists]] and the [[Dantonists]].{{citation needed|date = September 2015}}

==The Directory==
After the arrest and execution of [[Robespierre]] in July 1794, the [[Jacobin club]] was closed, and the surviving [[Girondins]] were reinstated. A year later, the National Convention adopted the [[Constitution of the Year III]]. They reestablished freedom of worship, began releasing large numbers of prisoners, and most importantly, initiated elections for a new legislative body. On 3 November 1795, the [[French Directory|Directory]] was established. Under this system, France was led by a bicameral Parliament, consisting of an upper chamber called the [[Council of Ancients|Council of Elders]] (with 250 members) and a lower chamber called the [[Council of Five Hundred]] (with, accordingly, 500 members), and a collective Executive of five members called the Directory (from which the historical period gets its name). Due to internal instability, caused by [[Hyperinflation#France|hyperinflation]] of the paper monies called [[Assignats]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecurrencycollector.com/pdfs/BankNotesoftheFrenchRevolutionPartII.pdf J.E. Sandrock: &quot;Bank notes of the French Revolution&quot; and First Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; and French military disasters in 1798 and 1799, the Directory lasted only four years, until overthrown in 1799.{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}}

==The Consulate==
[[File:Bouchot - Le general Bonaparte au Conseil des Cinq-Cents.jpg|350px|left|thumb|Napoleon Bonaparte seizes power during the Coup of 18 Brumaire]]

The period known as the [[French Consulate]] began with the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]] in 1799. Members of the Directory itself planned the coup, indicating clearly the failing power of the Directory. Napoleon Bonaparte was a co-conspirator in the coup, and became head of the government as the First Consul. He would later proclaim himself Emperor of the French, ending the First French Republic and ushering in the [[French First Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.brown.edu/cds/paris/chronology2.html|title=Paris: Capital of the 19th Century|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Day-of-the-tiles.jpeg|thumb|300px|''La Journée des tuiles en 1788 à Grenoble'', 1890 painting by [[Alexandre Debelle]]]]

The '''Day of the Tiles''' ({{lang-fr|Journée des Tuiles}}) is an event that took place in the French town of [[Grenoble]] on 7 June 1788. It was among the first of the disturbances which preceded the [[French Revolution]], and is credited by a few historians as the start of it.

==Background==
Grenoble was the scene of popular unrest due to financial hardship from economic crises. These [[causes of the French Revolution]] affected all of France, but matters came to a head first in Grenoble.

Unrest in the town was sparked by the attempts of Cardinal [[Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne]], the [[Archbishop of Toulouse]] and Controller-General of [[Louis XVI]], to abolish the [[Parlement]]s in order to enact a new tax to deal with France's unmanageable public debt. Tensions in urban populations had been rising already due to poor harvests and the high cost of bread in France. These tensions were exacerbated by the refusal of the privileged classes, the Church and the aristocracy, to relinquish any of their fiscal privileges. They insisted on retaining the right to collect feudal and seignorial royalties from their peasants and landholders. This acted to block reforms attempted by the king's minister [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]] and the [[Assembly of Notables]] that he convoked in January 1787. Added to this, Brienne, appointed the king's Controller-General of Finance on 8 April 1787, was widely regarded as being a manager without experience or imagination.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodote&quot;&gt;[http://www.herodote.net/17880607.htm La «Journée des tuiles» à Grenoble], [http://www.herodote.net/ Herodote.net], Retrieved on 4 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly prior to 7 June 1788, a large meeting at Grenoble decided to call together the old Estates of the [[Dauphiné|province of Dauphiné]]. The government responded by sending troops to the area to put down the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnston&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==The riots==
At roughly 10 in the morning of Saturday, June 7, merchants closed down their shops as groups of 300 to 400 men and women formed, armed with stones, sticks, axes, bars.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coulomb|first=Clarisse|date=2016-12-12|title=Héritages familiaux, solidarités professionnelles et théâtre politique.|url=http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=RHU_005_0005|journal=Histoire urbaine|language=fr|issue=5|pages=5–25|issn=1628-0482}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rushed to the city gates to prevent the departure of judges who took part in the [[Grenoble|Gernoble]] meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.herodote.net/7_juin_1788-evenement-17880607.php|title=7 juin 1788 - La  «Journée des tuiles» à Grenoble - Herodote.net|website=www.herodote.net|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rioters attempted to cross the [[Isère (river)|Isère]] but faced a picket of 50 soldiers at the St. Lawrence bridge, while others headed to the Rue Neuve.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k454133k|title=Bulletin de l'Académie delphinale|last=texte|first=Académie delphinale Auteur du|date=1935-01-01|website=Gallica|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cathedral’s bells were seized by French peasants at noon.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The crowd swiftly grew, as the bells provoked the influx of neighboring peasants to creep in the city, climbing the walls, using boats on the [[Isère (river)|Isere]] and for some, pushing open the city gates.

Other insurgents boarded the [[rampart]]s and rushed to the hotel (''L'hôtel de la Première présidence'') the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre was staying in at the time. The Duke had two elite regiments in Grenoble,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Sgard, Les trente récits de la Journée des Tuiles.&lt;/ref&gt; the Regiment of the Royal Navy (''[[Régiment Royal–La Marine|Régiment Royal-La-Marine]])'' whose colonel was Marquis d'Ambert and the regiment of Australasia (''Régiment d'Austrasie'') which was commanded by Colonel Count Chabord. The Royal Navy was the first to respond to the growing crowds, and were given the order to quell the rioting without the use of arms. However, as the mob stormed the hotel entrance, the situation escalated. Soldiers sent to quell the disturbances forced the townspeople off the streets. Some sources say that the soldiers were sent to disperse parliamentarians who were attempting to assemble a parlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodote&quot; /&gt; During an attack, Royal Navy soldiers injured a 75 year old man with a bayonet. At the sight of blood, the people became angry and started to tear up the streets. Townspeople climbed onto the roofs of buildings around the Jesuit College&lt;ref&gt;Today the Lycée Stendhal in rue Raoul Blanchard&lt;/ref&gt; to hurl down a rain of [[Roof tiles|roof-tiles]] on the soldiers in the streets below, hence the episode's name. Many soldiers took refuge in a building to shoot through the windows, while the crowd continued to rush inside and ravage everything.

A [[Non-commissioned officer|noncommissioned officer]] of the Royal Navy, commanding a patrol of four soldiers, gave the order to open fire into the mob. One civilian was killed and a boy of 12 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Muller, ''Heurs et malheurs du Dauphiné'', p. 112-114.&lt;/ref&gt; To the east of the city, the Royal Navy soldiers were forced to open fire in order to protect the city's arsenal, fearing that the rioters would seize the weapons and ammunition. Meanwhile, Colonel Count Chabord began deploying the regiment of Australasia to aid and relieve the Royal Navy soldiers.

Three of the four city’s consults&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; gathered at the City Hall and attempted to reason with the crowd. However, their words were silenced amidst the clamor of the mob. Through great difficulty, the consults made their way through the crowds and eventually took refuge with the officers of the local garrison. Later that evening, the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre withdrew his troops from the streets and hotel to prevent further violence from escalating the situation. The Duke managed to narrowly escape the hotel before the crowd completely looted the inside. With control of the hotel lost, the Royal Navy troops were ordered to return to their quarters.

At six, a crowd estimated at ten thousand people shouting &quot;Long live the parliament&quot; forced the judges to return to the Palace of the Parliament of [[Dauphiné]] (''Palais du Parlement du Dauphiné)'' by flooding them with flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dreyfus, ''Histoire du Dauphiné'' , p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the night, [[carillon]]s sounded triumphantly, a large bonfire crackled on Saint-André square surrounded by a crowd that danced and sang &quot;Long live forever our parliament! May God preserve the King and the devil take Brienne and [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Lamoignon]]. &quot;

On June 10, the head of the first shooting officer attempted to appease the spirits of the crowd, with no success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=KQKJAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PR53&amp;dq=%22chronique+de+la+revolution%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R8OxUqXcK-uT0AWRg4FA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tuiles&amp;f=false|title=Chronique de la Révolution française|last=Chronique|first=Éditions|date=2013-06-14|publisher=Éditions Chronique|isbn=9782366020328|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the orders of exile pronounced against them by the [[Louis XVI of France|King]], the parliamentarians were forced to flee from Gernoble in the morning of June 12. It wasn’t until the 14th of July that order was fully restored in the city by Marshal Vaux, who replaced the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Chaper, ''La Journée des Tuiles à Grenoble (7 juin 1788) : Documents contemporains en grande partie inédits recueillis et publiés par un vieux bibliophile Dauphinois''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commander of the troops found the situation so alarming that he agreed to allow the meeting of the Estates to proceed, but not in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madamegilflurt.com/2014/06/the-day-of-tiles.html|title=A Covent Garden Gilflurt's Guide to Life - The Day of the Tiles|author=Catherine Curzon|work=madamegilflurt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting was therefore arranged for 21 July 1788 at the nearby village of [[Vizille]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnston&quot; /&gt; This meeting became known as the [[Assembly of Vizille]]'''.'''

In all, six outbreaks of rioting have been identified in the city during the 7th of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.histoire-pour-tous.fr/histoire-de-france/4361-la-journee-des-tuiles-grenoble-7-juin-1788.html|title=La journée des Tuiles (Grenoble, 7 juin 1788)|website=www.histoire-pour-tous.fr|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was commemorated by [[Alexandre Debelle]]'s ''The Day of the Tiles, 13 July 1788'', painted in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.com/asp/sp-asp/_/pd--12065747/sp--A/The_Day_of_the_Tiles_13_July_1788_1889.htm ''The Day of the Tiles'', 13 July 1788]&lt;/ref&gt; He painted it a century after the event and got the date wrong, but it undoubtedly attempts to depict the events described by the title.

==Later events==

The meeting of the three Estates which had been agreed to took place at Vizille on 21 July. Several hundred people assembled, representing the three Estates, the nobility, the clergy and the middle classes (the [[bourgeoisie]]), who were granted double representation. The meeting was led by a moderate reformist lawyer, [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], and passed resolutions:
*convoking the [[French Estates-General|States-General]] of France;
*pledging the province to refuse to pay all taxes not voted by the Estates-General; and
*calling for the abolition of arbitrary imprisonment on the King's order by the warrant known as the ''[[lettre de cachet]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnston&quot;/&gt;

These demands were accepted by the King. Brienne left office during August 1788, but before doing so issued a decree convoking the Estates-General for 1 May 1789.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnston&quot;/&gt; It is not clear whether this decree was prompted by the demands from the Assembly of Vizille or the Day of the Tiles, because at least one source puts the date of the decree at 7 July 1788, after the Day of the Tiles, but two weeks before the Assembly of Vizille.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popkin&quot;&gt;[http://www.safarix.com/0131930370/ch02lev1sec3 From Failed Reforms to Revolutionary Crisis],''A Short History of the French Revolution'', Jeremy D. Popkin, [[Prentice-Hall]], 14 July 2005, Retrieved on 3 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Some historians, such as Jonathan Sperber,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} have used the Day of the Tiles to demonstrate the worsening situation in France in the buildup to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. Others have even credited it with being the beginning of the revolution itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;herodote&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popkin&quot;/&gt; The events as related by R. M. Johnston&lt;ref name=&quot;johnston&quot;/&gt; provide an apparently clear link between the Day of the Tiles, the [[Assembly of Vizille]] and the start of the revolution proper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4177">'''George Grieve''' (or Greive, as he latterly spelt it), (1748-1809), was the persecutor of [[Madame Du Barry]].

Grieve was the son of Richard Grieve, an attorney, of [[Alnwick]], by Elizabeth Davidson. Both Richard and the grandfather, Ralph, a merchant, had been prominent at Alnwick in political contests, and George's elder brother, Davidson Richard, was [[high sheriff of Northumberland]] in 1788. Grieve, on coming of age, had to go to law with the corporation to take up his freedom, their plea being that his father, who had died in 1765 at the age of eighty-four, had been temporarily disfranchised at the time of George's birth.

In 1774 he took an active part in defeating the Duke of Northumberland's attempt to nominate both of the members for the county, and in 1778 he headed a mob in levelling the fences of a portion of the moor which the corporation had presented to the duke's agent. About 1780, having wasted his patrimony, he emigrated to America, where he became acquainted with Washington and other founders of the republic. He is said to have been sent on a mission to Holland, and about 1783 he took up his abode at Paris. He probably represented America in revolutionary demonstrations, and in the winter of 1792, during Madame Du Barry's visit to London in search of her stolen diamonds, he took lodgings at an inn at [[Louveciennes]], won over two of her servants to the side of the revolution, held a club in her house, and procured an order for seals to be placed on her papers and valuables.

On her return in March 1793 he drew up a list of ‘suspects’ for arrest, her name being the first, and on 1 July he escorted the municipality to the bar of the convention, where authority to apprehend her was obtained. A petition from the villagers having effected her release, he published on 31 July a virulent pamphlet entitled ‘L'égalité controuvée ou petite histoire … de la Du Barry.’ He signed himself ‘Greive, défendeur officieux des braves sans-culottes de Louveciennes, ami de Franklin et de Marat, factieux et anarchiste de premier ordre, et désorganisateur du despotisme dans les deux hémisphères depuis vingt ans.’

On 22 September he obtained a fresh order for her arrest, and escorted her part of the way to Paris in the carriage, but a petition again secured her release. On 19 Nov. she was once more apprehended. Grieve, who had wormed her secrets out of her two faithless servants, superintended the search for her jewels, concealed in dungheaps; he got up the case against her, and was himself one of the witnesses. He may have been urged on by Marat, who had invited him to dinner the very day of his assassination, but he was apparently infected with the mania of delation, for he denounced the Jacobin ex-priest Roux as Charlotte Corday's accomplice, on the ground of having seen him ‘look furious’ when calling on Marat. This denunciation, however, had no effect.

On Robespierre's fall Grieve was arrested at [[Amiens]], and was taken to Versailles, where twenty-two depositions were taken against him, but the prosecution was dropped. Returning to America, he resided at [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and published in 1796 a translation of Chastellux's ‘Travels.’ He eventually settled at Brussels, where he died 22 February 1809, the register describing him as a native of ‘Newcastel, Amérique.’ He appears to have been unmarried, and to have broken off all intercourse with his kindred. Vatel, who had examined some of his manuscripts in the [[Archives nationales (France)|National Archives, Paris]], testifies to his thorough mastery of French, and his pamphlet, the copy of which in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|French National Library]] contains autograph corrections, bespeaks a familiarity with the classics.

'''Bonnin, Charles-Jean Baptiste''' (4 October 1772 in [[France]] – October 1846) Progressive French thinker, theorist, and framer of the modern discipline of [[Public Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omarguerrero.org/archivos/BonninPAP1809.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727143231/http://www.omarguerrero.org/archivos/BonninPAP1809.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Bonnin’s written work a great political and intellectual activity is clear. His academic works credit him as a forerunner of public, constitutional and administrative law. Actually, his ‘Social Doctrine’ situates him amongst the initiators of the science later known as Sociology. He also practiced parliamentary review and was interested in educational problems. [[Auguste Comte]] described Bonnin as a “mature and energetic man, a person with a spontaneous deep kinship for positivism and in whom we can find the true spirit of the Revolution”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbot&quot;&gt;Letter to monsieur Barbot, 29 October 1846&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Cjbonnin.jpg|thumb|Charles-Jean Baptiste BONNIN]]
Bonnin was born in [[Paris]], in a family with roots in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. He studied at the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]], and afterwards served the French administration as an official in the Seine department. His parents had planned for him a career as medical doctor, a project frustrated by the events of the French Revolution, a fact that inspired in Charles-Jean Bonnin a deep interest for political issues. His true vocation was born early during his youth, thanks to the works of [[Montesquieu]], [[Gabriel Bonnot de Mably|Mably]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]] and [[Cornelius]],{{Disambiguation needed|date=March 2012}} to whom he professed great admiration. He met [[Auguste Comte]] in 1829,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbot&quot;/&gt; becoming his friend until his death.

Amongst many references to him during his lifetime, the work of M. Lemonier stands out. It is entitled Notice Historique,&lt;ref&gt;M. Lemonier&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Historical Record’, and heads the work named Pensées, ‘Thoughts’, of C.J.B. Bonnin. This document was promoted by Bonnin and, maybe, was reviewed by him also. Inside of the French administration files some references to him can be found, like his possible membership to franc-masonry. Also, by these files we know that he spent thirteenth months in prison due to certain passages of his book Études Législatives, ‘Legislative Studies’, where he criticized Catholicism.

The Encyclopedic Magazine or reasoned analysis of the most remarkable productions of France, edition of 1829, highlights the publication of the third edition of the Principles of Public Administration, there is an overview of the most important contents of the work and say it is a book full of wisdom and useful ideas, the author shaped with elegance, accuracy and clarity.

== Legacy ==

Today, because his main work, ‘Principles of Public Administration’,&lt;ref&gt;See Omar Guerrero, www.omarguerrero.org&lt;/ref&gt; has been re-edited and published on-line - in the original French version and in a Spanish translation - is easier to access to it. However, this is mainly thanks to the edition produced by Mexico’s Fondo de Cultura Económica in 2004. Nowadays, his countrymen are paying him the tribute he deserves. Georges Langrod rightly claimed that “the science of administration, in the modern sense of the expression, was born in France in the nineteenth century. Its pioneer was Charles-Jean Bonnin, author of ‘Principles of Public Administration’, whose first edition dates back to 1808. Likewise, Jacques Chevallier and Dániele Loschak have commented that “he can be considered the true founder of French administrative science.” Nevertheless, Charles-Jean Bonnin is more than that, much more: he is the founder of the worldwide science of Public Administration. Most recently, Jacqueline Morand-Devillier suggested a reprint of his ‘Principles’, in its first edition precisely. Notwithstanding, this publication was made in the year 2004, not in France but in Mexico.

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}
An '''émigré''' is a person who has ''emigrated'', often with a connotation of political or social self-[[exile]].  The word is the [[Participle#French|past participle]] of the [[French language|French]] ''émigrer'', &quot;to emigrate&quot;.

Whereas [[emigration|emigrants]] have likely chosen to leave one place and become [[immigration|immigrants]] in a different clime, not usually expecting to return, émigrés see exile as a temporary expedient forced on them by political circumstances{{Original research?|date=December 2015}}. Émigré circles often arouse suspicion as breeding-grounds for plots and counter-revolution{{Quotation needed|date=December 2015}}.

==French Huguenots==
French [[Huguenot]]s were forced to leave France following the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685.

==The American Revolution==

Many [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] that made up large portions of Colonial America, particularly in the South, fled America during and after the American revolution. Common destinations were other parts of the British Empire such as Upper Canada, Nova Scotia, Great Britain, Jamaica, and the British West Indies. The lands left by the fleeing Tories were often awarded by the new government to Patriot soldiers by way of land grants.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Department&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=http://countrystudies.us/united-states/history-33.htm | title=Loyalists During the American Revolution | author=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loyalists&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=http://ncpedia.org/loyalists-part-4-loyalist-fate-wars | title=Loyalists - Part 4: Loyalist Fate at War's End | author=Troxler, Carole Watterson | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The French Revolution==
{{Main article|French Emigration (1789-1815)}}Although the [[French Revolution]] began in 1789 as a peaceful, bourgeois-led effort for increased political equality for the Third Estate, it soon turned into a violent, popular rebellion.  To escape political tensions and save their lives, a number of individuals emigrated from France and settled in the neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Spain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), however quite a few also went to the United States.

==The Russian Revolution==
[[White emigre|White Russian émigrés]] or other opponents of the regime, who fled the [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|Revolution of 1917]] and its aftermath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mjør2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kåre Johan Mjør|title=Reformulating Russia: The Cultural and Intellectual Historiography of Russian First-Wave Émigré Writers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTTxfyp_Z6IC&amp;pg=PA30|date=6 May 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-19286-7|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], in setting out the strategy for future revolutions in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', included the provision that the property of émigrés should be confiscated and used to finance the revolution — a recommendation followed by the Bolsheviks 70 years later.

The October Revolution caused more than 20,000 Russian emigrants to go to [[Finland]], as well as to [[Yugoslavia]] (such as [[Pyotr Wrangel]]). Many of these however moved on to France, [[Paris]] being the favourite destination for Russian émigrés. Many others traveled East to China especially to [[Shanghai]].

==Twentieth century émigrés==
European [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] were forced to leave their native countries due to political upheavals from the beginning of the 20th century to the end of World War II.

==USA==
During 2014, 3415 citizens (who had previously physically left USA) relinquished their US citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Renunciation of citizenship#United States]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is most often attributed to increasingly hostile treatment of US diaspora with extraterritorial laws upon US citizens such as FATCA (2014 HIRE Act){{Quotation needed|date=December 2015}}. (In comparison, there were only 235 expatriations in year 2008).

== South Africa ==
After the historical electoral victory in South Africa by the ANC ([[African National Congress]]) in 1994, a large number of [[Afrikaners]] emigrated from South Africa to other countries, citing discrimination in employment and social violence as reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Peet van Aardt (24 September 2006). &quot;Million whites leave SA - study&quot;. 24.com. Archived from the original on April 16, 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 Australian census there are 145,683 South African émigrés, born in South Africa, in Australia, of whom 30,291 reside in the city of Perth or greater Perth area.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/5GPER?opendocument&amp;navpos=220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exiles==
Unlike ''émigré'', the term ''exile'' remains politically neutral and includes people from whatever side of the political spectrum who had to leave their homeland, often for political reasons, and who wish to return{{Quotation needed|date=December 2015}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2988">The '''&quot;Courrier de Lyon&quot; case''' is a famous French criminal case. It occurred during the [[French Revolution]]. During the night of 27 and 28 April 1796, a mail coach was ambushed outside [[Paris]] (commune of [[Vert-Saint-Denis]]) by several men who stole a large sum of money (7 million [[French livres|livres]]). The stage coach was supposed to go to [[Lyon]] from Paris, carrying money for the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]]. Both the driver and the armed guard were brutally killed. A third man onboard, travelling under an assumed name, participated in the killing and later vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'affaire du &quot;Courrier de Lyon|url=http://www.lodace.net/histoire/impost/courrierdelyon.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following investigations, six men (Etienne Couriol, Charles Guénot, Joseph Richard, Antoine Bruer, David Bernard and Joseph Lesurques) were arrested. After a trial, Couriol, Bernard and Lesurques were executed. Before his execution, however, Couriol claimed that Lesurques was innocent and was only arrested because he resembled André Dubosq, one of the actual attackers of the coach. Couriol's last denunciations also helped arrest other accomplices: Joseph Durochat, who travelled aboard the coach as &quot;Laborde&quot;; Pierre Vidal, who came up with the plan to rob the coach; and Louis Roussy, one of the killers. All of them were convicted and executed. Dubosq was also arrested and executed; however, his trial was not enough to overturn the judgement sentencing Lesurques, for all the witnesses who had recognised Lesurques persisted in saying that they had indeed seen Lesurques and not Dubosq.

Lesurques' family spent most of the 19th century trying to rehabilitate him; but none of the various committees assembled to re-examine the case found sufficient grounds to clear Lesurques' name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaston Delayen, L'Affaire du Courrier de Lyon&quot;&gt;Gaston Delayen, ''L'Affaire du Courrier de Lyon'', 1905, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Lesurques is widely believed to be innocent and this case is remembered in France for being a famous example of [[miscarriage of justice]].

==In popular culture==
The story was turned into two notable plays, a French version by [[Paul Siraudin]] and [[Louis-Mathurin Moreau]] and the 1854 play ''[[The Courier of Lyons]]'' by [[Charles Reade]]. There have been numerous film adaptations of these two works.The case is featured in a 1937 French movie ''L'Affaire du courrier de Lyon''.

Reade's play was turned into a 1916 silent film ''[[The Lyons Mail (1916 film)|The Lyons Mail]]'' and a sound version ''[[The Lyons Mail]]'' in 1931.

:''For the champion racehorse, see'' [[Lit de Justice]].
[[Image:Parlement-Paris-Charles7.jpg|thumb|250px|Lit de justice of king [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] at [[parlement de Paris]], in 1450.]]
In [[France]] under the [[Ancien Régime]], the '''''lit de justice''''' ({{IPA-fr|li də ʒystis}}, &quot;bed of justice&quot;) was a particular formal session of the [[Parlement of Paris]], under the presidency of the king, for the compulsory registration of the royal edicts.  It was named thus because the king would sit on a throne, under a [[baldachin]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Rey, ''Histoire du drapeau, des couleurs et des insignes de la monarchie française'', Vol. 2, Paris 1837, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], not every appearance of the King of France in ''parlement'' occasioned a formal ''lit de justice''.  It was the custom of [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] and his three sons, of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], and of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] to attend sessions of various ''parlements'' regularly.

==Description==
A ''lit de justice'' in Paris was normally held in the ''Grand Chambre du Parlement'' of the royal palace on the [[Île de la Cité]], which remains the ''[[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]]'' even today. The king, fresh from his devotions in [[Sainte-Chapelle]], would enter, accompanied by his chancellor, the ''[[prince du sang|princes du sang]]'', dukes and peers, cardinals and marshals, and take his place upon the cushions on a dais under a canopy of estate (the ''lit'') in a corner of the chamber. 

The records of a ''lit de justice'' of Charles V, May 21, 1375, gives an impression of the panoply of personages: the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], [[Louis I of Anjou|the duc d'Anjou brother of the King]], the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], 4 [[archbishop]]s, 7 [[bishop]]s, 6 [[abbot]]s, the rector and several members of the [[University of Paris]], the Chancellor of France, 4 princes of the blood, several comtes and seigneurs, the [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] of Merchants and the ''echevins'' of the city of Paris, &quot;several other wise and notable folk and a great crowd of people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotelcapitolgrado.it/Francia/Encyclop/LIT%20DE%20JUSTICE.htm ''Encyclopédie'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Five cushions formed the ''lit'': the king sat on one, another formed a back, two more supported his arms and a cushion lay under his feet. Peers and prelates were ranged on benches at his right and left. Before the king, a large space was kept empty, that the king might discuss matters privately. To preserve order, it was forbidden for anyone to leave his seat or approach the ''lit'' without being called.

The king needed only speak a few preliminary words, followed by the formula ''mon chancelier vous dira le reste'' (&quot;my chancellor will tell you the rest&quot;), whereupon the chancellor seated at his feet would read aloud the rest of the royal declaration, such as the declaration of a regency or of a king's majority, or declarations of war or peace. The ''lit de justice'' equally served to cow recalcitrant ''parlements'', imposing the sovereignty of the king.

==Later practice==
In the Middle Ages, a ''lit de justice'' was the setting for trials of great aristocrats for major crimes. In the 16th century, it began to be manipulated for enforcing the registration of royal edicts. In the 17th century, it was rarely used but was revived under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], raising controversy among the parliamentary ''[[noblesse de robe]]'', mindful of their threatened prerogatives.

The ''lit de justice'', as it was revived in 1527, was intended by the royal party as an expression of royal justice, with hazy and immemorial antecedents in the open-air gathering of nobles presided over by enthroned [[Merovingian]] kings. In the king's presence the ''Parlement'' lost its usual quality of judge, to take the role of counsellor following the principle ''adveniente principe, cessat magistratus'' (&quot;with the arrival of the king, magistratures cease&quot;). As relations between Henri III and the Parlement of Paris became strained, the king used his presence in the ''lit de justice'' to enforce his will upon a recalcitrant court.

Absolutist propaganda asserted that a ''lit de justice'' in its origins could take place before any ''parlement'' though, in practice, the appearance of [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] before the [[Parlement|parlement of Rouen]] to enforce the enregistration of his [[Edict of Amboise]] (1563) was an innovation intended to discount the legislative role of the Parlement of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;See Mack P. Holt, &quot;The King in Parlement: The Problem of the Lit de Justice in Sixteenth-Century France&quot; ''The Historical Journal'' '''31'''.3 (September 1988:507-523).&lt;/ref&gt; He and the Queen Mother made a tour of parlements— Dijon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Toulouse— to enforce the registration of the Edict throughout France.&lt;ref&gt;Holt 1988:519&lt;/ref&gt; From the reign of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] it was confined to the ''Parlement de Paris''.

In his ''Memoirs'', the [[Duke of Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]] describes in detail a ''lit de justice'' held during the Regency of the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]] on August 26, 1718 at the [[Tuileries Palace]]. The ''lit ''was used to enact an edict respecting the French currency over ''Parlement's ''objection as well as stripping the [[Duke of Maine]] of his control over the child [[King Louis XV]]'s education and of the rank of ''prince du sang''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3875/3875-h/3875-h.htm The Memoirs of Louis XIV, His Court and the Regency]'' by the Duke of Saint-Simon&lt;/ref&gt;

The last such session was in 1787, under [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The whole body, now ''&quot;refractory, rolled out, in wheeled vehicles, to receive the order of the king.&quot;''

This is a '''glossary of the French Revolution'''. It generally does not explicate names of individual people or their political associations; those can be found in [[List of people associated with the French Revolution]].

The terminology routinely used in discussing the [[French Revolution]] can be confusing, even daunting. The same political faction may be referred to by different historians (or by the same historian in different contexts) by different names. During much of the revolutionary period, the French used a [[French Revolutionary Calendar|newly invented calendar]] that fell into complete disuse after the revolutionary era. Different legislative bodies had rather similar names, not always translated uniformly into [[English language|English]]. This article is intended as a central place to clarify these issues.  For citations see the articles and also Ballard (2011); Furet (1989) Hanson (2004), Ross (1998) and Scott &amp; Rothaus (1985).

==The three estates==
The [[estates of the realm]] in ''[[ancien régime]]'' France were:
*First Estate (''Premièr État'', ''le clergé'' ) – The clergy, both high (generally siding with the nobility, and it often was recruited amongst its younger sons) and low.
*Second Estate (''Second État'', ''la noblesse '') – The nobility. Technically, but not usually of much relevance, the Second Estate also included the Royal Family.
*Third Estate (''Tiers État'')  – Everyone not included in the First or Second Estate. At times this term refers specifically to the [[bourgeoisie]], the middle class, but the Third Estate also included the ''[[sans-culottes]]'', the labouring class. Also included in the Third Estate were lawyers, merchants, and government officials.

''See also:'' [[Fourth Estate]], a term with two relevant meanings: on the one hand, the generally unrepresented poor, nominally part of the Third Estate; on the other, the press, as a fourth powerful entity in addition to the three estates of the realm.

==Social classes==
*[[Royal family|Royalty]] – [[House of Bourbon]], After the [[First French Empire|Empire]] was established.
*[[French nobility|Nobility]] (''noblesse'') – Those with explicit noble title. These are traditionally divided into
**''noblesse d'épée'' (&quot;nobility of the sword&quot;), the hereditary gentry and nobility who originally had to perform military service in exchange for their titles.    
**''noblesse de robe'' (&quot;nobility of the gown&quot;), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government, often referring to those who earned a title of nobility through generations of long periods of public service (bureaucrats and civil servants) or bought it (rich merchants).
**''noblesse de cloche'' (&quot;nobility of the bell&quot;), mayors and aldermen of certain cities under royal charter were considered gentry. Some mayors and aldermen held a noble title for life after a long period of service in office.
**''Noblesse de race'', (&quot;Nobility through breeding&quot;), The &quot;old&quot; nobility, who inherited their titles from time immemorial.
**''Noblesse d’extraction'', Nobility of ''seize-quartiers'' (&quot;sixteen Quarterings&quot;); having pure noble or gentle ancestry for four generations.   
**''Noblesse de lettres'' (&quot;Nobility through letters patent&quot;), The &quot;new&quot; nobility, from after circa 1400 AD.     
*''[[Ci-devant]]'' nobility (literally &quot;from before&quot;): nobility of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' (the Bourbon kingdom) after it had lost its titles and privileges.
*[[Bourgeoisie]] (literally &quot;Suburbanites&quot;) – Roughly, the non-noble wealthy and the middle classes: typically merchants, investors, and professionals such as doctors and lawyers. The dwellers in the small ''bourgs'' (&quot;walled towns and communities&quot;) outside the city. 
*[[Active and passive citizens]] – During the period of the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], approximately half of the men of France were disfranchised as &quot;passive citizens&quot;. Only &quot;active citizens&quot;, a category based on taxes paid, could vote; they also formed the basis of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]].
*''[[Sans-culottes]]'' – literally &quot;those without breeches&quot;, the masses of [[Paris]].
*Peasants, who represent 90 percent of the French nation's population.

==Constitutions==
*Liberal monarchical [[constitution]] – Adopted 6 October, 1789, accepted by the King 14 July, 1790.
*The [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]] or Constitution of 3 September, 1791 – Establishes a limited monarchy and the [[Legislative Assembly]].
*The [[French Constitution of 1793|Constitution of 1793]], Constitution of 24 June, 1793 (''Acte constitutionnel du 24 juin 1793'', or [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] Constitution (''Constitution montagnarde'') – Ratified, but never applied, due to the suspension of all ordinary legality 10 October, 1793.
*The [[Constitution of the Year III]], Constitution of 22 August, 1795, Constitution of the Year III, or Constitution of 5 Fructidor – Establishes the [[French Directory|Directory]].
*The [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] – Adopted 24 December, 1799, establishes the [[French Consulate|Consulate]].
*The [[Constitution of the Year X]] – Establishes a revised Consulate, with Napoleon as First Consul for Life.
*The [[Constitution of the Year XII]] – Establishes Bonaparte's First Empire.

==Governmental structures==
In roughly chronological order:
*The ''[[ancien régime]]'' – The absolute monarchy under the Bourbon kings, generally considered to end some time between the meeting of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] on 5 May, 1789, and the liberal monarchical constitution of 6 October, 1789.
*[[Parlement]]s – Royal Law courts in Paris and most provinces under the ''ancien régime''.
*The [[French States-General|Estates-General]], also known as [[The Estates|States]]-General (''Etats-Généraux'') – The traditional tricameral legislature of the ''ancien régime'', which had fallen into disuse since 1614. The convention of the [[Estates-General of 1789]] is one of the events that led to the French Revolution. The Estates General, as such, met 5–6 May, 1789, but reached an impasse because the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] refused to continue to participate in this structure. The other two estates continued to meet in this form for several more weeks.
*The ''Communes'' – The body formed 11 May, 1789, by the Third Estate after seceding from the Estates General. On 12 June, 1789, the ''Communes'' invited the other orders to join them: some clergy did so the following day.
*The [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] (''Assemblée Nationale'') – Declared 17 June, 1789, by the ''Communes''. The clergy joined them June 19. This was soon reconstituted as...
*The [[National Constituent Assembly]] (''Assemblée nationale constituante''); also loosely referred to as the National Assembly – From 9 July, 1789 to 30 September, 1791, this was both the governing and the constitution–drafting body of [[France]]. It dissolved itself in favour of:
*The [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] (''Assemblée Legislative'') – From 1 October, 1791, to September 1792, the Legislative Assembly, elected by voters with property qualifications, governed France under a [[constitutional monarchy]], but with the removal of the king's veto power on 11 July, 1792, was a republic in all but name, and became even more so after the subsequent arrest of the Royal Family.
*The [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] – During the waning days of the Legislative Assembly and the fall of the Monarchy, the municipal government of Paris functioned, at times, in the capacity of a national government, as a rival, a goad, or a bully to the Legislative Assembly.
**Further, the [[Sections (French Revolution)|Sections]] were directly democratic mass assemblies in Paris during the first four years of the Revolution.
*The Provisional Executive Committee – Headed by [[Georges Danton]], this also functioned in August–September 1792 as a rival claimant to national power.
*The [[National Convention]], or simply The Convention – First met 20 September, 1792; two days later, declared a republic. The National Convention after the fall of the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] (27 July, 1794) is sometimes referred to as the &quot;[[Thermidor]]ian Convention&quot;. Three committees of the National Convention are particularly worthy of note:
**The [[Committee of Public Safety]] (''Comité de salut public'') – During the [[Reign of Terror]], this committee was effectively the government of France. After the fall of the Montagnards, the committee continued, but with reduced powers.
**The [[Committee of General Security]] (''Comité de sûreté générale'') – Coordinated the War effort.
**The [[Committee of Education]] (''Comité de l'instruction'')
**The [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] (''Tribunal révolutionaire'') instituted in March–October 1793 to prosecute all threats to the [[revolutionary republic]], was the effective agent of the ''Comité de Salut Public's'' reign of terror in Paris until its dissolution on 31 May, 1795.
*The [[French Directory|Directory]] (''Directoire'') – From 22 August, 1795, the Convention was replaced by the Directory, a bicameral legislature that more or less institutionalized the dominance of the bourgeoisie while also enacting a major [[land reform]] that was henceforward to place the peasants firmly on the political [[Right-wing politics|right]]. The rightward move was so strong that [[monarchism|monarchist]]s actually won the election of 1797 but were stopped from taking power by the [[coup d'état|coup]] of 18 Fructidor (4 September, 1797), the first time Napoleon played a direct role in government. The Directory continued (politically quite far to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of its earlier self) until Napoleon took power in his own right, 9 November, 1799 (or [[18 Brumaire]]), the date that is generally counted as the end of the French Revolution. The Directory itself was the highest executive organ, comprising five Directors, chosen by the Ancients out of a list elected by the Five Hundred; its legislative was bicameral, consisting of:
**The [[Council of Five Hundred]] (''Conseil des Cinq-Cents''), or simply the Five Hundred.
**The [[Council of Ancients]] (''Conseil des Anciens''), or simply the Ancients or the Senate.
*The [[French Consulate|Consulate]] (''Consulat'') – The period of the Consulate (December 1799 – December 1804) is only ambiguously part of the revolutionary era. The government was led by three individuals known as Consuls. From the start, Napoleon Bonaparte served as First Consul (''Premier Consul'') of the Republic.  In May 1802, a [[plebiscite]] made Bonaparte First Consul for Life. In May 1804 the [[First French Empire|Empire]] was declared, bringing the Revolutionary era to a yet more definitive end.
*The [[tribunat]] was one of the legislative chambers instituted by the Constitution of year VIII, composed of 100 members nominated by the Senate to discuss the legislative initiatives defended by the government's [[Orateur]]s in the presence of the ''[[Corps législatif]]''; abolished in 1807

==Political groupings==
* Royalists or [[Monarchist]]s – Generally refers specifically to supporters of the Bourbon monarchy and can include both supporters of [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. See [[Reactionary]].
* [[Jacobinism|Jacobins]] – strictly, a member of the [[Jacobin club]], but more broadly any revolutionary, particularly the more radical bourgeois elements.
* [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillant]]s – Members of the ''Club des Feuillants'', result of a split within the Jacobins, who favoured a constitutional monarchy over a [[republic]].
* Republicans – Advocates of a system without a monarch.
* The [[Girondist|Gironde]] – Technically, a group of twelve republican deputies more moderate in their tactics than the Montagnards, though arguably many were no less radical in their beliefs; the term is often applied more broadly to others of similar politics. Members and adherents of the Gironde are variously referred to as &quot;Girondists&quot; (''&quot;Girondins&quot;'') or &quot;[[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Brissotins]]&quot;
* [[The Mountain]] (''Montagne'') – The radical republican grouping in power during the [[Reign of Terror]]; its adherents are typically referred to as &quot;Montagnards&quot;.
* ''Septembriseurs'' – The Mountain and others (such as [[Georges Danton]]) who were on the rise in the period of the [[September Massacres]]
* [[Thermidor]]ians or Thermidoreans – The more moderate (some would say reactionary) grouping that came to power after the fall of the Mountain.
* Society of the Panthéon, also known as [[Conspiracy of the Equals]], and as the Secret Directory – faction centered around [[François-Noël Babeuf]], who continued to hold up a radical Jacobin viewpoint during the period of the Thermidorian reaction.
* [[Bonapartist]]s – Supporters of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], especially those who supported his taking on the role of Emperor.
* ''[[Émigré]]s'' – This term usually refers to those conservatives and members of the ''elite'' who left France in the period of increasingly radical revolutionary ascendancy, usually under implied or explicit threat from the Terror. (Generically, it can refer to those who left at other times or for other reasons.) Besides the ''émigrés'' having their property taken by the State, relatives of ''émigrés'' were also persecuted.

==''Ancien régime'' taxes==
*''[[Corvée]]'' – A royal or seigneurial tax, taken in the form of forced labour. It came in many forms, including [[compulsory military service]] and compulsory tillage of fields. Most commonly, the term refers to a royal ''corvée'' requiring peasants to maintain the king's roads.
*''[[Gabelle]]'' – A tax on salt.
*''[[Taille]]'' – A royal tax, in principle pro capita, whose amount was fixed before collecting.
*''[[Tithe]]'' – A tax to church.
*''[[Aide (tax)|Aide]]'' – A tax on wine.
*''[[Vingtième]]'' – 5 percent direct tax levied on income.
*''Capitation'' – A poll tax.

Cockades (''[[cocarde]]s'') were rosettes or ribbons worn as a badge, typically on a hat.

Other countries and armies at this time typically had their own cockades.

The '''Musée de la Révolution française de Vizille''' is a [[departments of France|departmental]] museum on the [[French Revolution]], located in the French town of [[Vizille]], 15 kilometres to the south of [[Grenoble]], on the [[route Napoléon]]. It was set up in 1984 in the [[Château de Vizille]], former home of the dukes of [[Lesdiguières]] (17th century), the Perier family (1782–1895) and the presidents of France (1924–1972) - it also hosted the gathering of three estates of the [[Dauphiné]] on 21 July 1788, known as the [[Assembly of Vizille]]. In 2007 it held a temporary exhibition at the [[Comédie-Française]].

[[File:1799-Cruikshank-Paris-ladies-full-winter-dress-caricature.jpg|thumb|''Paris Ladies in their Winter dress'' (1799). English [[caricature]] by [[George Cruikshank]]]]

The '''Incroyables''' (&quot;incredibles&quot;) and their female counterparts, the '''Merveilleuses''' (&quot;marvelous women&quot;, roughly equivalent to &quot;fabulous divas&quot;), were members of a fashionable aristocratic subculture in Paris during the [[French Directory]] (1795–1799). Whether as catharsis or in a need to reconnect with other survivors of the [[Reign of Terror]], they greeted the new regime with an outbreak of luxury, decadence, and even silliness. They held hundreds of balls and started fashion trends in clothing and mannerisms that today seem exaggerated, affected, or even [[wikt:effete|effete]] (decadent, self-indulgent). Some devotees of the trend preferred to be called &quot;incoyable&quot; or &quot;meveilleuse&quot;, thus avoiding the letter R, as in &quot;révolution.&quot; When this period ended, society took a more sober and modest turn.

Members of the ruling classes were also among the movement's leading figures, and the group heavily influenced the politics, clothing, and arts of the period.  They emerged from the ''[[muscadin]]s'', a term for dandyish anti-[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] street gangs in Paris from 1793 {{refn|Jacobins stood for the centralised supposed far-left republic and its terrors, so included established rulers such as Robespierre|group= n}} who were important politically for some two years; the terms are often used interchangeably, though the muscadins were of a lower social background, being largely middle-class.

==Social background==
[[File:Thérésa Cabarrus.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Thérésa Tallien]], a leading ''Merveilleuse'', in [[Neoclassicism#Neoclassicism_and_fashion|Neoclassical style]]]]

Ornate carriages reappeared on the streets of Paris the day after the execution (28 July 1794) of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], which brought an end to the Jacobin-era [[Committee of Public Safety]] and signaled the commencement of the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. There were masters and servants once more in Paris, and the city erupted in a furor of pleasure-seeking and entertainment. Theaters thrived, and popular music satirized the excesses of the Revolution. One popular song of the period called on the French people to &quot;share my horror&quot; and to send &quot;these drinkers of human blood&quot; back amongst the monsters from which they had sprung. Its lyrics rejoiced that &quot;your tormentors finally grow pale at the tardy dawn of vengeance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
''Le Reveil du peuple'', &quot;The Awakening of the People'&quot;, written by Jean-Marie Souriguières de St Marc and set to music by [[Pierre Gaveaux]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Passez Payez.jpg|thumbnail|Passez Payez]]

Many public balls were ''[[bals des victimes]]'' at which young aristocrats who had lost loved ones to the [[guillotine]] danced in mourning dress or wore black armbands, greeting one another with violent movements of the head as if in decapitation.{{refn|Romantic horror had already come to the fore in [[gothic fiction]], beginning with ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764); however, this theme expanded: [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (1809-1849), [[Mary Shelley]] (1797-1851), gothic novels and other-language equivalents such as the German ''Schauerroman'' and the French ''roman noir'' would all soon follow after this period.|group= n}} A ball held at the [[Hôtel Thellusson]] on the [[rue de Provence]] in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]] restricted its guest list to the grown children of the guillotined.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Rustenholz, ''Les traversées de Paris'', Parigramme, September 2006, Evreux, ISBN 2-84096-400-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothing and fashion==
[[File:Cafe des Incroyables.jpg|thumbnail|Cafe des Incroyables]]

The Merveilleuses scandalized Paris with dresses and tunics modeled after the ancient Greeks and Romans, cut of light or even transparent linen and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed &quot;woven air&quot;, many gowns displayed [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as [[reticule (handbag)|reticule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austentation.com/history/reticule.html|title=Reticule|work=Austentation: Regency Accessories|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the rage. The sandals tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like [[Parfums Lubin]] were worn as both for style and as indicators of social station. [[Thérésa Tallien]], known as &quot;Our Lady of Thermidor&quot;, wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs.

The Incroyables wore eccentric outfits: large earrings, green jackets, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick glasses, and hats topped by &quot;dog ears&quot;, their hair falling on their ears. Their [[musk]]-based fragrances earned them too the derogatory nickname ''muscadins'' among the lower classes, already applied to a wide group of anti-jacobins. They wore [[bicorne]] hats and carried bludgeons, which they referred to as their &quot;executive power.&quot; Hair was often shoulder-length, sometimes pulled up in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the condemned. Some sported large monocles, and they frequently affected a lisp and sometimes a stooped hunchbacked posture.

In addition to Madame Tallien, famous Merveilleuses included [[Anne Françoise Elizabeth Lange]], [[Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier]], and two very popular [[Creole peoples|Créoles]]: Fortunée Hamelin and [[Hortense de Beauharnais]]. Hortense, a daughter of the [[Empress Josephine]], married [[Louis Bonaparte]] and became the mother of [[Napoleon III]]. Fortunée was not born rich, but she became famous for her [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] and her string of prominent lovers. Parisian society compared [[Germaine de Staël]] and Mme Raguet to [[Minerva]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and named their garments for Roman deities: gowns were styled [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] or [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and tunics were styled ''à la'' [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] or Minerva.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Richard Allinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJeAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA190-IA1&amp;ots=MQ89Tsbt3G&amp;dq=mme%20raguet%20directoire&amp;pg=PA190-IA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Days of the Directoire''], J. Lane, (1910), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading Incroyable, [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras]], was one of five directors who ran the Republic of France and gave the period its name. He hosted luxurious feasts attended by [[Monarchism|royalists]], repentant [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], ladies, and courtesans. Since divorce was now legal, sexuality was looser than in the past. However, de Barras' reputation for immorality may have been a factor in his later overthrow, a [[coup]] that brought the [[French Consulate]] to power and paved the way for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].

==Representation in the arts==
[[File:charles-vernet-top-hat.jpg|thumb|right|Painting &quot;Un Incroyable&quot;, by [[Carle Vernet]], perhaps the first image of a [[top hat]] (1796)]]
[[File:Directoire fashion caricature 1797.jpg|thumb||French caricature of ''Merveilleuse'' transparent dresses]]
The fictional ''nouveau riche'' social climber Madame Angot, awkwardly wearing ridiculous Greek clothing, parodied the Merveilleuses in many plays of the period. Carl Vernet's [[caricature]]s of the wardrobes of the Incroyables and Merveilleuses met with contemporary popular success.

Canadian [[webcomic]] artist [[Kate Beaton]] has created similar caricatures, which featured in her comic ''Hark! a Vagrant'', comparing the Merveilleuses to the modern-day [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=229|title=Hipsters Ruin Everything, Part 2|last=Beaton|first=Kate|work=Hark!

The '''National Guard''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|la '''Garde nationale'''}}) was originally a French [[militia]] which existed from 1789 until 1872, including a period of official disbandment from 1827 to 1830. It was separate from the [[French Army]] and existed both for policing and as a military reserve. For most of its history the National Guard, particularly its officers, were widely viewed as loyal to middle-class interests. However, from 1792 to 1795, the National Guard was perceived as revolutionary and the lower ranks were identified with [[sans-culotte]]s, and soon after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-71, the National Guard in Paris became viewed as dangerously revolutionary, contributing to its dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thelocal.fr/20160728/france-to-form-national-guard-to-protect-citizens | title=France to create new National Guard 'to protect its citizens' | publisher=Local.fr | accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
[[File:Monsieur Hepp-Jean-Daniel Heimlich f4651969.jpg|thumb|upright|Mssr. Hepp, commander of the National Guard of Strasbourg in 1790]]

The raising of a &quot;Bourgeois Guard&quot; (''&quot;garde bourgeoise&quot;'') for Paris was discussed by the National Assembly on 11 July 1789 in response to the King's sudden and alarming replacement of prime minister [[Jacques Necker]] with the [[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|Baron de Breteuil]] on that day. This had rapidly spread anger and violence throughout Paris. The National Assembly declared the formation of a &quot;Bourgeois Militia&quot; (''&quot;milice bourgeoise&quot;'') on 13 July. In the early morning of the next day, the search for weapons for this new militia led to the storming of the [[Hotel des Invalides]] and then the [[storming of the Bastille]].

[[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] was elected to the post of commander in chief of the Bourgeois Militia on 15 July, and it was renamed the &quot;National Guard&quot;. Similar bodies were spontaneously created in the towns and rural districts of France in response to widespread fears of chaos or counter-revolution. When the [[French Guards]] mutinied and were disbanded during the same month, the majority of this former royal regiment's rank and file became the full-time cadre of the Paris National Guard.

Initially each city, town and village maintained its own National Guard, until they were united on 14 July 1790 under Lafayette, who was appointed &quot;Commandant General of all the National Guards of the Kingdom&quot;.

==Organization==

{{See also|Constitutional Guard}}

The officers of the National Guard were elected. Under the law of 14 October 1791, all [[active citizen]]s and their children over 18 years were obliged to join the National Guard. Their role was the maintenance of law and order and, if necessary, the defence of the territory. Following a nationwide scheme decided on in September 1791, the National Guard was organised on the basis of district or canton companies. Five of these neighbourhood units (designated as fusiliers or grenadiers) made up a battalion. Eight to ten battalions comprised a ''legion''. Districts might also provide companies of veterans and young citizens, respectively drawn from volunteers of over 60 or under 18. Where possible, there was provision for mounted detachments and artillerymen.{{sfn|Crowdy|2004|p=14}}

The citizens kept their weapons and their uniforms at home, and set forth with them when required. The initially multi-coloured uniforms of the various provincial National Guard units were standardised in 1791, using as a model the dark blue coats with red collars, white lapels and cuffs worn by the Paris National Guard since its creation.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Haythornthwaite, page 87 &quot;Uniforms of the French Revolutionary Wars, ISBN 0 7137 0936 7&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of colours matched those of the revolutionary tricolour.

==Role during the Revolution==
[[File:Révolte Fouesnant.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Soldiers of the ''Garde nationale'' of [[Quimper]] escorting royalist rebels in [[Brittany]] (1792). Painting by [[Jules Girardet]].]]

The former '''Guet royal'''` had held responsibility for the maintenance of law and order in Paris from 1254 to 1791, when the National Guard took over this role. In fact, the last commander of the Guet royal (''Chevalier du Guet''), de La Rothière, was elected to head the National Guard in 1791. In the summer of 1792, the fundamental character of the guard changed. The ''[[fédéré]]s'' were admitted to the guard and the subsequent takeover of the guard by [[Antoine Joseph Santerre]] when Mandat was murdered in the first hours of the [[10th of August (French Revolution)|insurrection of 10 August]] placed a radical revolutionary at the head of the Guard. After the abolition of the monarchy (21 September 1792), the National Guard fought for the Revolution and it had an important role in forcing the wishes of the capital on the [[French National Assembly]] which was obliged to give way in front of the force of the &quot;patriotic&quot; bayonets.

After [[9 Thermidor]], year II (27 July 1794), the new government of the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] placed the National Guard under the control of more conservative leadership. Part of the National Guard then attempted to overthrow the [[French Directory|Directory]] during the royalist insurrection on the 13 Vendémiaire, year IV (5 October 1795), but were defeated by forces led by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the [[13 Vendémiaire|Battle of 13 Vendémiaire]]. The Paris National Guard thereafter ceased to play a significant political role.

==First Empire==
[[File:Horace Vernet - La Barrière de Clichy.jpg|thumb|The national Guard of Paris at the [[Battle of Paris (1814)|Battle of Paris]], 1814]]
Napoleon did not believe that the middle-class National Guard would be able to maintain order and suppress riots. Therefore, he created a ''Municipal Guard of Paris'', a full-time [[gendarmerie]] which was strongly militarised. However, he did not abolish the National Guard, but was content to partially disarm it. He kept the force in reserve and mobilised it for the defence of French territory in 1809 and 1814. In Paris during this period the National Guard comprised twelve thousand bourgeois property owners, serving part-time and equipped at their own expense, whose prime function was to guard public buildings on a roster basis.{{sfn|Mansel|2003|p=4}} Between 1811 and 1812 the National Guard, was organized in &quot;cohorts&quot; to distinguish it from the regular army, and for home defence ''only''. By a skilful appeal to patriotism, and judicious pressure applied through the [[Prefect (France)|prefects]], it became a useful reservoir of half-trained men for new battalions of the active army.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation-attribution|{{harvnb|Maude|1911|p=229}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invasion of France by allied Austrian, Prussian, Russian and British armies in 1814, the National Guard was suddenly called on to provide support for regular Imperial forces. Existing National Guard units, such as those of Paris, were deployed as defence corps in their areas of recruitment. Mass conscription was extended to age groups previously exempt from military service, to provide more manpower for the expanded National Guard. Students and volunteers from gamekeepers and other professional groups formed separate units within the National Guard. Clothing and equipment was often in short supply and even the Paris National Guard was obliged to provide pikes as substitute weapons for some of its new recruits.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Hourtouille, page 127 &quot;1814 The Campaign for France&quot;, ISBN 2-915239-56-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Six thousand national guardsmen took part in the [[Battle of Paris (1814)|Battle of Paris]] in 1814. Following the occupation of the city by the allied armies, the National Guard was expanded to 35,000 men and became the primary force for maintaining order.{{sfn|Mansel|2003|p=13}}

==The Restoration==
Under the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] in 1814, the National Guard was maintained by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. Initially the Guard, purged of its Napoleonic leadership, maintained good relations with the restored monarchy. The future [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] served as its Colonel-General, reviewed the force regularly and intervened to veto its proposed disbandment on the grounds of economy by the ''Conseil Municipal'' of Paris.{{sfn|Mansel|2003|p=217}} However, by 1827, the middle-class men who still composed the Guard had come to feel a degree of hostility towards the reactionary monarchy. Following hostile cries at a review on 29 April Charles X dissolved the Guard the following day, on the grounds of offensive behaviour towards the crown.{{sfn|Mansel|2003|p=218}} He neglected to disarm the disbanded force, and its muskets resurfaced in 1830 during the [[July Revolution]].

==National Guard following 1831==
[[File:Une compagnie de la 2e legion sur les champs de mars.jpg|thumb|A company of the 2nd Legion of the National Guard on the [[Champ de Mars]] in Paris (1836).]]
[[File:French Garde Nationale soldier with Tabatiere rifle 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|French Garde Nationale soldier with [[Tabatière rifle]], 1870.]]
A new National Guard was established in 1831 following the July Revolution in 1830. It played a major role in suppressing the Paris [[June Rebellion]] of 1832 against the government of King [[Louis-Phillipe]]. However, the same National Guard fought in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolution of 1848]] in favour of the republicans. This change in allegiance reflected a general erosion in the popularity of Louis-Phillipe and his &quot;Bourgeois Monarchy&quot;, rather than any fundamental change in the make up of the National Guard, which remained a middle-class body.

==Second Empire==
[[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] confined the National Guard during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] to subordinate tasks to reduce its liberal and republican influence. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] the [[Government of National Defense]] of 1870 called on the Guard to undertake a major role in defending Paris against the invading [[Prussia]]n army. During the uprising of the [[Paris Commune]], from March to May 1871, the National Guard in Paris was expanded to include all able-bodied citizens capable of carrying weapons. Following the Commune's defeat by the regular French Army, the National Guard was offically abolished and its units disbanded. Also disbanded was the [[Garde Mobile|Mobile National Guard]] (''Garde Nationale Mobile'') raised in 1866 to provide personnel and officers for rapid deployment operations nationwide, as well as to provide reserve personnel for the armed forces.

==End of the National Guard==
Despite its major role in the Franco-Prussian War, the National Guard was disbanded soon after the establishment of the Third Republic. Having been converted from a volunteer reserve into a much larger force composed mainly of conscripts, the National Guard had lost its identity and ''raison d'être''. It also faced opposition from the army which was opposed to such a large armed force outside its direct control. The role of the Paris units of the National Guard in the uprising of the [[Paris Commune]] led to a great degree of hostility towards the National Guard, especially from the army.

Perceived as an embodiment of the revolutionary republican &quot;nation in arms&quot; at the time of the Revolution of 1789, the National Guard was formally disbanded on 14 March 1872 as a threat to the security and order of the new [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].

The National Guard was superseded by the creation of territorial regiments, made up of older men who had completed their period of full-time military service. These reserve units were embodied only in times of general mobilisation but remained an integral part of the regular army.

==Recreation of the National Guard==
After wave of terror attacks in France, which intensified significantly starting in 2014 and 2015, French President [[François Hollande]] declared the total establishment of a new National Guard. By his words, the Guard will be formed using military reserve forces. Hollande expected to start parliamentary consultations on September 2016 about this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.france24.com/en/20160728-hollande-france-form-national-guard-counter-terrorism-threat | title=France to form National Guard to counter terrorist threat, Hollande says | publisher=France 24 | accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2016, during a weekly meeting of the Cabinet, the National Guard was officially reconstituted after 145 years as the fifth service branch of the [[French Armed Forces]] under the [[French Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/france-creates-national-guard-to-battle-terrorism France creates National Guard to battle terrorism]&lt;/ref&gt; The revitalized Guard will also reinforce elements of the [[National Gendarmerie]] and the [[National Police (France)|National Police]] in securing major events nationwide while performing its historical responsibility as a national military and police reserve service.

It is expected that the new Guard will grow to a 72,500-member force in 2017 and grow to a 86,000-member national reserve in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2016/10/12/la-garde-nationale-nouveau-label-des-reserves-operationnelles_5012062_3224.html ''La « garde nationale », un vivier de 72 000 réservistes en 2017'', Le Monde, October 12, 2016 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2016/10/27/garde-nationale-la-generation-charlie-hebdo_5021169_3224.html ''Garde nationale, la génération « Charlie Hebdo »'', Le Monde, October 27, 2016 issue]&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the revived Guard will be assisted with a dedicated 311 million euro budget and its personnel will now come from the reserves, members from the private sector and active personnel seconded to the service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3850">'''Jean-Baptiste Mailhe''' (2 June 1750, [[Guizerix]] - 1 June 1834, [[Paris]]) was a politician during the [[French Revolution]]. He gave his name to &quot;&quot;the Mailhe amendment&quot;, which sought to delay the execution of [[Louis XVI]].

==Biography==
The son of a landowner, he became a lawyer in [[Toulouse]].

Elected to the Legislature in 1791, he was part of the Diplomatic Committee and sat alongside the [[Girondins]], who supported the policy of war against [[Austria]].

Re-elected in September 1792 as Member of Parliament for the [[Haute-Garonne]] in the [[National Convention]], he sat with [[The Plain|La Plaine]], remaining close to the Girondists.&lt;ref name=&quot;naf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche.asp?num_dept=13134|title=Jean-Baptiste Mailhe biography at the official National Assembly of France website|accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Trial of Louis XVI===
{{main article|Trial of Louis XVI}}
Mailhe led the committee to decide whether King Louis XVI could be tried despite the [[constitution]] stating that the king was inviolable. Mailhe's report concluded that constitutional inviolability was a gift of the people, and so could be revoked by them. Thus King Louis XVI could indeed be tried by the National Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Arkansas Academy of Science Proceedings|volume=20|year=1966|url=http://libinfo.uark.edu/aas/issues/1966v20/v20a18.pdf|title=The inviolability controversy in the trial of Louis XVI|author=Ronald L. Hayworth|pages=111–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;DPJ&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The king's trial:the French Revolution vs. Louis XVI|last=Jordan|first=David P.|publisher=University of California Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sigPXBq4IEC&amp;dq=Jean-Baptiste+Mailhe&amp;jtp=64|date=November 1979|pages=64–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the trial of the king, he proposed  &quot;Death, but [...] I think it would be worthy of the Convention to consider whether it would be useful to policy to delay the execution&quot; which was supported by twenty-six MPs. This &quot;Mailhe amendment&quot; was regarded by some of Mailhe's contemporaries as a conspiracy to save the king's life. It was even suggested that Mailhe had been paid, perhaps by Spanish gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;DPJ&quot; /&gt; In the final vote, twenty three MPs voted for death invoking the condition of the Mailhe amendment.

===1793 - 1834===
[[Days of 31 May and 2 June 1793|On 2 June 1793, Paris sections took over the Convention]], calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral franchise to [[sans-culottes]] (working class radicals) alone. With the backing of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], they persuaded the Convention to arrest 31 Girondist leaders. After that, Mailhe confined himself to the Legislation Committee, not reappearing in the National Convention until several weeks after the fall of [[Robespierre]] in July 1794.

Mailhe was elected to the [[council of the Five Hundred]] (the lower house) in 1795. After that he became a journalist, editor of the ''Journal General de France'', a publication with a royalist slant. He was banished after the [[coup of 18 Fructidor]] (1797). The consular government recalled him after a year and he became a lawyer in Paris. At the [[French Restoration|Restoration of the monarchy]], and the 1816 Act against the regicides, he was forced to leave the country again. He went to [[Brussels]], where he continued to practise law, returning to France after the revolution of 1830.&lt;ref name=&quot;naf&quot; /&gt;

The '''Napoleonic era''' is a period in the [[history of France]] and [[history of Europe|Europe]]. It is generally classified as including the fourth and final stage of the [[French Revolution]], the first being the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the second being the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and the third being the [[French Directory|Directory]]. The Napoleonic era begins roughly with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s ''[[18 Brumaire|coup d'état]]'', overthrowing the Directory, establishing the [[French Consulate]], and ends during the [[Hundred Days]] and his defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (9 November 1799&amp;nbsp;– 28 June 1815). The [[Congress of Vienna]] soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French Revolution days. Napoleon brought political stability to a land torn by revolution and war. He made peace with the Roman Catholic Church and reversed the most radical religious policies of the Convention. In 1804 Napoleon promulgated the [[Civil Code]], a revised body of civil law, which also helped stabilize French society. The Civil Code affirmed the political and legal equality of all adult men and established a merit-based society in which individuals advanced in education and employment because of talent rather than birth or social standing. The Civil Code confirmed many of the moderate revolutionary policies of the National Assembly but retracted measures passed by the more radical Convention. The code restored patriarchal authority in the family, for example, by making women and children subservient to male heads of households.

Whilst working to stabilise France, Napoleon also sought to extend his authority throughout Europe. Napoleon's armies conquered the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, occupied lands, and he forced Austria, Prussia, and Russia to ally with him and respect French hegemony in Europe. The United Kingdom refused to recognise French hegemony and continued the war throughout.

The [[First French Empire]] began to unravel in 1812, when he decided to [[French invasion of Russia|invade Russia]]. Napoleon underestimated the difficulties his army would have to face whilst occupying Russia. Convinced that the Tsar was conspiring with his British enemies, Napoleon led an army of 600,000 soldiers to Moscow. He defeated the Russian army at Borodino before capturing Moscow, but the Tsar withdrew and Moscow was set ablaze, leaving Napoleon's vast army without adequate shelter or supplies. Napoleon ordered a retreat, but the bitter [[Russian winter]]  and repeated Russian attacks whittled down his army, and only a battered remnant of 30,000 soldiers managed to limp back to French territory. The allies then continued a united effort against Napoleon until they had seized Paris forcing his abdication in 1814. His return to power the next year was resisted by all the allies and his army was defeated by an Anglo-Allied force at Waterloo.

{{History of France}}
{{Revolution sidebar}}
The '''French Revolution''' ({{lang-fr|Révolution française}} {{IPA-fr|ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz|}}) was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in [[France]] that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward by [[Napoleon]] during the later expansion of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of [[modern history]], triggering the global decline of [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] while replacing them with [[republics]] and [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]].&lt;ref&gt;Livesey, James. ''Making Democracy in the French Revolution'' p. 19 ''The Revolution created and elaborated...the ideal of democracy, which forms the creative tension with the notion of sovereignty that informs the functioning of modern democratic liberal states. This was the truly original contribution of the Revolution to modern political culture.''&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary Wars]], it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] to the [[Middle East]]. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in [[human history]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Linda S 2004&quot;&gt;Linda S. Frey and Marsha L. Frey, ''The French Revolution'' (2004), Foreword.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joel Colton 1978 p. 341&quot;&gt;R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton, ''A History of the Modern World'' (5th ed. 1978), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferenc Fehér 1990 pp. 117-30&quot;&gt;Ferenc Fehér, ''The French Revolution and the Birth of Modernity'', (1990) pp. 117–30&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[causes of the French Revolution]] are complex and are still debated among historians. Following the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]],&lt;ref&gt;Tombs, Robert and Isabelle. ''That Sweet Enemy: The French and the British from the Sun King to the Present''. Random House (2007) ISBN 978-1-4000-4024-7. p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; the French government was deeply in debt and attempted to restore its financial status through unpopular taxation schemes. Years of bad harvests leading up to the Revolution also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and the aristocracy. Demands for change were formulated in terms of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals and contributed to the convocation of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] in May 1789. The first year of the Revolution saw members of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] taking control, the [[Storming of the Bastille|assault on the Bastille]] in July, the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August, and a [[The Women's March on Versailles|women's march on Versailles]] that forced the royal court back to Paris in October. A central event of the first stage, in August 1789, was the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]] and the old rules and privileges left over from the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. The next few years featured political struggles between various [[Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly|liberal assemblies]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. France rapidly transformed into a democratic and secular society with [[freedom of religion]], legalisation of [[divorce]], decriminalisation of [[same-sex relationships]], and [[civil rights]] for [[Jews]] and [[black people]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Lynn. ''The French Revolution and Human Rights'', St. Martin's Press, 1996, pp. 7–12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First French Republic|Republic]] was proclaimed in September 1792 after the French [[Battle of Valmy|victory at Valmy]]. In a momentous event that led to international condemnation, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was [[Execution of Louis XVI|executed]] in January 1793.

External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured [[Military history of France|French victories]] that facilitated the conquest of the [[Italian Peninsula]], the [[Low Countries]] and most territories west of the [[Rhine]] – achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]]. The dictatorship imposed by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] during the [[Reign of Terror]], from 1793 until 1794, established [[General maximum|price controls on food]] and other items, abolished slavery in French colonies abroad, [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|dechristianised society]] through the creation of a [[French Republican Calendar|new calendar]] and the expulsion of religious figures, and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies. Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror, with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;Matusitz, Jonathan ''Symbolism in Terrorism: Motivation, Communication, and Behavior'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], an executive council known as the [[French Directory|Directory]] assumed control of the French state in 1795. The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections, debt repudiations, financial instability, persecutions against the Catholic clergy, and significant military conquests abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, R.R. &amp; Colton, Joel ''A History of the Modern World'' pp. 393–97&lt;/ref&gt; Dogged by charges of corruption, the Directory [[coup of 18 Brumaire|collapsed in a coup]] led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. Napoleon, who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns, went on to establish the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and later the First Empire, setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

The modern era has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. Almost all future revolutionary movements looked back to the Revolution as their predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, R.R. &amp; Colton, Joel ''A History of the Modern World'' p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Its central phrases and cultural symbols, such as ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and ''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]'', became the clarion call for other major upheavals in modern history, including the [[Russian Revolution]] over a century later.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Shlapentokh, ''The French Revolution and the Russian Anti-Democratic Tradition'' (Edison, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1997), pp. 220–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The values and institutions of the Revolution dominate French politics to this day. The Revolution resulted in the suppression of the feudal system, the emancipation of the individual, the greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth and the establishment of equality. The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Aulard in Arthur Tilley, ed.|title= Modern France. A Companion to French Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c45AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=1922|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, the Revolution accelerated the rise of republics and democracies. It became the focal point for the development of all modern political ideologies, leading to the spread of [[liberalism]], [[Political radicalism|radicalism]], [[nationalism]], [[socialism]], [[feminism]], and [[secularism]], among many others. The Revolution also witnessed the birth of [[total war]] by organising the resources of France and the lives of its citizens towards the objective of military conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the birth of warfare as we know it |last=Bell|first=David Avrom |year=2007 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=New York |isbn=0-618-34965-0 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its central documents, like the Declaration of the Rights of Man, expanded the arena of [[human rights]] to include women and slaves, leading to movements for [[abolitionism]] and [[universal suffrage]] in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Desan et al. eds. ''The French Revolution in Global Perspective'' (2013) , pp. 3, 8, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the 18th century, there emerged what the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] called the idea of the &quot;[[public sphere]]&quot; in France and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanning, T.C.W page 26&quot;&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argued that the dominant cultural model in 17th century France was a &quot;representational&quot; culture, which was based on a one-sided need to &quot;represent&quot; power with one side active and the other passive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanning, T.C.W page 26&quot;/&gt; A perfect example would be the Palace of Versailles which was meant to overwhelm the senses of the visitor and convince one of the greatness of the French state and Louis XIV.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanning, T.C.W page 26&quot;/&gt; Starting in the early 18th century saw the appearance of the &quot;public sphere&quot; which was &quot;critical&quot; in that both sides were active.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the &quot;public sphere&quot; included newspapers, journals, masonic lodges, coffee houses and reading clubs where people either in person or virtually via the printed word debated and discussed issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanning, T.C.W page 27&quot;&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the emergence of the &quot;public sphere&quot; outside of the control of the state saw the shift from Versailles to Paris as the cultural capital of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanning, T.C.W page 27&quot;/&gt; Likewise, in the 17th century it was the court that decided what was culturally good and what was not; in the 18th century, the opinion of the court mattered less and it was the consumers who become the arbiters of cultural taste.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1750s, during the ''&quot;querelle des bouffons&quot;'' over the question of the quality of Italian vs. French music, the partisans of both sides appealed to the French public &quot;because it alone has the right to decide whether a work will be preserved for posterity or will be used by grocers as wrapping-paper&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1782, Louis-Sébastien Mercier wrote: &quot;The word court no longer inspires awe amongst us as in the time of Louis XIV. Reigning opinions are no longer received from the court; it no longer decides on reputations of any sort ... The court's judgments are countermanded; one says openly that it understands nothing; it has no ideas on the subject and could have none.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Inevitably, the belief that public opinion had the right to decide cultural questions instead of deferring to the court transformed itself into the demand that public also have a say on political questions as well.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. ''The French Revolution: Class War or Culture Clash?'', London: Macmillan, 1998 pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy in the Ancien Régime during the years preceding the Revolution suffered from instability; poor harvests lasting several years and an inadequate transportation system both contributed to making food more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, Louise A. &quot;Food entitlement, famine, and conflict&quot;.

''Journal of interdisciplinary history'' (1983): 303–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of events leading to the Revolution included the national government's fiscal troubles caused by an inefficient tax system and expenditure on numerous large wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;macroeconomics&quot; /&gt; The attempt to challenge British naval and commercial power in the [[Seven Years' War]] was a costly disaster, with the loss of [[New France|France's colonial possessions in continental North America]] and the destruction of the French Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, William S.

Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; French forces were rebuilt and performed more successfully in the [[American Revolutionary War]], but only at massive additional cost, and with no real gains for France except the knowledge that Britain had been humbled.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} France's inefficient and antiquated financial system could not finance this debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle&quot; /&gt; Faced with a financial crisis, the king called an Estates General, recommended by the [[Assembly of Notables]] in 1787 for the first time in over a century.&lt;ref&gt;De Tocqueville, Alexis, François Furet, and Françoise Mélonio. The Old Regime and the Revolution, Volume II: Notes on the French Revolution and Napoleon. Vol. 2. University of Chicago Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the royal court at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] was isolated from and indifferent to the escalating crisis. While in theory [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] was an absolute monarch, in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition. While he did reduce government expenditures, opponents in the ''[[parliament]]s'' successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had produced many writers, pamphleteers and publishers who could inform or inflame public opinion. The opposition used this resource to mobilise public opinion against the monarchy, which in turn tried to repress the underground literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle&quot;&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (2nd ed. 2003), pp. 45–49, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other factors involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of Enlightenment ideals. These included resentment of royal [[political absolutism|absolutism]]; resentment by peasants, labourers and the [[bourgeoisie]] towards the traditional [[manorialism|seigneurial]] privileges possessed by the nobility; resentment of the Catholic Church's influence over public policy and institutions; aspirations for [[freedom of religion]]; resentment of aristocratic bishops by the poorer rural clergy; aspirations for social, political and economic equality, and (especially as the Revolution progressed) [[republicanism]]; hatred of Queen [[Marie-Antoinette]], who was falsely accused of being a spendthrift and an [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] spy; and anger towards the King for dismissing ministers, including finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], who were popularly seen as representatives of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (2003), pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freemasonry]] played an important role in the revolution. Originally largely apolitical, Freemasonry was radicalised in the late 18th century through the introduction of higher grades which emphasised themes of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Virtually every major player in the Revolution was a Freemason and these themes became the widely recognised slogan of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Henri.

==Ancien Régime==

===Financial crisis===
[[File:Troisordres.jpg|thumb|Caricature of the Third Estate carrying the First Estate (clergy) and the Second Estate (nobility) on its back.]]
[[Louis XVI]] ascended to the throne in the middle of a [[financial crisis]] in which the state was faced with a budget deficit and was nearing bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Frey, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This was due in part to France's costly involvements in the [[Seven Years' War]] and later the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section1.html|title=France's Financial Crisis: 1783–1788|accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1776, finance minister [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms. The next year, [[Jacques Necker]], a foreigner, was appointed [[Comptroller]]-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hib35&quot;&gt;Hibbert, pp. 35, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Necker realised that the country's extremely [[regressive tax]] system subjected the lower classes to a heavy burden,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hib35&quot;/&gt; while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frey2&quot;&gt;Frey, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the country could not be taxed higher; that tax exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced; and proposed that borrowing more money would solve the country's fiscal shortages. Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36&amp;nbsp;million [[French livre|livres]], and proposed restricting the power of the ''[[parlement]]s''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hib35&quot;/&gt;

This was not received well by the King's ministers, and Necker, hoping to bolster his position, argued to be made a minister. The King refused, Necker was dismissed, and [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]] was appointed to the Comptrollership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hib35&quot;/&gt; Calonne initially spent liberally, but he quickly realised the critical financial situation and proposed a new [[tax code]].&lt;ref name=&quot;D34&quot;&gt;Doyle, ''The French Revolution: A very short introduction'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal included a consistent [[Land value tax|land tax]], which would include taxation of the nobility and clergy. Faced with opposition from the parlements, Calonne organised the summoning of the [[Assembly of Notables]]. But the Assembly failed to endorse Calonne's proposals and instead weakened his position through its criticism. In response, the King announced the calling of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General for May 1789]], the first time the body had been summoned since 1614. This was a signal that the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon monarchy]] was in a weakened state and subject to the demands of its people.&lt;ref name=&quot;D36&quot;&gt;Doyle 2003, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estates-General of 1789===
{{Main article|Estates-General of 1789}}
The Estates-General was organised into three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the rest of France. It had last met in 1614. Elections were held in the spring of 1789; suffrage requirements for the Third Estate were for French-born or naturalised males, aged 25 years or more, who resided where the vote was to take place and who paid taxes. Strong turnout produced 1,201 delegates, including 303 clergy, 291 nobles and 610 members of the Third Estate. The First Estate represented 100,000 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10% of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) on peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, '' The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Estate represented the nobility, about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25% of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of these deputies were nobles, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was doubled to 610 men, representing 95% of the population. Half were well educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, '' The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''The French Revolution 1787–1799'' (1975) pp. 127–29.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|right|The meeting of the Estates General on 5 May 1789 at Versailles.]]
To assist delegates, &quot;Books of grievances&quot; (''cahiers de doléances'') were compiled to list problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frey 4&quot;&gt;Frey, pp. 4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The books articulated ideas which would have seemed radical only months before; however, most supported the monarchical system in general. Many assumed the Estates-General would approve future taxes, and Enlightenment ideals were relatively rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;D38&quot;&gt;Doyle 2001, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neely35&quot;&gt;Neely, pp. 63, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Pamphlets by liberal nobles and clergy became widespread after the lifting of press censorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neely 56&quot;&gt;Neely, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abbé Sieyès]], a theorist and Catholic clergyman, argued the paramount importance of the Third Estate in the pamphlet ''Qu'est-ce que le tiers état?'' (''[[What is the Third Estate?]]'') published in January, 1789. He asserted: &quot;What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been until now in the political order? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;D38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furet, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estates-General convened in the Grands Salles des Menus-Plaisirs in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] on 5 May 1789 and opened with a three-hour speech by Necker. The Third Estate demanded that the credentials of deputies should be verified by all deputies, rather than each estate verifying the credentials of its own members, but negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neely35&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 300–01&lt;/ref&gt; The commoners appealed to the clergy, who asked for more time. Necker then stated that each estate should verify its own members' credentials and that the king should act as arbitrator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hib54&quot;&gt;Hibbert, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Assembly (1789)===
{{Main article|National Assembly (French Revolution)}}
[[Image:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|thumb|right|The National Assembly taking the [[Tennis Court Oath]] (sketch by [[Jacques-Louis David]]).]]

On 10 June 1789 Abbé Sieyès moved that the Third Estate, now meeting as the ''Communes'' (English: &quot;Commons&quot;) proceed with verifying its own powers and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them. They proceeded to do so two days later, completing the process on 17 June.&lt;ref&gt;John Hall Stewart. ''A Documentary Survey of the French Revolution''. New York: Macmillan, 1951, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Then they voted a measure far more radical, declaring themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], an assembly not of the Estates but of &quot;the People&quot;. They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met, making an excuse that the carpenters needed to prepare the hall for a royal speech in two days. Weather did not allow an outdoor meeting, so the Assembly moved their deliberations to a nearby indoor [[real tennis]] court, where they proceeded to swear the [[Tennis Court Oath]] (20 June 1789) under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schama&quot;&gt;Schama 2004, p.312&lt;/ref&gt;
A majority of the representatives of the clergy soon joined them, as did 47 members of the nobility. By 27 June, the royal party had overtly given in, although the military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles. Messages of support for the Assembly poured in from Paris and other French cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schama&quot; /&gt;

==Constitutional Monarchy==

===National Constituent Assembly (1789–91)===
{{Main article|National Constituent Assembly}}

====Storming of the Bastille====
{{Main article|Storming of the Bastille}}
By this time, Necker had earned the enmity of many members of the French court for his overt manipulation of public opinion. [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], the King's younger brother the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]], and other conservative members of the King's [[privy council]] urged him to dismiss Necker as financial advisor. On 11 July 1789, after Necker published an inaccurate account of the government's debts and made it available to the public, the King fired him, and completely restructured the finance ministry at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p.317&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Anonymous - Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] in July 1789 is widely regarded as the most iconic event of the Revolution.]]
Many Parisians presumed Louis' actions to be aimed against the Assembly and began open rebellion when they heard the news the next day. They were also afraid that arriving soldiers – mostly foreign mercenaries – had been summoned to shut down the [[National Constituent Assembly]]. The Assembly, meeting at Versailles, went into nonstop session to prevent another eviction from their meeting place. Paris was soon consumed by riots, chaos, and widespread looting. The mobs soon had the support of some of the [[Gardes Françaises|French Guard]], who were armed and trained soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the [[Bastille]] fortress, which was also perceived to be a symbol of royal power. After several hours of combat, the prison fell that afternoon. Despite ordering a ceasefire, which prevented a mutual massacre, Governor Marquis [[Bernard de Launay]] was beaten, stabbed and decapitated; his head was placed on a pike and paraded about the city. Although the fortress had held only seven prisoners (four forgers, two noblemen kept for immoral behaviour, and a murder suspect) the Bastille served as a potent symbol of everything hated under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. Returning to the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] (city hall), the mob accused the ''[[Provost (civil)|prévôt des marchands]]'' (roughly, mayor) [[Jacques de Flesselles]] of treachery and butchered him.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The King, alarmed by the violence, backed down, at least for the time being. The [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] took up command of the National Guard at Paris. [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], president of the Assembly at the time of the [[Tennis Court Oath]], became the city's mayor under a new governmental structure known as the ''commune''. The King visited Paris, where, on 17 July he accepted a [[Flag of France|tricolore]] [[cockade]], to cries of ''Vive la Nation'' (&quot;Long live the Nation&quot;) and ''Vive le Roi'' (&quot;Long live the King&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

Necker was recalled to power, but his triumph was short-lived. An astute financier but a less astute politician, Necker overplayed his hand by demanding and obtaining a general amnesty, losing much of the people's favour.

As civil authority rapidly deteriorated, with random acts of violence and theft breaking out across the country, members of the nobility, fearing for their safety, fled to neighbouring countries; many of these ''[[émigré]]s'', as they were called, funded counter-revolutionary causes within France and urged foreign monarchs to offer military support to a [[counter-revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Lefebvre, ''The French Revolution: From its Origins to 1793'' (1952) pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late July, the spirit of [[popular sovereignty]] had spread throughout France. In rural areas, many commoners began to form militias and arm themselves against a foreign invasion: some attacked the [[chateau|châteaux]] of the nobility as part of a general agrarian insurrection known as ''&quot;la Grande Peur&quot;'' (&quot;the [[Great Fear]]&quot;). In addition, wild rumours and paranoia caused widespread unrest and civil disturbances that contributed to the collapse of law and order.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, 93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abolition of feudalism ====
{{Main article|Abolition of feudalism in France}}
[[Image:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 26 August 1789]]
On the night of 4 August 1789 the National Constituent Assembly abolished [[feudalism]] (numerous peasant revolts had almost brought feudalism to an end) in the [[August Decrees]], sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate and the tithes (a 10% tax for the Church) gathered by the First Estate. During the course of a few hours nobles, clergy, towns, provinces, companies and cities lost their special privileges.&lt;ref&gt;François Furet, &quot;Night of August 4,&quot; in François Furet, and Mona Ozouf, eds. ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 107–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] summarises the night's work:
{{quote|Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude—which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office,&lt;ref&gt;The buying and selling of high office.&lt;/ref&gt; conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices ... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Georges|title=The French Revolution: Vol. 1, from Its Origins To 1793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-JDOw8v5QC&amp;pg=PA130|year=1962|publisher=Columbia U.P,|page=130|isbn=9780231085984}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Originally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a fourth of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forster, &quot;The survival of the nobility during the French Revolution&quot;. ''Past and Present'' (1967): 71–86 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/650023 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Hanson, ''The A to Z of the French Revolution'' (2013) pp. 293–94&lt;/ref&gt;

Furet emphasises that the decisions of August 1789 survived and became an integral part of
{{quote|the founding texts of modern France. They destroyed aristocratic society from top to bottom, along with its structure of dependencies and privileges. For this structure they substituted the modern, autonomous individual, free to do whatever was not prohibited by law ... The Revolution thus distinguished itself quite early by its radical individualism &lt;ref&gt;Furet, ''Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution,'' p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The old judicial system, based on the 13 regional [[parlement]]s, was suspended in November 1789, and officially abolished in September 1790. The main institutional pillars of the old regime had vanished overnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.M. Thompson, 1943 pp 90-111&quot;&gt;J.M. Thompson, ''The French Revolution'' (1943), pp. 90–111&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declaration of the Rights of Man====
{{main article|Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen}}
On 26 August 1789 the Assembly published the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which comprised a statement of principles rather than a constitution with legal effect. The Declaration was directly influenced by [[Thomas Jefferson]] working with General Lafayette, who introduced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_2wkP4j-EsC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood |page=190|isbn=9780313049514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Constituent Assembly functioned not only as a legislature, but also as a [[Constituent assembly|body to draft a new constitution]].

====Writing the first constitution====
{{main article|French Constitution of 1791}}
Necker, Mounier, Lally-Tollendal and others argued unsuccessfully for a senate, with members appointed by the crown on the nomination of the people. The bulk of the nobles argued for an aristocratic [[upper house]] elected by the nobles. The popular party carried the day: France would have a single, unicameral assembly. The King retained only a &quot;[[suspensive veto]]&quot;; he could delay the implementation of a law, but not block it absolutely. The Assembly eventually replaced the historic [[Provinces of France|provinces]] with 83 ''départements,'' uniformly administered and roughly equal in area and population.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.M. Thompson, 1943 pp 90-111&quot;/&gt;

Amid the Assembly's preoccupation with constitutional affairs, the financial crisis had continued largely unaddressed, and the deficit had only increased. [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Honoré Mirabeau]] now led the move to address this matter, and the Assembly gave Necker complete financial dictatorship.

====Women's March on Versailles====
{{Main article|The Women's March on Versailles}}
[[File:Women's March on Versailles01.jpg|thumb|264px|Engraving of the Women's March on Versailles, 5 October 1789]]

Fuelled by rumours of a reception for the King's bodyguards on 1 October 1789, at which the national cockade had been trampled upon, on 5 October 1789, crowds of women began to assemble at Parisian markets. The women first marched to the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], demanding that city officials address their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle 1989, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; The women were responding to the harsh economic situations they faced, especially bread shortages. They also demanded an end to royal efforts to block the National Assembly, and for the King and his administration to move to Paris as a sign of good faith in addressing the widespread poverty.

Getting unsatisfactory responses from city officials, as many as 7,000 women joined the march to Versailles, bringing with them cannons and a variety of smaller weapons. Twenty thousand National Guardsmen under the command of Lafayette responded to keep order, and members of the mob stormed the palace, killing several guards.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle 1989, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Lafayette ultimately persuaded the king to accede to the demand of the crowd that the monarchy relocate to Paris.

On 6 October 1789, the King and the royal family moved from Versailles to Paris under the &quot;protection&quot; of the National Guards, thus legitimising the National Assembly.

====Revolution and the Church====
{{Main article|Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|Civil Constitution of the Clergy}}
[[Image:Decret de l'Assemblée National qui supprime les Ordres Religieux et Religieuses.jpg|thumb|In this caricature, monks and nuns enjoy their new freedom after the decree of 16 February 1790]]

The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Roman Catholic Church to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Gemma Betros, &quot;The French Revolution and the Catholic Church,&quot; ''History Review'' (2010) Issue 68, pp. 16–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', the Church had been the largest single landowner in the country, owning about 10% of the land in the kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church was exempt from paying taxes to the government, while it levied a [[tithe]]—a 10% tax on income, often collected in the form of crops—on the general population, only a fraction of which it then redistributed to the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Resentment towards the Church weakened its power during the opening of the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] in May 1789. The Church composed the [[Estates General (France)|First Estate]] with 130,000 members of the clergy. When the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] was later created in June 1789 by the Third Estate, the clergy voted to join them, which perpetuated the destruction of the Estates General as a governing body.&lt;ref&gt;John McManners, ''The French Revolution and the Church,'' pp. 50, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Assembly began to enact social and economic reform. Legislation sanctioned on 4 August 1789 abolished the Church's authority to impose the tithe. In an attempt to address the financial crisis, the Assembly declared, on 2 November 1789, that the property of the Church was &quot;at the disposal of the nation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;National Assembly legislation cited in John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; They used this property to back a new currency, the [[assignats]]. Thus, the nation had now also taken on the responsibility of the Church, which included paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned.&lt;ref&gt;John McManners, ''The French Revolution and the Church,'' p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the Assembly began to sell the lands to the highest bidder to raise revenue, effectively decreasing the value of the assignats by 25% in two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution,'' p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1789, legislation abolished [[monastic vows]] and on 13 February 1790 all religious orders were dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Kennedy, ''A Cultural History of the French Revolution,'' p 148.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monk]]s and [[nun]]s were encouraged to return to private life and a small percentage did eventually marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution,'' 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], passed on 12 July 1790, turned the remaining clergy into employees of the state. This established an election system for parish priests and bishops and set a pay rate for the clergy. Many Catholics objected to the election system because it effectively denied the authority of the Pope in Rome over the French Church. Eventually, in November 1790, the National Assembly began to require an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution from all the members of the clergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; This led to a schism between those clergy who swore the required oath and accepted the new arrangement and those who remained loyal to the Pope. Overall, 24% of the clergy nationwide took the oath.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Kennedy, ''A Cultural History of the French Revolution,'' (1989) p 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread refusal led to legislation against the clergy, &quot;forcing them into exile, deporting them forcibly, or executing them as traitors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; [[Pope Pius VI]] never accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, further isolating the Church in France.

A new [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]] was established in 1793, with 10-day weeks that made it very difficult for Catholics to remember Sundays and saints' days. Workers complained it reduced the number of first-day-of-the-week holidays from 52 to 37.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Shaw, ''Time and the French Revolution: The Republican Calendar, 1789 – Year XIV'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Reign of Terror]], extreme efforts of de-Christianisation ensued, including the imprisonment and massacre of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France. An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether, with civic festivals replacing religious ones. The establishment of the [[Cult of Reason]] was the final step of radical de-Christianisation. These events led to a widespread disillusionment with the Revolution and to counter-rebellions across France. Locals often resisted de-Christianisation by attacking revolutionary agents and hiding members of the clergy who were being hunted. Eventually, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Committee of Public Safety]] were forced to denounce the campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution'', pp. 92–94.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the Cult of Reason with the [[deist]] but still non-Christian [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The [[Concordat of 1801]] between Napoleon and the Church ended the de-Christianisation period and established the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and the French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] via the [[separation of church and state]] on 11 December 1905. The persecution of the Church led to a counter-revolution known as the [[War in the Vendee|Revolt in the Vendée]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack R. Censer, &quot;Historians Revisit the Terror – Again&quot;. ''Journal of Social History'' 48#2 (2014): 383–403.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians [[Lynn Hunt]] and Jack Censer argue that some French Protestants, the [[Huguenots]], wanted an anti-Catholic regime, and that Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Voltaire]] helped fuel this resentment.&lt;ref&gt;Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[John McManners]] writes, &quot;In eighteenth-century France throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John McManners, ''The French Revolution and the Church'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrigues and radicalism====
Factions within the Assembly began to clarify. The aristocrat [[Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazalès]] and the [[abbé]] [[Jean-Sifrein Maury]] led what would become known as the [[right-wing politics|right wing]], the opposition to revolution (this party sat on the right-hand side of the Assembly). The &quot;Royalist democrats&quot; or ''monarchiens'', allied with [[Jacques Necker|Necker]], inclined towards organising France along lines similar to the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]]al model; they included [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], the [[Trophime-Gérard, marquis de Lally-Tollendal|Comte de Lally-Tollendal]], the [[Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre|comte de Clermont-Tonnerre]], and [[Pierre Victor, baron Malouet|Pierre Victor Malouet, comte de Virieu]].

The &quot;National Party&quot;, representing the centre or centre-left of the assembly, included [[Honoré Mirabeau]], Lafayette, and Bailly; while [[Adrien Duport]], [[Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave|Barnave]] and [[Alexandre Lameth]] represented somewhat more extreme views. Almost alone in his radicalism on the left was the [[Arras, France|Arras]] lawyer [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. Abbé [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]] led in proposing legislation in this period and successfully forged consensus for some time between the political centre and the [[left-wing politics|left]]. In Paris, various committees, the mayor, the assembly of representatives, and the individual districts each claimed authority independent of the others. The increasingly middle-class [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] under Lafayette also slowly emerged as a power in its own right, as did other self-generated assemblies.
[[Image:Federation.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Fête de la Fédération]]'' on 14 July 1790 celebrated the establishment of the constitutional monarchy]]
The Assembly abolished the symbolic paraphernalia of the ''Ancien Régime'' – armorial bearings, liveries, etc. – which further alienated the more conservative nobles, and added to the ranks of the ''[[émigré]]s''. On 14 July 1790, and for several days following, crowds in the [[Champ de Mars]] celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille with the ''[[Fête de la Fédération]]''; [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] performed a [[mass (liturgy)|mass]]; participants swore an oath of &quot;fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king&quot;; the King and the royal family actively participated.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, pp. 433–34&lt;/ref&gt;

The electors had originally chosen the members of the [[French Estates-General|Estates-General]] to serve for a single year. However, by the terms of the [[Tennis Court Oath]], the ''communes'' had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution. Right-wing elements now argued for a new election, but Mirabeau prevailed, asserting that the status of the assembly had fundamentally changed, and that no new election should take place before completing the constitution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In late 1790 the French army was in considerable disarray. The military officer corps was largely composed of noblemen, who found it increasingly difficult to maintain order within the ranks. In some cases, soldiers (drawn from the lower classes) had turned against their aristocratic commanders and attacked them. At [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], General [[François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé|Bouillé]] successfully put down one such rebellion, only to be accused of being anti-revolutionary for doing so. This and other such incidents spurred a mass desertion as more and more officers defected to other countries, leaving a dearth of experienced leadership within the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Doyle|title=Aristocracy and its Enemies in the Age of Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flWyXPMY4tcC&amp;pg=PP334|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=334–36|isbn=9780191609718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw the rise of the political &quot;clubs&quot; in French politics. Foremost among these was the [[Jacobin Club]]; 152 members had affiliated with the Jacobins by 10 August 1790. The Jacobin Society began as a broad, general organisation for political debate, but as it grew in members, various factions developed with widely differing views. Several of these factions broke off to form their own clubs, such as the Club of '89.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organisation made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. [[Jury trial]]s started for criminal cases. The King would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds, masterships, and workers' organisations: any individual gained the right to practise a trade through the purchase of a license; strikes became illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal flight to Varennes====
{{Main article|Flight to Varennes}}
[[File:Retour Varennes 1791.jpg|thumb|The return of the royal family to Paris on 25 June 1791, after their failed flight to Varennes]]
Louis XVI was increasingly dismayed by the direction of the revolution. His brother, the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]] and his queen, Marie Antoinette, urged a stronger stance against the revolution and support for the émigrés, while he was resistant to any course that would see him openly side with foreign powers against the Assembly. Eventually, fearing for his own safety and that of his family, he decided to flee Paris to the Austrian border, having been assured of the loyalty of the border garrisons.

Louis cast his lot with [[François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé|General Bouillé]], who condemned both the emigration and the Assembly, and promised him refuge and support in his camp at [[Montmédy]]. On the night of 20 June 1791 the royal family fled the [[Tuileries Palace]] dressed as servants, while their servants dressed as nobles.

However, late the next day, the King was recognised and arrested at [[Varennes]] and returned to Paris. The Assembly provisionally suspended the King. He and Queen [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]] remained held under guard.&lt;ref name=tackett&gt;Timothy Tackett, ''When the King Took Flight'' (Harvard University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The King's flight had a profound impact on public opinion, turning popular sentiment further against the clergy and nobility, and built momentum for the institution of a constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref name=tackett /&gt;

====Completing the constitution====
{{Main article|French Revolution from the summer of 1790 to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly#The Last Days of the National Constituent Assembly|l1=The Last Days of the National Constituent Assembly}}
As most of the Assembly still favoured a [[constitutional monarchy]] rather than a republic, the various groups reached a compromise which left Louis XVI as little more than a figurehead: he was forced to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to abdication.

However, [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] drafted a petition, insisting that in the eyes of the nation Louis XVI was deposed since his flight. An immense crowd gathered in the [[Champ de Mars]] to sign the petition. [[Georges Danton]] and [[Camille Desmoulins]] gave fiery speeches. The Assembly called for the municipal authorities to &quot;preserve public order&quot;. The National Guard under Lafayette's command confronted the crowd. The soldiers responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd, killing between 13 and 50 people.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; The incident cost Lafayette and his National Guard much public support.

In the wake of the massacre the authorities closed many of the patriotic clubs, as well as radical newspapers such as [[Jean-Paul Marat]]'s ''[[L'Ami du Peuple]]''. Danton fled to England; Desmoulins and Marat went into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford D. Conner, ''Jean-Paul Marat: Tribune of the French Revolution'' (2012) ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a new threat arose from abroad: the King's brother-in-law [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II]], [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], and the King's brother [[Charles X of France|Charles-Philippe, comte d'Artois]], issued the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]], which proclaimed the cause of Louis XVI as their own, demanded his absolute liberty and hinted at an invasion of France on his behalf if the revolutionary authorities refused its conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p.500&lt;/ref&gt; Although Leopold himself sought to avoid war and made the declaration to satisfy the Comte d'Artois and the other émigrés, the reaction within France was ferocious. The French people expressed no respect for the dictates of foreign monarchs, and the threat of force merely hastened their militarisation.&lt;ref&gt;Soboul (1975), pp. 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the Flight to Varennes, the Assembly members had determined to debar themselves from the legislature that would succeed them, the [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. They now gathered the various constitutional laws they had passed into a single constitution, and submitted it to the recently restored Louis XVI, who accepted it, writing &quot;I engage to maintain it at home, to defend it from all attacks from abroad, and to cause its execution by all the means it places at my disposal&quot;. The King addressed the Assembly and received enthusiastic applause from members and spectators. With this capstone, the National Constituent Assembly adjourned in a final session on 30 September 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative Assembly (1791–92)===

====Failure of the constitutional monarchy====
{{Monarchism}}
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
{{See also|Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly}}
Under the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]], France would function as a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The King had to share power with the elected [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], but he retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791, and degenerated into chaos less than a year later. Francis Charles Montague concluded in 1911, &quot;In the attempt to govern, the Assembly failed altogether. It left behind an empty treasury, an undisciplined army and navy, and a people debauched by safe and successful riot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Francis Charles Montague|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9I9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA158|year=1911|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, the King vetoed legislation that threatened the ''émigrés'' with death and that decreed that every [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|non-juring clergyman]] must take within eight days the civic oath mandated by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Over the course of a year, such disagreements would lead to a [[constitutional crisis]].

Lyons argues that the Constituent Assembly had liberal, rational, and individualistic goals that seem to have been largely achieved by 1791. However, it failed to consolidate the gains of the Revolution, which continued with increasing momentum and escalating radicalism until 1794. Lyons identifies six reasons for this escalation. First, the king did not accept the limitations on his powers, and mobilised support from foreign monarchs to reverse it. Second, the effort to overthrow the Roman Catholic Church, sell off its lands, close its monasteries and its charitable operations, and replace it with an unpopular makeshift system caused deep consternation among the pious and the peasants. Third, the economy was badly hurt by the issuance of ever increasing amounts of paper money (''[[assignat]]s''), which caused more and more inflation; the rising prices hurt the urban poor who spent most of their income on food. Fourth, the rural peasants demanded liberation from the heavy system of taxes and dues owed to local landowners. Fifth, the working class of Paris and the other cities—the [[sans-culottes]]—resented the fact that the property owners and professionals had taken all the spoils of the Revolution. Finally, foreign powers threatened to overthrow the Revolution, which responded with extremism and systematic violence in its own defence.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Lyons, ''France under the Directory'' (1975), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

What remained of a national government depended on the support of the insurrectionary Commune. With enemy troops advancing, the Commune looked for potential traitors in Paris. The Commune sent gangs of National Guardsmen and fereres into the prisons to kill 10 or more victims, mostly nonjuring priests. The Commune then sent a circular letter to the other cities of France inviting them to follow this example, and many cities launched their own massacres of prisoners and priests in the &quot;September massacres&quot;. The Assembly could offer only feeble resistance. In October, however, there was a counterattack accusing the instigators, especially Marat, of being terrorists. This led to a political contest between the more moderate Girondists and the more radical Montagnards inside the Convention, with rumour used as a weapon by both sides. The Girondists lost ground when they seemed too conciliatory. But the pendulum swung again and after Thermidor, the men who had endorsed the massacres were denounced as terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Gershoy, ''The French Revolution and Napoleon'' pp 221–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Tackett, &quot;Rumor and Revolution: The Case of the September Massacres&quot;, ''French History and Civilization'' (2011) Vol. 4, pp. 54–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos persisted until the [[French National Convention|Convention]], elected by universal male suffrage and charged with writing a new constitution, met on 20 September 1792 and became the new ''de facto'' government of France. The next day it [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolished the monarchy]] and declared a republic. The following day – 22 September 1792, the first morning of the new Republic – was later retroactively adopted as the beginning of [[Year One]] of the [[French Republican Calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle (2003), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars==
{{main article|French Revolutionary Wars|Napoleonic Wars}}
From 1793 to 1815 France was engaged almost continuously (with two short breaks) in wars with Britain and a changing coalition of other major powers. The many French successes led to the spread of the French revolutionary ideals into neighbouring countries, and indeed across much of Europe. However, the final defeat of Napoleon in 1814 (and 1815) brought a reaction that reversed some – but not all – of the revolutionary achievements in France and Europe. The Bourbons were restored to the throne, with the brother of executed King Louis XVI becoming [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]].

The politics of the period inevitably drove France towards war with Austria and its allies. The King, many of the Feuillants, and the Girondins specifically wanted to wage war. The King (and many Feuillants with him) expected war would increase his personal popularity; he also foresaw an opportunity to exploit any defeat: either result would make him stronger. The Girondins wanted to [[export the Revolution]] throughout Europe and, by extension, to defend the Revolution within France. The forces opposing war were much weaker. Barnave and his supporters among the Feuillants feared a war they thought France had little chance to win and which they feared might lead to greater radicalisation of the revolution. On the other end of the political spectrum [[Maximilien Robespierre#Opposition to war with Austria|Robespierre opposed a war on two grounds]], fearing that it would strengthen the monarchy and military at the expense of the revolution, and that it would incur the anger of ordinary people in Austria and elsewhere. The Austrian emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], brother of [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], may have wished to avoid war, but he died on 1 March 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; France preemptively declared war on Austria (20 April 1792) and [[Prussia]] joined on the Austrian side a few weeks later. The invading Prussian army faced little resistance until checked at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (20 September 1792) and was forced to withdraw.

[[File:Bataille de Fleurus 1794.JPG|thumb|left|The [[French Revolutionary Army]] defeated the combined armies of Austrians, Dutch and British at Fleurus in June 1794.]]
The new-born Republic followed up on this success with a series of victories in Belgium and the [[Rhineland]] in the fall of 1792. The French armies defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November, and had soon taken over most of the Austrian Netherlands. This brought them into conflict with Britain and the [[Dutch Republic]], which wished to preserve the independence of the southern Netherlands from France. After the king's execution in January 1793, these powers, along with Spain and most other European states, joined the war against France. Almost immediately, French forces faced defeat on many fronts, and were driven out of their newly conquered territories in the spring of 1793. At the same time, the republican regime was forced to deal with rebellions against its authority in much of western and southern France. But the allies failed to take advantage of French disunity, and by the autumn of 1793 the republican regime had defeated most of the internal rebellions and halted the allied advance into France itself.

The stalemate was broken in the summer of 1794 with dramatic French victories. They defeated the allied army at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], leading to a full Allied withdrawal from the Austrian Netherlands. They followed up by a campaign which swept the allies to the east bank of the Rhine and left the French, by the beginning of 1795, conquering the Dutch Republic itself. The House of Orange was expelled and replaced by the [[Batavian Republic]], a French satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the coalition against France. Prussia, having effectively abandoned the coalition in the fall of 1794, made peace with revolutionary France at [[Peace of Basel|Basel]] in April 1795, and soon thereafter Spain, too, made peace with France. Of the major powers, only Britain and Austria remained at war with France.

===Colonial uprisings===

Although the French Revolution had a dramatic impact in numerous areas of Europe, the French colonies felt a particular influence. As the [[Martinique|Martinican]] author [[Aimé Césaire]] put it, &quot;there was in each French colony a specific revolution, that occurred on the occasion of the French Revolution, in tune with it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Dorginy, ''The Abolition of Slavery: From L.F. Sonthonax to Victor Schoelcher, 1793, 1794, 1848'' (Paris: UNESCO, 2003), 167–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Haitian Revolution]] (Saint Domingue) became a central example of slave uprisings in French colonies.

====Execution of Louis XVI====

{{Main article|Execution of Louis XVI}}
{{See also|Maximilien_Robespierre#Execution_of_Louis_XVI|l1=Robespierre and the Execution of Louis XVI}}
In the [[Brunswick Manifesto]], the Imperial and Prussian armies threatened retaliation on the French population if it were to resist their advance or the reinstatement of the monarchy. This [[Armoire de fer|among other things]] made Louis appear to be conspiring with the enemies of France. On 17 January 1793 Louis was condemned to death for &quot;conspiracy against the public liberty and the general safety&quot; by a close majority in Convention: 361 voted to execute the king, 288 voted against, and another 72 voted to execute him subject to a variety of delaying conditions. The former Louis XVI, now simply named ''Citoyen Louis Capet'' (Citizen Louis Capet) was executed by [[guillotine]] on 21 January 1793 on the ''Place de la Révolution'', former ''Place Louis XV'', now called the [[Place de la Concorde]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle 2002, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives across Europe were horrified and monarchies called for war against revolutionary France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellis Wasson|title=A History of Modern Britain: 1714 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5spbTRMfo8C&amp;pg=PA118|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=118|isbn=9781405139359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Doyle|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DerOCz4HRIC&amp;pg=PT396|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=396–97|isbn=9780191608292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy====
When war went badly, prices rose and the ''[[sans-culottes]]''&amp;nbsp;– poor labourers and radical Jacobins – rioted; counter-revolutionary activities began in some regions. This encouraged the Jacobins to seize power through a parliamentary ''[[coup d'état|coup]]'', backed up by force effected by mobilising public support against the [[Girondist]] faction, and by utilising the mob power of the Parisian ''sans-culottes''. An alliance of Jacobin and ''sans-culottes'' elements thus became the effective centre of the new government. Policy became considerably more radical, as [[General maximum|&quot;The Law of the Maximum&quot;]] set food prices and led to executions of offenders.&lt;ref&gt;White, E. &quot;The French Revolution and the Politics of Government Finance, 1770–1815.&quot; ''The Journal of Economic History'' 1995, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy of price control was coeval with the [[Committee of Public Safety]]'s rise to power and the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Committee first attempted to set the price for only a limited number of grain products but, by September 1793, it expanded the &quot;maximum&quot; to cover all foodstuffs and a long list of other goods.&lt;ref&gt;Schuettinger, Robert. &quot;Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls.&quot; Heritage Foundation, 2009. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread shortages and famine ensued. The Committee reacted by sending [[dragoon]]s into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops. This temporarily solved the problem in Paris, but the rest of the country suffered. By the spring of 1794, forced collection of food was not sufficient to feed even Paris and the days of the Committee were numbered. When Robespierre went to the guillotine in July of that year the crowd jeered, &quot;There goes the dirty maximum!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, Henry. &quot;Maximum Prices in France.&quot; American Historical Review, October 1917, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reign of Terror====
{{Main article|Reign of Terror}}
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Marie Antoinette on the Way to the Guillotine.jpg|thumb|Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] on the way to the guillotine on 16 October 1793 (drawing by [[Jacques-Louis David]]).]]
The [[Committee of Public Safety]] came under the control of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a lawyer, and the Jacobins unleashed the Reign of Terror (1793–94). According to archival records, at least 16,594 people died under the [[guillotine]] or otherwise after accusations of counter-revolutionary activities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gough-p77&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gough, Hugh|title=The Terror in the French Revolution|year=1998|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 40,000 accused prisoners may have been summarily executed without [[trial]] or died awaiting trial.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gough-p77&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle 1989, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 1793, Paris sections&amp;nbsp;– encouraged by the ''[[enragés]]'' (&quot;enraged ones&quot;) [[Jacques Roux]] and [[Jacques Hébert]] – took over the [[French Convention|Convention]], calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral [[suffrage|franchise]] to ''[[sans-culottes]]'' alone.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 616&lt;/ref&gt; With the backing of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], they managed to persuade the Convention to arrest 31 Girondin leaders, including [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]]. Following these arrests, the Jacobins gained control of the Committee of Public Safety on 10 June, installing the ''revolutionary dictatorship''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schama 2004, p.641&quot;&gt;Schama 2004, p. 641&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July, the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]]&amp;nbsp;– a Jacobin leader and journalist known for his bloodthirsty rhetoric&amp;nbsp;– by [[Charlotte Corday]], a Girondin, resulted in further increase of Jacobin political influence. [[Georges Danton]], the leader of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|August 1792 uprising]] against the [[Louis XVI of France|king]], undermined by several political reversals, was removed from the Committee and Robespierre, &quot;the Incorruptible&quot;, became its most influential member as it moved to take radical measures against the Revolution's domestic and foreign enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schama 2004, p.641&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, on 24 June, the Convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, variously referred to as the [[French Constitution of 1793]] or Constitution of the Year I. It was progressive and radical in several respects, in particular by establishing [[universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]]. It was ratified by public referendum, but normal legal processes were suspended before it could take effect.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 637&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BatailleduMans1793.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[War in the Vendée]] was a royalist uprising that was suppressed by the republican forces in 1796.]]
In [[Vendée]], peasants revolted against the French Revolutionary government in 1793. They resented the changes imposed on the Roman Catholic Church by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] (1790) and broke into open revolt in defiance of the Revolutionary government's military [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DB1231F934A25755C0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all In a Corner of France, Long Live the Old Regime], [[New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; This became a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]], known as the [[War in the Vendée]].&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Peter [http://www.h-france.net/vol4reviews/mcphee3.html Review of Reynald Secher, A French Genocide: The Vendée] H-France Review Vol. 4 (March 2004), No. 26 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420184315/http://www.h-france.net/vol4reviews/mcphee3.html |date=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North of the [[Loire river|Loire]], similar revolts were started by the so-called [[Chouannerie|Chouans]] (royalist rebels).&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt and its suppression, including both combat casualties and massacres and executions on both sides, are thought to have taken between 117,000 and 250,000 lives (170,000 according to the latest estimates).&lt;ref&gt;117,000 according to Reynald Secher, ''La Vendée-Vengé, le Génocide franco-français'' (1986); 200,000–250,000 according to Jean-Clément Martin, ''La Vendée et la France'', Éditions du Seuil, collection Points, 1987; 200,000 according to Louis-Marie Clénet, ''La Contre-révolution'', Paris, PUF, collection Que sais-je?, 1992; 170,000 according to Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ''&quot; Détruisez la Vendée ! &quot; Regards croisés sur les victimes et destructions de la guerre de Vendée'', La Roche-sur-Yon, Centre vendéen de recherches historiques, 2007, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the extremely brutal forms that the Republican repression took in many places, certain historians such as Reynald Secher have called the event a &quot;genocide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Cough,  &quot;Genocide and the Bicentenary: the French Revolution and the Revenge of the Vendee.&quot; ''Historical Journal'' 30#4 (1987): 977–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Joes, &quot;Insurgency and Genocide: La Vendée.&quot; ''Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies'' 9#3 (1998): 17–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term is rejected by Michel Vovelle, &quot; L'historiographie de la Révolution Française à la veille du bicentenaire &quot;, ''Estudos avançados'', octobre-décembre 1987, volume 1, n° 1, pp. 61–72. [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-40141987000100006&amp;script=sci_arttext] ou [http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ea/v1n1/v1n1a06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Furet concludes that the repression in the Vendee &quot;not only revealed massacre and destruction on an unprecedented scale but also a zeal so violent that it has bestowed as its legacy much of the region's identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;François Furet and Mona Ozouf, eds. ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution'' (1989), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing local revolts and foreign invasions in both the East and West of the country, the most urgent government business was the war. On 17 August, the Convention voted for general [[conscription]], the ''[[levée en masse]]'', which mobilised all citizens to serve as soldiers or suppliers in the war effort.

The [[National Convention]] subsequently enacted more legislation, voting on 9 September to establish ''sans-culottes'' paramilitary forces, ''revolutionary armies'', and to force farmers to surrender [[grain]] demanded by the government. On 17 September, the ''[[Law of Suspects]]'' was passed, which authorised the charging of counter-revolutionaries with &quot;crimes against liberty.&quot; On 29 September, the Convention extended price limits from grain and bread to other household goods and established the [[General maximum|Law of the Maximum]], intended to prevent price gouging and supply food to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 646&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systematic executions====
The [[guillotine]] became the tool for a string of executions. Louis XVI had already been guillotined before the start of the terror; Queen Marie Antoinette, Barnave, Bailly, Brissot and other leading Girondins, [[Louis Philip II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe Égalité]] (despite his vote for the death of the King), [[Madame Roland]] and many others were executed by guillotine. The [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] summarily condemned thousands of people to death by the guillotine, while mobs beat other victims to death.

[[File:Octobre 1793, supplice de 9 émigrés.jpg|thumb|250px|Nine emigrants go to the guillotine in 1793]]
At the peak of the terror, the slightest hint of counter-revolutionary thoughts or activities (or, as in the case of [[Jacques Hébert]], revolutionary zeal exceeding that of those in power) could place one under suspicion, and trials did not always proceed according to contemporary standards of [[due process]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Sometimes people died for their political opinions or actions, but many for little reason beyond mere suspicion, or because some others had a stake in getting rid of them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Most of the victims received an unceremonious trip to the guillotine in an open wooden cart (the [[tumbrel]]). In the rebellious provinces, the government representatives had unlimited authority and some engaged in extreme repressions and abuses. For example, [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]] became notorious for the ''[[Drownings at Nantes|Noyades]]'' (&quot;drownings&quot;) he organised in [[Nantes]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97009/Jean-Baptiste-Carrier Jean-Baptiste Carrier], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; his conduct was judged unacceptable even by the Jacobin government and he was recalled.&lt;ref&gt;Soboul (1975), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] uprising was made possible by the instalment of the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]] on 24 October 1793. Against Robespierre's concepts of [[Deism]] and [[Virtue]], Hébert's (and Chaumette's) [[atheism|atheist]] movement initiated a religious campaign to [[Christianity|dechristianise]] society. The climax was reached with the celebration of the flame of Reason in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] Cathedral on 10 November.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 658&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reign of Terror ultimately weakened the revolutionary government, while temporarily ending internal opposition. The Jacobins expanded the size of the army, and [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] replaced many aristocratic officers with soldiers who had demonstrated their patriotism, if not their ability. The Republican army repulsed the Austrians, [[Prussia]]ns, British, and Spanish. At the end of 1793, the army began to prevail and revolts were defeated with ease. The [[Ventôse Decrees]] (February–March 1794) proposed the confiscation of the goods of exiles and opponents of the Revolution, and their redistribution to the needy. However, this policy was never fully implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 689&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fête de l'Etre suprême 1.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Cult of the Supreme Being|Festival of the Supreme Being]] on 8 June 1794.]]
In the spring of 1794, both extremist ''enragés'' such as Hébert and moderate [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] ''indulgents'' such as Danton were charged with counter-revolutionary activities, tried and guillotined. On 7 June Robespierre, who had previously condemned the ''[[Cult of Reason]]'', advocated a new state religion and recommended the Convention acknowledge the existence of the &quot;Supreme Being&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 706&lt;/ref&gt;

Three approaches attempt to explain the [[Reign of Terror]] imposed by the Jacobins in 1793–94. The older Marxist interpretation argued the Terror was a necessary response to outside threats (in terms of other countries going to war with France) and internal threats (of traitors inside France threatening to frustrate the Revolution.) In this interpretation, as expressed by the Marxist historian [[Albert Soboul]], Robespierre and the sans-culottes were heroes for defending the revolution from its enemies. [[François Furet]] has argued that foreign threats had little to do with the terror.&lt;ref&gt;François Furet, &quot;A Deep-rooted Ideology as Well as Circumstance,&quot; in ''The French Revolution: Conflicting Interpretations,'' ed. by Frank Kafker et al. (2002). p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the extreme violence was an inherent part of the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries – their utopian goals required exterminating opposition. Soboul's Marxist interpretation has been largely abandoned by most historians since the 1990s. Hanson (2009) takes a middle position, recognising the importance of the foreign enemies, and sees the terror as a contingency that was caused by the interaction of a series of complex events and the foreign threat. Hanson says the terror was not inherent in the ideology of the Revolution, but that circumstances made it necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Hanson, ''Contesting the French Revolution'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thermidorian Reaction====
{{Main article|Thermidorian Reaction}}
[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|thumb|250px|The execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794 marked the end of the [[Reign of Terror]].]]
On 27 July 1794, the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] led to the arrest and execution of Robespierre, [[Louis de Saint-Just]], and other leading Jacobins. The new government was predominantly made up of Girondists who had survived the Terror, and after taking power, they took revenge as well by persecuting even those Jacobins who had helped to overthrow Robespierre, banning the Jacobin Club, and executing many of its former members in what was known as the [[First White Terror|White Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;Soboul (1975), pp. 425–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 852.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of excesses of the Terror, the Convention approved the new &quot;[[Constitution of the Year III]]&quot; on 22 August 1795. A French [[plebiscite]] ratified the document, with about 1,057,000 votes for the constitution and 49,000 against.&lt;ref name = &quot;Doyle-p320&quot;&gt;Doyle 1989, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the voting were announced on 23 September 1795, and the new constitution took effect on 27 September 1795.&lt;ref name = &quot;Doyle-p320&quot;/&gt; The new regime was called &quot;The Directory&quot;.

===The Directory (1795–99)===
{{Main article|French Directory}}
The new constitution created the ''Directoire'' ({{lang-en|Directory}}) with a [[bicameral legislature]]. Power was in the hands of the five members of the Directory, only one of whom, [[Lazare Carnot]], has a reputation for leadership or political sagacity.&lt;ref&gt;Louis R. Gottschalk, ''The Era of the French Revolution (1715–1815)'' (1929) p.  281&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directory denounced the arbitrary executions of the Reign of Terror, but itself engaged in large scale illegal repressions, as well as large-scale massacres of civilians in the Vendee uprising. The economy continued in bad condition, with the poor especially hurt by the high cost of food. A series of financial reforms started by the Directory finally took effect after it fell from power. Although committed to Republicanism, the Directory distrusted democracy. When the elections of 1798 and 1799 were carried by the opposition, it used the Army to imprison and exile the opposition leaders and close their newspapers. Increasingly it depended on the Army in foreign and domestic affairs, as well as finance. Finally the Army, under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], simply deposed the Directory on 9 November 1799 (see [[18 Brumaire]]) and set up what amounted to a personal dictatorship under Napoleon.

Historians have seldom praised the Directory; it was a government of self-interest rather than virtue, thus losing any claim on idealism. It never had a strong base of popular support; when elections were held, most of its candidates were defeated. Its achievements were minor.&lt;ref name=&quot;François Furet 1995 p 155&quot;&gt;François Furet, ''Revolutionary France 1770–1880'' (1995) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard G. Brown|title=Ending the French Revolution: Violence, Justice, and Repression from the Terror to Napoleon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QccRae4wRZoC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2007|publisher=U. of Virginia Press|pages=5–7|isbn=9780813927299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown stresses the turn towards dictatorship and the failure of liberal democracy under the Directory, blaming it on, &quot;chronic violence, ambivalent forms of justice, and repeated recourse to heavy-handed repression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown|title=Ending the French Revolution: Violence, Justice, and Repression from the Terror to Napoleon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QccRae4wRZoC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2007|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Bataille du Pont d'Arcole.jpg|thumb|250px|General Napoleon and his troops crossing the [[Battle of the Bridge of Arcole|bridge of Arcole]] in 1796]]
The election system was complex and designed to insulate the government from grass roots democracy. The parliament consisted of two houses: the ''Conseil des Cinq-Cents'' (Council of the Five Hundred) with 500 representatives, and the ''Conseil des Anciens'' (Council of Elders) with 250 senators. Executive power went to five &quot;directors,&quot; named annually by the ''Conseil des Anciens'' from a list submitted by the ''Conseil des Cinq-Cents''. Furthermore, the [[universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]] of 1793 was replaced by limited suffrage based on property. The voters had only a limited choice because the electoral rules required two-thirds of the seats go to members of the old Convention, no matter how few popular votes they received.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''Oxford History'' (2003) pp. 318–40&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of the Directory, contemporary observers might have assumed that the Revolution was finished. Citizens of the war-weary nation wanted stability, peace, and an end to conditions that at times bordered on chaos. Those on the right who wished to restore the monarchy by putting [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] on the throne, and those on the left who would have renewed the Reign of Terror tried but failed to overthrow the Directory. The earlier atrocities had made confidence or goodwill between parties impossible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle, Oxford History p.331&quot;&gt;Doyle, ''Oxford History'' p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

State finances were in total disarray; the government could only cover its expenses through the plunder and the tribute of foreign countries. If peace were made, the armies would return home and the directors would have to face the exasperation of the rank-and-file who had lost their livelihood, as well as the ambition of generals who could, in a moment, brush them aside. [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] and [[Jean-François Rewbell|Rewbell]] were notoriously corrupt themselves and screened corruption in others. The patronage of the directors was ill-bestowed, and the general maladministration heightened their unpopularity.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''Oxford History'', pp. 322–23&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carngwasted &amp; Ebewalin.jpeg|thumb|250px|A small French force tried to [[Battle of Fishguard|invade Britain]] in February 1797. This contemporary image shows troops landing near Fishguard in Wales. The troops were later forced to surrender.]]
[[Image:Bouchot - Le general Bonaparte au Conseil des Cinq-Cents.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Napoléon Bonaparte]] in the [[18 Brumaire|''coup d'état'' of 18 Brumaire]], which marked the end of the revolution.]]

The constitutional party in the legislature desired toleration of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|nonjuring clergy]], the repeal of the laws against the relatives of the [[émigré]]s, and some merciful discrimination towards the émigrés themselves. The directors baffled all such endeavours. On the other hand, the socialist conspiracy of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]] was easily quelled. Little was done to improve the finances, and the [[assignat]]s continued to fall in value until each note was worth less than the paper it was printed on; debtors easily paid off their debts.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''Oxford History'' (2003) pp. 322–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The new régime met opposition from Jacobins on the left and royalists on the right (the latter were secretly subsidised by the British government). The army suppressed riots and counter-revolutionary activities. In this way the army and in particular Napoleon gained total power. In the elections of 1797 for one-third of the seats the Royalists won the great majority of seats and were poised to take control of the Directory in the next election. The Directory reacted by purging all the winners in the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]], banishing 57 leaders to certain death in Guiana and closing 42 newspapers. That is, it rejected democratic elections and kept its old leaders in power.

On 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire of the Year VIII) [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] staged the ''[[18 Brumaire|coup of 18 Brumaire]]'' which installed the [[French Consulate|Consulate]]. This effectively led to Bonaparte's dictatorship and eventually (in 1804) to his proclamation as ''Empereur'' (emperor) which brought to a close the specifically republican phase of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;David Nicholls, ''Napoleon: a biographical companion'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exporting the Revolution====
The Army at first was quite successful. It conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands and made it a puppet state. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However, the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, retaking Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands and ending the flow of payments from the conquered areas to France. The treasury was empty. Despite his publicity claiming many glorious victories, Napoleon's army was trapped in Egypt after the British sank the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]]. Napoleon escaped by himself, returned to Paris and overthrew the Directory in November, 1799.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 341–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History, 1789–1815: France Against Europe'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle bergen.jpg|thumb|240px|[[French First Republic|French]]-[[Batavian Republic|Dutch]] victory under [[Guillaume Marie Anne Brune|General Brune]] and [[Herman Willem Daendels|General Daendels]] against the Russians and British in 1799.]]
Napoleon conquered most of Italy in the name of the French Revolution in 1797–99. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centred on Milan. Genoa the city became a republic while its hinterland became the [[Ligurian Republic]]. The [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] was formed out of the papal holdings and the pope was sent to France. The [[Neapolitan Republic (1799)|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months before the enemy forces of the Coalition recaptured it. In 1805 he formed the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], with himself as king and his stepson as viceroy. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernised, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp. 62–65, 78–79, 88–96, 115–17, 154–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasises the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:
:For nearly two decades the Italians had the excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick  B. Artz, ''Reaction and Revolution: 1814–1832'' (1934) pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and symbolism ==
{{main article|Symbolism in the French Revolution}}

===Newspapers===
[[Image:L'Ami du peuple 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A copy of ''L'Ami du peuple'' stained with the blood of Marat]]
In the Old regime there were a small number of heavily censored newspapers that needed a royal licence to operate. Newspapers and pamphlets played a central role in stimulating and defining the Revolution. The meetings of the Estates-General in 1789 created an enormous demand for news, and over 130 newspapers appeared by the end of the year. Among the most significant of these newspapers in 1789 were Marat's ''L'Ami du peuple'' and [[Elysée Loustallot|Elysée Loustallot's]] ''Revolutions de Paris''. The next decade saw 2000 newspapers founded, with 500 in Paris alone. Most lasted only a matter of weeks. Together they became the main communication medium, combined with the very large pamphlet literature.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Chisick,  &quot;The pamphlet literature of the French revolution: An overview.&quot; ''History of European ideas'' (1993) 17#2–3 pp. 149–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers were read aloud in taverns and clubs, and circulated hand to hand. The press saw its lofty role to be the advancement of civic republicanism based on public service, and downplayed the liberal, individualistic goal of making a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Chapman, &quot;Republican citizenship, ethics and the French revolutionary press,&quot; ''Ethical Space: The International Journal of Communication Ethics'' (2005) 2#1 pp. 7–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Gough, ''The Newspaper Press in the French Revolution'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Popkin, ''Revolutionary News: The Press in France 1789–1799'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, &quot;The Press and the French revolution after two hundred years.&quot; ''French Historical Studies'' (1990): 664–83 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/286493 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1793 the radicals were most active but at the start the royalists flooded the country with their press the &quot;Ami du Roi&quot; (Friends of the King) until they were suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Chisick, &quot;Pamphlets and Journalism in the Early French Revolution: The Offices of the Ami du Roi of the Abbé Royou as a Center of Royalist Propaganda,&quot; ''French Historical Studies'' (1988) 15#4 623–45 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/286549 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon only allowed four newspapers, all under tight control.

===Symbolism===
Symbolism was a device to distinguish the main features of the Revolution and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Censer and Hunt, &quot;How to Read Images&quot; LEF CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt;

 |description  = The French national anthem ''La Marseillaise''; text in French.}}

&quot;La Marseillaise&quot; ({{IPA-fr|la maʁsɛjɛz}}) became the [[national anthem]] of France. The song was written and composed in 1792 by [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]], and was originally titled &quot;''Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin''&quot;. The [[French National Convention]] adopted it as the [[French First Republic|First Republic's]] anthem in 1795. It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by [[Fédéré|volunteers]] from [[Marseille]] marching on the capital.

The song is the first example of the &quot;European march&quot; anthemic style. The anthem's evocative melody and lyrics have led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and its incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music. Cerulo says, &quot;the design of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is credited to General Strasburg of France, who is said
to have directed de Lisle, the composer of the anthem, to 'produce one of those hymns which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. Cerulo, &quot;Symbols and the world system: national anthems and flags.&quot; ''Sociological Forum'' (1993) 8#2 pp. 243–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guillotine===
{{main article|Guillotine}}
Hanson notes, &quot;The guillotine stands as the principal symbol of the Terror in the French Revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R. Hanson|title=The A to Z of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYJ4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker, more efficient and more distinctive form of execution, the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory. It was celebrated on the left as the people's avenger and cursed as the symbol of the [[Reign of Terror]] by the right.&lt;ref&gt;R. Po-chia Hsia, Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie G. Smith, ''The Making of the West, Peoples and Culture, A Concise History, Volume II: Since 1340'', (2nd ed., 2007), p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt; Its operation became a popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators. Vendors sold programmes listing the names of those scheduled to die. Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women ([[tricoteuse]]s) formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd. Parents often brought their children. By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically. Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Opie, ''Guillotine'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

What it is that horrifies people changes over time. Doyle comments:
:Even the unique horror of the guillotine has been dwarfed by the gas chambers of the Holocaust, the organized brutality of the gulag, the mass intimidation of Mao's cultural revolution, or the killing fields of Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Doyle|title=The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEi4bYIUP1sC&amp;pg=PT22|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tricolore cockade===
{{main article|tricolore cockade}}
Cockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789. They now pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the ''Ancien Régime'' – thus producing the original [[tricolore cockade|''Tricolore'' cockade]]. Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction—although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent, and varied somewhat by region and period.
[[File:The french tricolor cockade.svg|thumb|left|250px|The tricolour cockade, created in July 1789. White was added to &quot;nationalise&quot; an earlier blue and red design.]]

The tricolour flag is derived from the cockades used in the 1790s. These were circular rosette-like emblems attached to the hat. [[Camille Desmoulins]] asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms. Cockades with various colour schemes were used during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowdy&quot;&gt;Crowdy, Terry, ''French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802'', p. 42 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The blue and red cockade was presented to King [[Louis XVI]] at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] on 17 July. Lafayette argued for the addition of a white stripe to &quot;nationalise&quot; the design.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert Du Motier Lafayette (marquis de), ''Memoirs, correspondence and manuscripts of General Lafayette,'' vol. 2, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July, a tricolour cockade was adopted as part of the uniform of the National Guard, the national police force that succeeded the militia.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Dale, &quot;Can the Uniform Make the Citizen? Paris, 1789–1791,&quot; ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', 2001, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well after the revolution, by 1912 the [[French Third Republic]] had authorised the form of the ''tricolore cockade'' for use on its military aircraft by the ''[[History of the Armée de l'Air (1909–42)#World War I (1914–1918)|Aeronautique Militaire]]'' as a [[Military aircraft insignia#France|national insignia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw&quot;&gt;Kershaw, Andrew: ''The First War Planes, Friend Or Foe, National Aircraft Markings'', pp. 41–44. BCP Publishing, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; the first-ever in use worldwide – it is still in use by the current ''[[Armee de l'Air]]'' of France, and directly inspired the use of similar [[roundel]] insignia by [[Royal Air Force roundels|the United Kingdom]] and many other nations worldwide.

===Fasces===

[[Fasces#Fasces in France|Fasces]] are Roman in origin and suggest Roman [[Republicanism]]. Fasces are a bundle of birch rods containing an axe. The French Republic continued this Roman symbol to represent state power, justice, and unity.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

===Liberty cap===

The Liberty cap, also known as the [[Phrygian cap]], or [[Pileus (hat)|pileus]], is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. It reflects Roman republicanism and liberty, alluding to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty.&lt;ref&gt;William J.

==Role of women==
{{main article|Women in the French Revolution|Militant feminism in the French Revolution}}
[[File:Chérieux - Club des femmes patriotes dans une église - 1793.jpg|thumb|Club of patriotic women in a church]]
Historians since the late 20th century have debated how women shared in the French Revolution and what long-term impact it had on French women. Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France; they were considered &quot;passive&quot; citizens; forced to rely on men to determine what was best for them. That changed dramatically in theory as there seemingly were great advances in feminism.  Feminism emerged in Paris as part of a broad demand for social and political reform. The women demanded equality for men and then moved on to a demand for the end of male domination. Their chief vehicle for agitation were pamphlets and women's clubs, but the clubs were abolished in October 1793 and their leaders were arrested. The movement was crushed. Devance explains the decision in terms of the emphasis on masculinity in a wartime situation, Marie Antoinette's bad reputation for feminine interference in state affairs, and traditional male supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Devance, &quot;Le Féminisme pendant la Révolution Française,&quot; ''Annales Historiques de la Révolution Française'' (1977) 49#3 pp. 341–76&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later the Napoleonic Code confirmed and perpetuated women's second-class status.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Abray, &quot;Feminism in the French Revolution,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' (1975) 80#1 pp. 43–62 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1859051 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Revolution opened, groups of women acted forcefully, making use of the volatile political climate. Women forced their way into the political sphere. They swore oaths of loyalty, &quot;solemn declarations of patriotic allegiance, [and] affirmations of the political responsibilities of citizenship.&quot; [[Charlotte Corday|De Corday d'Armont]] is a prime example of such a woman; engaged in the revolutionary political faction of the [[Girondins]], she assassinated the [[Jacobins|Jacobin]] leader, [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]]. Throughout the Revolution, other women such as [[Pauline Léon]] and her [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] supported the radical Jacobins, staged demonstrations in the National Assembly and participated in the riots, often using armed force.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton &quot;Madame Roland&quot; 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The March to Versailles is but one example of feminist militant activism during the French Revolution. While largely left out of the thrust for increasing rights of citizens, as the question was left indeterminate in the Declaration of the Rights of Man,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebel Daughters pg. 79&quot;&gt;Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution Edited by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; activists such as [[Pauline Léon]] and [[Théroigne de Méricourt]] agitated for full citizenship for women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olwen W pg. 23&quot;&gt;Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution by Olwen W. Hufton pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Women were, nonetheless, &quot;denied political rights of 'active citizenship' (1791) and democratic citizenship (1793).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebel Daughters pg. 79&quot;/&gt;

On 20 June 1792 a number of armed women took part in a procession that &quot;passed through the halls of the Legislative Assembly, into the Tuilleries Gardens, and then through the King's residence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Militant women also assumed a special role in the funeral of [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], following his murder on 13 July 1793. As part of the funeral procession, they carried the bathtub in which Marat had been murdered (by a counter-revolutionary woman) as well as a shirt stained with Marat's blood.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, &quot;Women and the Limits of Citizenship,&quot; p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 1793 women were at the fore of a crowd that demanded &quot;bread and the Constitution of 1793.&quot; When their cries went unnoticed, the women went on a rampage, &quot;sacking shops, seizing grain and kidnapping officials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James H. McMillan, ''France and women, 1789–1914: gender, society and politics'' (Routledge, 2002) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marie-Olympe-de-Gouges.jpg|thumb|[[Olympe de Gouges]] was the author of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' in 1791.]]

The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, a militant group on the far left, demanded a law in 1793 that would compel all women to wear the tricolour cockade to demonstrate their loyalty to the Republic. They also demanded vigorous price controls to keep bread – the major food of the poor people – from becoming too expensive. After the Convention passage law in September 1793, the Revolutionary Republican Women demanded vigorous enforcement, but were counted by market women, former servants, and religious women who adamantly opposed price controls (which would drive them out of business ) and resented attacks on the aristocracy and on religion. Fist fights broke out in the streets between the two factions of women.

Meanwhile, the men who controlled the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers. At this point the Jacobins controlled the government; they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, and decreed that all women's clubs and associations were illegal. They sternly reminded women to stay home and tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men. Organised women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after October 30, 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Darline Gay Levy, Harriet Branson Applewhite and Mary Durham Johnson, eds. ''Women in Revolutionary Paris, 1789–1795'' (1981) pp. 143–49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prominent women===
[[Olympe de Gouges]] wrote a number of plays, short stories, and novels. Her publications emphasised that women and men are different, but this shouldn't stop them from equality under the law. In her &quot;Declaration on the Rights of Woman&quot; she insisted that women deserved rights, especially in areas concerning them directly, such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Gouges Writings 564–568&quot;&gt;De Gouges &quot;Writings&quot; 564–68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madame Roland]] (a.k.a. Manon or Marie Roland) was another important female activist. Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation. She focused on other aspects of the government, but was a feminist by virtue of the fact that she was a woman working to influence the world. Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy; in addition, she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins, a political group which allowed women to join. As she was led to the scaffold, Madame Roland shouted &quot;O liberty! What crimes are committed in thy name!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dalton, &quot;Gender and the Shifting Ground of Revolutionary Politics: The Case of Madame Roland,&quot; ''Canadian journal of history'' (2001) 36#2 pp. 262–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these activists were punished for their actions. Many of the women of the Revolution were even publicly executed for &quot;conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Beckstrand, ''Deviant women of the French Revolution and the rise of feminism'' (2009) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-revolutionary women===
A major aspect of the French Revolution was the [[dechristianisation]] movement, a movement strongly rejected by many devout people. Especially for women living in rural areas of France, the closing of the churches meant a loss of normalcy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hufton, Olwen pg. 106-107&quot;&gt;Olwen Hufton, ''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' (1992) pp. 106–07&lt;/ref&gt;

When these revolutionary changes to the Church were implemented, it sparked a counter-revolutionary movement among women. Although some of these women embraced the political and social amendments of the Revolution, they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and the formation of revolutionary cults like the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].&lt;ref&gt;Desan p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; As Olwen Hufton argues, these women began to see themselves as the &quot;defenders of faith&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hufton, Olwen pg. 303&quot;&gt;Hufton, Olwen. &quot;In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.&quot; 1998 p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; They took it upon themselves to protect the Church from what they saw as a heretical change to their faith, enforced by revolutionaries.

Counter-revolutionary women resisted what they saw as the intrusion of the state into their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hufton, Olwen pg. 104&quot;&gt;Hufton, ''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' (1992) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Economically, many peasant women refused to sell their goods for [[assignats]] because this form of currency was unstable and was backed by the sale of confiscated Church property. By far the most important issue to counter-revolutionary women was the passage and the enforcement of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] in 1790. In response to this measure, women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic. These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Olwen Hufton, &quot;In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.&quot; 1998 pp. 303–04&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic policies==

[[Image:France-500Livres-1790-uni.jpg|thumb|300px| Early ''Assignat'' of 29 Sept, 1790: 500 [[French livres|livres]]]]
[[Image:The value of assignats(1789-1796).png|thumb|right|The value of Assignats (1789–96)]]

The French Revolution abolished many of the constraints on the economy that had slowed growth during the ancien regime. It abolished tithes owed to local churches as well as feudal dues owed to local landlords. The result hurt the tenants, who paid both higher rents and higher taxes.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. G. Sutherland, &quot;Peasants, Lords, and Leviathan: Winners and Losers from the Abolition of French Feudalism, 1780–1820,&quot; ''Journal of Economic History'' (2002) 62#1 pp. 1–24 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2697970 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It nationalised all church lands, as well as lands belonging to royalist enemies who went into exile. It planned to use these seized lands to finance the government by issuing [[assignats]]. It abolished the guild system as a worthless remnant of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;Liana Vardi, &quot;The abolition of the guilds during the French Revolution,&quot; ''French Historical Studies'' (1988) 15#4 pp. 704–17 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/286554 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It also abolished the highly inefficient system of tax farming, whereby private individuals would collect taxes for a hefty fee. The government seized the foundations that had been set up (starting in the 13th century) to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals, poor relief, and education. The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation's charitable and [[History of education in France#Revolution|school systems were massively disrupted.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;in JSTOR&quot;&gt;R.R. Palmer, &quot;How Five Centuries of Educational Philanthropy Disappeared in the French Revolution,&quot; ''History of Education Quarterly'' (1986) 26#2 pp. 181–97 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/368736 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy did poorly in 1790–96 as industrial and agricultural output dropped, foreign trade plunged, and prices soared. The government decided not to repudiate the old debts. Instead it issued more and more paper money (called &quot;assignat&quot;) that supposedly were grounded seized lands.  The result was escalating inflation. The government imposed price controls and persecuted speculators and traders in the black market. People increasingly refused to pay taxes as the annual government deficit increased from 10% of gross national product in 1789 to 64% in 1793. By 1795, after the bad harvest of 1794 and the removal of price controls, inflation had reached a level of 3500%. The assignats were withdrawn in 1796 but the replacements also fuelled inflation.  The inflation was finally ended by Napoleon in 1803 with the franc as the new currency.&lt;ref&gt;Elise S. Brezis and François H. Crouzet, &quot;The role of assignats during the French Revolution: An evil or a rescuer?&quot; ''Journal of European economic history'' (1995) 24#1 pp. 7–40, online.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon after 1799 paid for his expensive wars by multiple means, starting with the modernisation of the rickety financial system.&lt;ref&gt;George Lefebvre, ''Napoleon From 18 Brumaire to Tilsit 1799–1807'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; He conscripted soldiers at low wages, raised taxes, placed large-scale loans, sold lands formerly owned by the Catholic Church, sold Louisiana to the United States, plundered conquered areas and seized food supplies, and levied requisitions on countries he controlled, such as Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Broers|title=The Napoleonic Empire and the New European Political Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2EyFo5PIKcC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=209–12|isbn=9780230241312|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term impact==
{{main article|Influence of the French Revolution}}
The French Revolution had a major impact on Europe and the New World.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: The Struggle, Volume II: The Struggle'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klaits|first1=Joseph|last2=Haltzel|first2=Michael H.|last3=Haltzel|first3=Michael|title=Global Ramifications of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVilfUkW5usC|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge UP}}&lt;/ref&gt; It changed the course of human history, bringing an end to feudalism and making a path for future advances in broadly defined freedom of an individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linda S 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joel Colton 1978 p. 341&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferenc Fehér 1990 pp. 117-30&quot;/&gt;

Otto Dann and John Dinwiddy report, &quot;It has long been almost a truism of European history that the French Revolution gave a great
stimulus to the growth of modern nationalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dann|first1=Otto|last2=Dinwiddy|first2=John|title=Nationalism in the Age of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrujM36H7qUC&amp;pg=PP13|year=1988|publisher=Continuum|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalism was emphasised by historian [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]] as a major result of the French Revolution across Europe. The impact on French nationalism was profound. For example, Napoleon became such a heroic symbol of the nation that the glory was easily picked up by his nephew, who was overwhelmingly elected president (and later became Emperor Napoleon III).&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Fry Hyslop, ''French Nationalism in 1789'' (1968) especially chap. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The influence was great in the hundreds of small German states and elsewhere, where it was either inspired by the French example or in reaction against it.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton J. H. Hayes, ''The Historical Evolution of Modern Nationalism'' (1931), ch 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keitner|first=Chimene I.|title=The Paradoxes of Nationalism: The French Revolution and Its Meaning for Contemporary Nation Building|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MYLwpOJMnUC|year=2007|publisher=SUNY Press|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

The changes in France were enormous; some were widely accepted and others were bitterly contested into the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;John Hall Stewart, ''A Documentary Survey of the french revolution'' (1951) pp. 783–94&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Revolution, the people had little power or voice. The kings had so thoroughly centralised the system that most nobles spent their time at Versailles, and thus played only a small direct role in their home districts. Thompson says that the kings had:
:ruled by virtue of their personal wealth, their patronage of the nobility, their disposal of ecclesiastical offices, their provincial governors (''intendants'') their control over the judges and magistrates, and their command of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Thompson, ''Robespierre and the French Revolution'' (1962) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
After the first year of revolution, this power had been stripped away. The king was a figurehead, the nobility had lost all their titles and most of their land, the Church lost its monasteries and farmlands, bishops, judges and magistrates were elected by the people, the army was almost helpless, with military power in the hands of the new revolutionary National Guard. The central elements of 1789 were the slogan &quot;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity' and &quot;[[The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]&quot;, which Lefebvre calls &quot;the incarnation of the Revolution as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Georges Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&amp;pg=PA212|origyear=1947|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarising politics for more than a century. Historian [[François Victor Alphonse Aulard|François Aulard]] writes:
:From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life.... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aulard in Arthur Tilley, ed. (1922) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religion and charity====
The most heated controversy was over the status of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Kennedy, ''A Cultural History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 145–67&lt;/ref&gt; From a dominant position in 1788, it was almost destroyed in less than a decade, its priests and nuns turned out, its leaders dead or in exile, its property controlled by its enemies, and a strong effort underway to remove all influence of Christian religiosity, such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies. The movement to dechristianise France not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''A Cultural History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 338–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furet, ed., ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution,'' pp. 20–32&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Catholic Church's traditional roles but not its power, its lands or its monasteries. Priests and bishops were given salaries as part of a department of government controlled by Paris, not Rome. Protestants and Jews gained equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Ellis, 'Religion according to Napoleon', in Nigel Aston, ed., ''Religious change in Europe, 1650–1914'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Battles over the role of religion in the public sphere, and closely related issues such as church-controlled schools, that were opened by the Revolution have never seen closure. They raged into the 20th century. By the 21st century, angry debates exploded over the presence of any Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as the headscarves for which Muslim girls could be expelled. J. Christopher Soper and Joel S. Fetzer explicitly link the conflict over religious symbols in public to the French Revolution, when the target was Catholic rituals and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;J. Christopher Soper and Joel S. Fetzer, &quot;Explaining the accommodation of Muslim religious practices in France, Britain, and Germany.&quot; ''French Politics''(2003) 1#1: 39–59; see also {{cite book|author=Abdulkader H. Sinno|title=Muslims in Western Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SD6nUUUKRboC&amp;pg=PT55|year=2009|publisher=Indiana UP|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolutionary government seized the charitable foundations that had been set up (starting in the 13th century) to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals, poor relief, and education. The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation's charitable and school systems were massively disrupted.&lt;ref name=&quot;in JSTOR&quot;/&gt;

In the ancien regime, new opportunities for nuns as charitable practitioners were created by devout nobles on their own estates. The nuns provided comprehensive care for the sick poor on their patrons' estates, not only acting as nurses, but taking on expanded roles as physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. During the Revolution, most of the orders of nuns were shut down and there was no organised nursing care to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;Tim McHugh, &quot;Expanding Women's Rural Medical Work in Early Modern Brittany: The Daughters of the Holy Spirit,&quot; ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' (2012) 67#3 pp. 428–56. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_medicine_and_allied_sciences/v067/67.3.mchugh.html online in project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the demand for their nursing services remained strong, and after 1800 the sisters reappeared and resumed their work in hospitals and on rural estates. They were tolerated by officials because they had widespread support and were the link between elite male physicians and distrustful peasants who needed help.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Léonard, &quot;Femmes, Religion et Médecine: Les Religieuses qui Soignent, en France au XIXe Siècle,&quot; ''Annales: Economies, Societes, Civilisations'' (1977) 32#5 pp. 887–907&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economics====
Two thirds of France was employed in agriculture, which was transformed by the Revolution. With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands, rural France became more a land of small independent farms. Harvest taxes were ended, such as the tithe and seigneurial dues, much to the relief of the peasants. Primogeniture was ended both for nobles and peasants, thereby weakening the family patriarch. Because all the children had a share in the family's property, there was a declining birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P. M. Jones|title=The Peasantry in the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4x9_2uIoroC&amp;pg=PA252|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=251–54, 265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''A decade of revolution, 1789–1799'' (1934) pp. 277–78&lt;/ref&gt; Cobban says the revolution bequeathed to the nation &quot;a ruling class of landowners.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Cobban, ''The social interpretation of the French Revolution'' (1964) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cities, entrepreneurship on a small scale flourished, as restrictive monopolies, privileges, barriers, rules, taxes and guilds gave way. However, the British blockade virtually ended overseas and colonial trade, hurting the port cities and their supply chains. Overall, the Revolution did not greatly change the French business system, and probably helped freeze in place the horizons of the small business owner. The typical businessman owned a small store, mill or shop, with family help and a few paid employees; large-scale industry was less common than in other industrialising nations.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Cobban, ''The social interpretation of the French Revolution'' (1964) pp. 68–80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutionalism====
The Revolution meant an end to arbitrary royal rule, and held out the promise of rule by law under a constitutional order, but it did not rule out a monarch. Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system (although he remained in full control), and the restored Bourbons were forced to go along with one. After the abdication of Napoleon III in 1871, the monarchists probably had a voting majority, but they were so factionalised they could not agree on who should be king, and instead the [[French Third Republic]] was launched with a deep commitment to upholding the ideals of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Furet, ed., ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution,'' pp. 479–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tombs, &quot;Inventing politics: from Bourbon Restoration to republican monarchy,&quot; in Martin S. Alexander, ed., ''French history since Napoleon'' (1999), pp. 59–79&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative Catholic enemies of the Revolution came to power in [[Vichy France]] (1940–44), and tried with little success to undo its heritage, but they kept it a republic. Vichy denied the principle of equality and tried to replace the Revolutionary watchwords &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot; with &quot;Work, Family, and Fatherland.&quot; However, there were no efforts by the Bourbons, Vichy or anyone else to restore the privileges that had been stripped away from the nobility in 1789. France permanently became a society of equals under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R. Hanson|title=Contesting the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsCf8Q0xqO4C&amp;pg=PA189|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communism===
The Jacobin cause was picked up by [[Marxism|Marxists]] in the mid-19th century and became an element of [[Communism|communist thought]] around the world. In the [[Soviet Union]], &quot;Gracchus&quot; [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]] was regarded as a hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents of Marxism: The Founders, the Golden Age, the Breakdown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUCxpznbkaoC&amp;pg=PA152|year=1978|publisher=W.W. Norton|pages=152–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside France===
{{main article|Influence of the French Revolution}}

====Britain====
Britain saw minority support but the majority, and especially the elite, strongly opposed the French Revolution. Britain led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815, and then restored the Bourbons. [[Edmund Burke]] was the chief spokesman for the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Vincent Macleod, ''A War of Ideas: British Attitudes to the War against Revolutionary France, 1792–1802'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: The Struggle, Volume II'' (1970) pp. 459–505&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, the effect was to transform what had been an attempt by Protestant settlers to gain some autonomy into a mass movement led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]] involving Catholics and Protestants. It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland, especially in Ulster. The upshot was a revolt in 1798, led by [[Wolfe Tone]], that was crushed by Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Pelling|title=Anglo-Irish Relations: 1798 1922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttSsGEWW3tcC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=5–10|isbn=9780203986554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
German reaction to the Revolution swung from favourable to antagonistic. At first it brought liberal and democratic ideas, the end of gilds, serfdom and the Jewish ghetto. It brought economic freedoms and agrarian and legal reform. Above all the antagonism helped stimulate and shape German nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodore S. Hamerow|title=Restoration, Revolution, Reaction: Economics and Politics in Germany, 1815–1871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPNXfV2-DhcC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1958|publisher=Princeton UP|pages=22–24, 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
{{main article|Helvetic Republic}}
The French invaded Switzerland and turned it into an ally known as the &quot;[[Helvetic Republic]]&quot; (1798–1803). The interference with localism and traditional liberties was deeply resented, although some modernising reforms took place.&lt;ref&gt;Marc H. Lerner, &quot;The Helvetic Republic: An Ambivalent Reception of French Revolutionary Liberty,&quot; ''French History'' (2004) 18#1 pp. 50–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' 2:394–421&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
{{main article|French period}}
[[File:Paul-Jacob Laminit (inc.) Jahann Voeltz (dis.) Combat dans les rues de Gand, novémbre 1789.JPG|thumb|The [[Brabant Revolution]] broke out in the [[Austrian Netherlands]] in October 1789, inspired by the revolution in neighbouring France, but had collapsed by the end of 1790]]
The region of modern-day Belgium was divided between two polities: the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]]. Both territories experienced revolutions in 1789. In the Austrian Netherlands, the [[Brabant Revolution]] succeeded in expelling Austrian forces and established the new [[United States of Belgium|United Belgian States]]. The [[Liège Revolution]] expelled the tyrannical Prince-Bishop and installed [[Republic of Liège|a republic]]. Both failed to attract international support. By December 1790, the Brabant revolution had been crushed and Liège was subdued the following year.

During the Revolutionary Wars, the French invaded and occupied the region between 1794 and 1814, a time known as the [[French period]]. The new government enforced new reforms, incorporating the region into France itself. New rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Nearly everyone was Catholic, but the Church was repressed. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had a government bureaucracy selected by merit.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries: 1780–1940'' (1978) pp. 65–81, 101–02&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antwerp]] regained access to the sea and grew quickly as a major port and business centre. France promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining. In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard A. Cook, ''Belgium'' (2005) pp. 49–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Clark, &quot;Nobility, Bourgeoisie and the Industrial Revolution in Belgium,&quot; ''Past &amp; Present'' (1984) # 105 pp. 140–75; [http://www.jstor.org/stable/650548 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandinavia====
{{main article|History of Denmark#Reforms}}
The Kingdom of Denmark adopted liberalising reforms in line with those of the French Revolution, with no direct contact. Reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organised liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Horstboll, and Uffe Ostergård, &quot;Reform and Revolution: The French Revolution and the Case of Denmark,&quot; ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (1990) 15#3 pp. 155–79&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The Revolution deeply polarised American politics, and this polarisation led to the creation of the [[First Party System]]. In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republican Party]] led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] favoured France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. [[George Washington]] and his unanimous cabinet, including Jefferson, decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war. Washington proclaimed neutrality instead.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Under President [[John Adams]], a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]], an undeclared naval war took place with France from 1798 until 1799, often called the &quot;[[Quasi War]]&quot;. Jefferson became president in 1801, but was hostile to Napoleon as a dictator and emperor. However, the two entered negotiations over the [[Louisiana Territory]] and agreed to the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, an acquisition that substantially increased the size of the United States.

==Historiography==
{{Main article|Historiography of the French Revolution}}

The French Revolution has received enormous amounts of historical attention, both from the general public and from scholars and academics. The views of historians, in particular, have been characterised as falling along ideological lines, with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rude pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] argued that the Revolution was a manifestation of a more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance.&lt;ref&gt;Rude, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Other thinkers, like the conservative [[Edmund Burke]], maintained that the Revolution was the product of a few conspiratorial individuals who brainwashed the masses into subverting the old order—a claim rooted in the belief that the revolutionaries had no legitimate complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Rude, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinking, have emphasised the importance of the peasants and the urban workers in presenting the Revolution as a gigantic [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;Rude, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In general, scholarship on the French Revolution initially studied the political ideas and developments of the era, but it has gradually shifted towards [[social history]] that analyses the impact of the Revolution on individual lives.&lt;ref&gt;Rude, pp. 12–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians until the late 20th century emphasised class conflicts from a largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Soboul, Albert. ''La Révolution française'', pp. 45–48&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, with support from the [[sans-culottes]], who fought to destroy the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George C. Comninel|title=Rethinking the French Revolution: Marxism and the Revisionist Challenge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9HR3ALvUXoC&amp;pg=PA31|year=1987|publisher=Verso|page=31|isbn=9780860918905}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s. By the year 2000 many historians were saying that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca L. : Spang, &quot;Paradigms and Paranoia: How modern Is the French Revolution?&quot; ''American Historical Review'' (2003) 108#1 pp. 119–47. esp page 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Bell, &quot;Class, consciousness, and the fall of the bourgeois revolution.&quot; ''Critical Review'' (2004) 16#2–3 pp. 323–51&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as Spang has shown, there persists a very widespread agreement to the effect that the French Revolution was the watershed between the premodern and modern eras of Western history.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca L. Spang, &quot;Paradigms and Paranoia.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in history. It marks the end of the [[early modern period]], which started around 1500 and is often seen as marking the &quot;dawn of the [[modern history|modern era]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frey, &quot;Preface&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Within France itself, the Revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church, although the two institutions survived despite the damage they sustained. After the collapse of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] in 1815, the French public lost the rights and privileges earned since the Revolution, but they remembered the participatory politics that characterised the period, with one historian commenting: &quot;Thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena: they talked, read, and listened in new ways; they voted; they joined new organisations; and they marched for their political goals. Revolution became a tradition, and [[republicanism]] an enduring option.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians argue that the French people underwent a fundamental transformation in self-identity, evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by [[human rights|rights]] as well as the growing decline in social deference that highlighted the principle of equality throughout the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The Revolution represented the most significant and dramatic challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;RiemerSimon1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riemer|first1=Neal|last2=Simon|first2=Douglas|title=The New World of Politics: An Introduction to Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKa3FTpH49oC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-939693-41-2|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th Century, the revolution was heavily analysed by economists and political scientists, who saw the [[Social class|class]] nature of the revolution as a fundamental aspect in understanding human social evolution itself. This, combined with the egalitarian values introduced by the revolution, gave rise to a classless and co-operative model for society called &quot;[[socialism]]&quot; which profoundly influenced future revolutions in France and around the world.

The '''Conspiracy of the Equals''' ({{Lang-fr|Conjuration des Égaux}}) or '''Society of the Panthéon''' was a faction within the [[French Revolution]] led by [[François-Noël Babeuf]].

== Background ==

It was the attempts of the [[French Directory|Directory]] to deal with the economic crisis that gave Babeuf his historical importance. The new government was pledged to abolish the system by which Paris was fed at the expense of all France, and the cessation of the distribution of bread and meat at nominal prices was fixed for 20 February 1796. The announcement caused the most widespread consternation. Not only were the workmen and the large class of [[proletarian]]s attracted to Paris by the system, but ''[[rentier capitalism|rentiers]]'' and government officials, whose incomes were paid in ''[[Assignat|assignats]]'' on a scale arbitrarily fixed by the government, saw themselves threatened with starvation. The government yielded to the outcry; but the expedients by which it sought to mitigate the evil, notably the division of those entitled to relief into classes, only increased the alarm and discontent.

The universal misery gave point to virulent attacks by Babeuf on the existing order, and gained him a hearing. He gathered around him a small circle of followers known as the ''Societé des égaux'', soon merged with the rump of the [[Jacobin|Jacobin Club]], who met at the [[Panthéon]]; and in November 1795 he was reported by the police to be openly preaching &quot;''[[insurrection]], revolt and the constitution of 1793''&quot;. They were influenced by [[Sylvain Maréchal]], the author of ''Le Manifeste des Egaux'' and a sympathiser of Babeuf.

== Growth ==

For a time the government, while keeping itself informed of his activities, left him alone. It suited the Directory to let the socialist agitation continue, in order to deter the people from joining in any [[House of Bourbon|royalist]] movement for the overthrow of the existing régime. Moreover the mass of the ''ouvriers'', even of extreme views, were repelled by Babeuf's bloodthirstiness; and the police agents reported that his agitation was making many converts - for the government. The Jacobin Club refused to admit Babeuf and Lebois, on the ground that they were &quot;''égorgeurs''&quot; (&quot;throat-cutters&quot;).

With the development of the economic crisis, however, Babeuf's influence increased. After the club of the Panthéon was closed by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] on 27 February 1796, his aggressive activity redoubled. In [[French Revolutionary Calendar|Ventôse and Germinal]] (roughly late winter and early spring) he published, under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' of ''Lalande, soldat de la patrie'', a new paper, the ''Eclaireur du Peuple, ou le Défenseur de Vingt-Cinq Millions d'Opprimés'', which was hawked clandestinely from group to group in the streets of Paris.

At the same time Issue 40 of the ''Tribun'' excited an immense sensation. In this Babeuf praised the authors of the [[September Massacres]] as &quot;deserving well of their country&quot;, and declared that a more complete &quot;2 September&quot; was needed to annihilate the actual government, which consisted of &quot;starvers, bloodsuckers, [[Tyranny|tyrants]], hangmen, rogues and mountebanks&quot;.

The distress among all classes continued; and in March the attempt of the Directory to replace the ''assignats'' by a new issue of ''mandats'' created fresh dissatisfaction after the breakdown of the hopes first raised. A cry went up that [[national bankruptcy]] had been declared, and thousands of the lower class of ''ouvriers'' began to rally to Babeuf's flag. On 4 April 1796, the government received a report that 500,000 people in Paris were in need of relief. From 11 April, Paris was placarded with posters headed ''Analyse de la Doctrine de Baboeuf'' {{sic}}'', Tribun du Peuple'', of which the opening sentence ran: &quot;''Nature has given to every man the right to the enjoyment of an equal share in all property''&quot;, and which ended with a call to restore the Constitution of 1793.

== Fall of the conspiracy ==
Babeuf's song ''Mourant de faim, mourant de froid'' (&quot;Dying of Hunger, Dying of Cold&quot;), set to a popular tune, began to be sung in the ''[[café]]s'', with immense applause; and reports circulated that the disaffected troops of the [[French Revolutionary Army]] in the camp of Grenelle were ready to join an insurrection against the government.

The Directory thought it time to react; the ''bureau central'' had accumulated through its agents, notably the ex-captain Georges Grisel, who had been initiated into Babeuf’s society, complete evidence of a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] for an armed rising fixed for Floréal 22, year IV (11 May 1796), in which Jacobins and socialists were combined. On 10 May Babeuf, who had taken the [[pseudonym]] ''Tissot'', was arrested; many of his associates were gathered by the police on order from [[Lazare Carnot]]: among them were [[Augustin Alexandre Darthé]] and [[Philippe Buonarroti]], the ex-members of the [[National Convention]], [[Robert Lindet]], [[Jean-Pierre-André Amar]], [[Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet (French revolutionary)|Jean-Baptiste Drouet]], famous as the [[postmaster]] of [[Sainte-Menehould]] who had arrested [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] during the latter's ''[[Flight to Varennes]]'', and now a member of the Directory's [[Council of Five Hundred]].

The government crackdown was extremely successful. The last number of the ''Tribun'' appeared on 24 April, although Lebois in the ''Ami du peuple'' tried to incite the soldiers to revolt, and for a while there were rumours of a military rising.

The trial of Babeuf and his accomplices was fixed to take place before the newly constituted high court of justice at [[Vendôme]]. On Fructidor 10 and 11 (27 August and 28 August 1796), when the prisoners were removed from Paris, there were tentative efforts at a riot with a view to rescue, but these were easily suppressed. The attempt of five or six hundred Jacobins (7 September 1796) to rouse the soldiers at [[Grenelle]] met with no better success.

The trial of Babeuf and the others, begun at Vendôme on 20 February 1797, lasted two months. The government for reasons of their own depicted the socialist Babeuf as the leader of the conspiracy, even though people more important than himself were implicated; and his own vanity played admirably into their hands. On Prairial 7 (26 May 1797) Babeuf and Darthé were condemned to death; some of the prisoners, including Buonarroti, were [[Deportation|deported]]; the rest, including Vadier and his fellow-conventionals, were acquitted. Drouet had succeeded in making his escape, according to [[Paul François Jean Nicolas Barras|Paul Barras]], with the connivance of the Directory. Babeuf and Darthé were [[guillotine]]d the next day at Vendôme, Prairial 8 (27 May 1797), without appeal.

== Legacy ==
Although the words &quot;''[[Anarchy|anarchist]]''&quot;and &quot;''[[Communism|communist]]''&quot; did not exist at the time of the conspiracy, they have all been used to describe its ideas by later scholars. The English word &quot;''communism''&quot; was coined by [[Goodwyn Barmby]] in a conversation with those he described as the &quot;disciples of Babeuf&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|communist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3495">The '''Ségur Ordinance of 1781''' was a French law that required French officer candidates to produce proof of having at least four generations of nobility. Philippe Henri and Marquis de Ségur sponsored the law, also receiving support from the minister of war and the French Military council. The ordinance was approved by [[Louis XVI]] on May 22, 1781.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&quot;&gt;Andrews, R. M. (1994). Law, Magistracy, and Crime in Old Regime Paris, 1735-1789. Cambridge Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Preceding the [[French Revolution]], French society had long been split into three &quot;Estates&quot;. The First Estate contained members of the clergy, the Second Estate the [[French nobility]], and the Third Estate the rest of the population. The Second Estate was divided into two subsets: the nobility of the sword and the nobility of the robe.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, W. (2001). Old Regime France. New York, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword, or court, nobility consisted of traditional French nobles who had hereditary connections to chivalric nobility of the [[Middle Ages]]. During the 18th century, their income was fairly static, consisting of profits from agrarian holdings and benefits from military commissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&quot; /&gt; These traditional nobles dominated the French court and considered advancement in the French Army as the highest form of aristocratic achievement.  By contrast, the robe, or civic, nobility were French financiers, merchants, and real estate moguls who achieved political power through monetary advancement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&quot; /&gt; Their status was newly gained relative to that of the sword nobility, often owing their position to personal success and/or intermediate family connections. They did not have the ornate [[genealogy]] of the court nobility.

The chivalric ideology of the established sword nobles naturally clashed with the presence of newer civic nobles who often lent their status to the payouts of high interest loans made to the French government. As civic nobility established generational lines, young civic nobles purchased their way to high ranks in the [[French Army]], angering sword nobility who wished to maintain the exclusivity of officership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Segur&quot;&gt;Segur, L.-P. (1825). Memoirs and recollections of Count Segur: ambassador from France to the courts of Russia and Prussia. London, Henry Colburn.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perception==
The law was met with public outcry from members of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]]. Many saw the ordinance as a way for the Second Estate to shut out the [[Bourgeois]] from army prestige, even though the original intent behind the law was only to exclude other nobles. The law also managed to further facilitate the niche status of robe nobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Segur&quot; /&gt; These rich aristocrats were not bourgeois, yet their lack of long-term patrilineal legacies prevented them from being accepted among the court nobles. The resentment of both the robe nobility and the bourgeois would lead to political allegiances during the National Assembly of 1789-91. The perceived social and political injustice incited by the Ségur Ordinance was a role-player in the French Monarchy's downward spiral in the late 18th century, ultimately leading to the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, S.

'''Prisons of the Reign of Terror''' indicates a process set up under the [[Reign of Terror]], inaugurated after the lawsuit of the dantonists, then set up in a systematic manner, after the vote of the [[Law of 22 Prairial]] ([[:fr:Loi de Prairial|Loi de Prairial]]). There were several &quot;crimes against humanity,&quot; given that the expression indicates neither rebellion nor mutiny, but a concerted plan of physical elimination of innocent prisoners without due process of the law. Some of these manufactured &quot;conspiracies&quot; considered to be criminal, in year III (1795) failed ([[:fr:Abbaye de Port-Royal de Paris|Abbaye de Port-Royal]]), others envisaged were prempted because of the events of [[Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidor 9]], and others still, found their completion 19, 21–22, and 25 messidor, 5–6, and 8 Thermidor year II (7, 9–10, 13, 23–24, and  26 July 1794). [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] and [[Georges Couthon|Couthon]], contrary to one ''Convention thermidorienne'', did share this: they are entirely the work of the [[Committee of General Security]], in connection with some members of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], and particularly [[Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac|Bertrand Barère]] who said to the Convention: &quot;the committee took its measurements and in two months the prisons will be evacuated&quot;.

==Background==
Some members of [[Committee of Public Safety]] and of [[Committee of General Security]] had decided by political calculation, with various ulterior motives, to accentuate Terror by &quot;purging&quot; (it is their word) the prisons of Paris. Those were overflowing since the removal of the provincial revolutionary tribunals, in March 1794—the defendants stopped in the provinces were submitted in Paris, the recrudescence of the orders of arrest launched in Ile-de-France, by the Committee of general security and the &quot;administrative slownesses&quot; of the revolutionary Tribunal of Paris, backed-up by the paperwork, and the need for arguing the charges. Under the law of the 22 Prairal, the alleged conspiracies of prisoners made it possible to go more quickly, and to comb out the prisons. All the prisoners of one or the other of the many Parisian prisons, whatever the reason for their imprisonment - suspects, prevented or already judged, were concerned overall. The alleged conspiracy of [[Bicêtre Hospital|Bicêtre]], which made it possible to get rid, of more than seventy people, from 28 Prairal, until 8 Messidor, assembled by the Committee of general security, and Voulland in particular, with the downstream of [[Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac]], [[Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne]], and [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]], was the first operation of great width assembled after the law of the 22 Pairial. The Osselin deputy, implied in corruption affairs, and who knew something about the corrupt practices of his former colleagues, of the Committee of general security, in particular [[Jean-Pierre-Andre Amar]], and who had avoided capital punishment four months earlier, was one of these victims, from whom they feared revelations. It is Valagnos, a prisoner condemned to irons, and on standby of the deportation who had agreed to bear false witnesses, agreed to come out to charge the defendants at the [[revolutionary Tribunal]].
This business of false conspiracy was followed by &quot;the business&quot; of Luxembourg, a conspiracy whose reality rested, still exclusively, on the false witnesses of individuals who, against various promises, had to deposit with the revolutionary Tribunal, and which sometimes themselves were carried out thereafter.

==Principals==
Ground after the lawsuit of Danton and its co-defendants to the prison of Luxembourg where was the ex-general [[Arthur Dillon (1750-1794)|Arthur Dillon]], [[Lucile Desmoulins]], or [[Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette]], the imaginary conspiracies, revealed and denounced by agents of the political police in the prisons of Paris, put back on an amalgam various unknown people the ones with the others under the same count of indictment - the &quot;rebellion&quot;, to avoid dispersing in the maze of the personal cases. It was the Committee of general security (and in particular [[:fr:Grégoire Jagot|Jagot]] and [[Jean-Pierre-Andre Amar|Amar]] - themselves under the direction of Vadier, Barère, collot d'Hebois and Billaud-Varennes - which was given the responsibility to supervise, and execute this machiavellian plan, in partnership with [[Fouquier-Tinville]], [[:fr:Martial Joseph Armand Herman|Martial Joseph Armand Hermann]], former president of the revolutionary Tribunal now police chief, with the civil administration, and courts, and the citizens [[:fr:Marie Joseph Emmanuel Lanne|Lanne]], and Dupaumier, administrators of police force. All the principals rested on the false witnesses granted, or snatches other prisoners, sometimes of the &quot;false prisoners&quot; who, such Armand and Manini, were sent from prison to prison to obtain confidences or indiscretions of prisoners: for example the practice that certain prisoners had to meet in the cell of one of them, which allowed, if necessary, to suppose that they plotted their escape with an aim of going to cut the throat of the members of the national representatives. With the Court, it was always the same question which was put to the defendants: &quot;Were you informed or not of a conspiracy which existed, (with Luxembourg or another prison according to the cases) and which exists there, in this moment even, and you denounced it?&quot; On the affirmative or the negative, one passed to the next.

==First conspiracy of Luxembourg==
[[Image:LucileDesmoulins.jpg|thumb|250px|Lucile Desmoulins, supposedly conspiring in the plot of the prisons.]]
The first conspiracy of Luxembourg was assembled by part of the Committee of general security to carry out a certain number of people, supposed accessory to Hébert and Danton, without those being able to express publicly, on the true reasons of their presence to the revolutionary Tribunal. This technique which consisted in closing the mouth of the marked &quot;defendant&quot;, with a collective offence of &quot;conspiracy&quot;, under the law of the 22 Prairal, which dispensed with public debates. Joined together are Lucile Desmoulins, and the general Arthur Dillon who had sought to communicate by message from a cell with the other, were joined together and amalgamated with their alleged &quot;accomplices&quot;: Chaumette, Gobel, Francoise Hébert, the Lécuyer general who were charged, by the Court that prisoners themselves were in danger, and died like the Laflotte diplomat, or the comte de Ferrières-Sauvebeuf.

==Second conspiracy of Luxembourg==
One of the administrators of [[:fr:Prison du Luxembourg|Prison of Luxembourg]], Wiltcherich, which had ''fabricated'' the alleged plot of [[Arthur Dillon (1750-1794)|Arthur Dillon]], and of the woman of [[Camille Desmoulins]] Lucile (5 at 13 April 1794) will cooperate again with the Committee of general security in its task with &quot;purging&quot; the prison of Luxembourg of its prisoners. To join together a sufficient number of denunciations and false witnesses, it made sure of collaborators subordinates among whom: *un tailor of Saint-Omer named with the rank of lieutenant of infantry, [[:fr:Pierre Joseph Boyenval|Pierre Joseph Boyenval]] that the revolutionary army had found makes indignant at it and who, imprisoned since the 20 brumaire year II, in Luxembourg, had charged [[Lucile Desmoulins]] and its co-defendants with the revolutionary Tribunal the 24 germinal year IIBoyenval was guillotine with Fouquier-Tinville in 1795;
*Beausire, lampoonist, whose wife - Nicole Leguay, baroness of Oliva - was especially famous to be mixed with [[:fr:Affaire du collier de la reine|Affair of the queen's collar]] (1784–85);
*le counter clerk or carry-key named Joseph Verney;
*an old aide-de-camp of the general Jean-François Carteaux;
*the named Mercies, a robber &quot;good for the gibet&quot;;

The organization however was chapeautée by [[Jean-Pierre-Andre Amar]] of [[Committee of General Security]], which, for this purpose, had on the spot dispatched its Leymerie secretary who acted in concert with the administrator of Faro police force charged with the &quot;research&quot; in the prisons. They thus recruited a certain number of writers of denunciations, and in Luxembourg, the principalLes others named Denis-Michel Julien, Jean-Louis Benoist, old Swiss, ex-police chief of the executive council, in the department of the Eure, Lenain, Antoine Vauchelet, trader, Meunier, Amans, Letellier, Louis Baraguay d'Hilliers, and Jean-Louis All Saints' day Beausire was, of not to doubt, Pierre-Joseph Boyenval besides, the Guyard caretaker, and his assistant the Verney clerk, had order to leave it and come to his own way, to nourish it suitably and to take care that it was as often as possible in liaison with the prisoners men and women. Boyenval was probably the indicator more cooperative the day before of Thermidor 9, it developed a news &quot;conspiracy&quot; of Luxembourg where it was understood that one would sacrifice two hundred people., with an Italian named Manini who prevailed in Saint-Lazare, the ex-count of Tool bag-Sauvebeuf to La Force or Louis-Guillaume Armand which had work with Holy-Pelagie for the account of [[Dossonville]], principal agent of the Committee of general security, itself invested of quasi-unlimited capacities. Joined together &quot;in council&quot;, the four collaborators, &quot;brigands&quot;, consulted each other so as to draw up a list of names. This was not only the titles of nobility which appointed the prisoners but also ''resentments, whims or love''. Such conspired because he had refused to let one of the four men be useful in his snuffbox, such other because he was not generous with the counter clerk, a third because he was the husband of a woman that Boyenval condescended to find pleasant. This one for example had registered on the list of condemned, the one named Gant whose wife was also locked up in the prison of Luxembourg. He deposited against Gant and the evening, he was with the feet of the frightened woman; two days after, one saw him giving the arm to that from which he came to send the husband to the guillotine.'' When the number of conspirators had reached the number of 154, one stopped. The list was dispatched by the Committee of general security with [[Fouquier-Tinville]]. Contrary to the wishes of [[Bertrand Barère]] which wanted to consider the presumedly conspiry of the prison of Luxembourg, only once, they were distributed by Armand Hermann in three groups that were judged, after law the 22 Prairal year II - without debates and means of defense - in three meetings. In the parts given to the public prosecutor several denunciations, some not very detailed, as the others. That of Verney was to even be used for the alleged third conspiracy of Luxembourg which took place ten days later, Thermidor 4 year II. It was thus conceived:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I undersigned Joseph Verney, carry-key at the prison of Luxembourg, declare that there still exists in this house of the accomplices of the conspiracy of Dillon, Simon, Boisgelin and above the marshal's wife de Lévis (...) and that its accomplices mainly are named… the&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(a list of name follows). And he adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I attest moreover than named Beausire, Boyenval, Amans and Vauchelet, is in the case of to attest that all these individuals are truly the accomplices of this conspiracy, even the principal agents. In Paris, 22 messidor, etc&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===First meeting – 19 messidor (7 July 1794)===
In front of [[revolutionary Tribunal]] the procedure was led with as much contempt, and absence of equity that in the preceding &quot;affaires&quot;, in particular, that of the fifty-four accomplices of the plot of the foreigner that the persecution and execution of the red shirts [Procès et exécution des chemises rouges] to go to the torment. Fifty-nine marked were joined together on the benches of the Court where one asked them to answer by yes or no, the two questions which were asked to them: ''conspired?'' and ''be informed of a conspiracy?''. Fifty-nine people were condemned and guillotined. Among them, an eighty-year-old man: [[:fr:Jean-Baptiste-Augustin de Salignac|Jean-Baptist-Augustin de Salignac]], Abbot of Fénelon. Among the others appeared in particular Denis-Pierre-Jean Papillon of Ferté, above intendant of the menu of the king, Guillaume-Joseph Dupleix de Bacquencourt above intendant of Burgundy, Marc-Antoine-François-Marie Randon of the Tower (administrator of the Treasury), Louis-Joachim-Paris, [[:fr:Potier de Blancmesnil|Louis-Joachim Potier]], duc de Gesvres (compatriot of [[Louis de Saint-Just]]), Charles-Alexandre-Marc-Marcellin de Boussu de Chimay, prince d'Hénin, Aymar-Charles Nicolaï (ex-first chair Room of the Accounts) and [[:fr:Florent-Alexandre-Melchior de La Baume|Florent-Alexandre-Melchior de La Baume]], count of [[:fr:Montrevel-en-Bresse|Montrevel-en-Bresse]] [[Château de Lugny]].

===Second meeting – 21 messidor year II (July 9, 1794)===
This second meeting was composed of fifty marked. It had this remarkable thing; that two of the defendants were discharged; one of them admittedly was a 14-year-old child. On the other hand, the great architect Pierre-Louis Black-Desproux was included in this batch without same to be judged.

===Third meeting – 22 messidor year II (July 10, 1794)===
In this meeting which proceeded like the preceding ones, was present Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon - the son of the famous naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], who, when he went up to the scaffold, shouted with reproach: &quot;I am the son of Buffon&quot;. Present also was Jacques-Raoul Caradeuc of Chalotais, son of [[Louis-Rene Caradeuc of Chalotais]], who was then known to be in a state of insanity.

==Third conspiracy of Luxembourg on Thermidor 4 year II (July 22, 1794)==
This last raid in the prison of Luxembourg involved the execution of forty-five people among whom above the duchess of Brissac, the viscountess de Noailles accompanied by her mother, the duchess of Ayen, born [[Henriette-Anne-Louise d'Aguesseau|Henriette d'Aguesseau]] and from her grandmother, the marshal's wife de Noailles, like her great-uncle [[Philippe de Noailles, duc de Mouchy]] and his wife. With them the hurdy-gurdy countess of Lachâtre, [[Louis Charles of the Mound-Ango of Flers|general of Flers]], the Roger citizen of the section of Humanity,

== Last charrettes==
From the 25 messidor year II (July 13, 1794), the figure of the daily victims never went below thirty and reached that of sixty sometimes. All the famous names of [[Ancien Régime]] were reproduced on the list of the defendants. But on these tragic lists were also day laborers, soldiers, and ploughmen.

==Conspiration of Plessis==
This project was a failure – it had there only three condemned to die – thanks to the courage of the Haly caretaker. See the letter of Gourreau quoted by Henri Wallon. See also Coittant p.&amp;nbsp;187: six indicators recruited by Benoist, which had already worked in Luxembourg, namely: Cupif, above inspector of the gardens of Tileries; Anne Cruau, shoe-maker; Charon, old domestic; Schaff, clock and watch maker; Folâtre, old ordering battalion de Bonne-Nouvelle.

==Conspiracy of the Carmelite friars==
[[Image:CarmesConventDoorstep.jpg|thumb|250px|The prison of the Carmelite friars.]]
After the prison of Luxembourg was &quot;purged&quot; by the process, in the same way, they applied it to other houses of detention. It was still the office of Armand Hermann who caused the denunciations. They brought in front of [[revolutionary Tribunal]] the fifty-one prisoners of [[Prison of the Carmelite friars]]. The first prisoners of the prison of the Carmelite friars were judged on Thermidor 5 year II YEAR, and forty-six of them were condemned to die on the vague denunciations of the indicators. Among them: [[Andre-Jean Butcher d' Argis]] (ex-lieutenant particular to Châtelet); [[François-Charles-Antoine d' Autichamps]] (canon with Notre-Dame) and brother of [[the Charles d' Autichamps|Vendean general]]; [[Louis-Marthe de Gouy d' Arsy]] (former deputy with the constituent Assembly); the general [[Alexandre François Marie de Beauharnais]]; Joachim-Charles de Soyecourt; Louis-Armand-Constantin, prince de Rohan-Montbazon; Gilles de Santerre (banking); [[Louis Rene Quentin de Richebourg de Champcenetz|Louis de Champcenetz]] (collaborator with the royalist newspaper '' [[Acts of the Apostles]] ''). The prisoners of the Carmelite friars were shown to have formed the project to escape.

==Conspiracy of Saint-Lazare==
Among the indicators of [[Prison Saint-Lazare]], the prisoners quoted: *Pierre-Athanase Pip-Desgrouettes, former lawyer, itself, on the bolster since his arrest the 2 floréal. It was implied in one of these innumerable blackmails, to the warrant for arrest near suspect rich person, have his fate was between the hands of its former Dossonville accomplice; * Augustin-Germain Jobert the Belgian, who hopelessly sought to escape the scaffold which it menaçaitil was carried out besides on the run on Thermidor 11 year II by the diligence of Barère;
*les citizens Robiquet, Coquerey, Tap and Roger the Point.
The worst, if one can say, came from Manini, who, like Boyenval in Luxembourg, made zeal, preceding the desires of its employers. Besides one closed the eyes on his &quot;indelicacies&quot; because it was notorious that he made &quot;to contribute&quot; prisoners. Several prisoners, like [[Aimee de Coigny]], Montrond, or the former deputy [[Thomas de Treil de Pardailhan]], managed against money, to be made stripe lists of prisoners denounced, little before the series of &quot;lawsuit&quot; in front of the revolutionary Tribunal.

===Meeting of Thermidor 6 year II – (July 24, 1794)===
The prisoners of the prison of Saint-Lazare appeared twice. It was with the first meeting, on July 25, that Fouquier-Tinville made a sadly dreadful pun. [[Marie-Louise of Laval-Montmorency]] old of seventy-two years old, abess of Montmartre, was deaf. [[Jean-Baptiste Coffinhal]], which chaired, having questioned it, she kept silence, and as Fouquier-Tinville addressed the word in his turn to him, one of marked pointed out to him that prevented did not hear. Fouquier-Tinville murmured: &quot;They are good, they are good, we will put on the sentence that she conspired&quot; dully. The writers [[André Chénier|Andre-Marie Chénier]] and [[Jean-Antoine Roucher]] also sat on the docks. With these writers appear the baron [[Frédérik de Trenck]], seventy years old, the former adviser [[Louis Valentine Goëzman de Thurn|Louis-Valentine Goesman]]. Among the twenty-four condemned one still notices the marquis Gratien de Montalembert and of Roquelaure, the duke Charles-Alexandre de Créqui de Montmorency, the count Henri-Joseph de Bourdeille, the brother Joseph Raoul.

===Meeting of Thermidor 8 year II – (July 26, 1794)===
On July 26, 1794, the countess of Mursin, born Isabelle de Pigrais, paralysed, Mrs. Jolly de Fleury born Elisabeth Dubois de Courval; above the countess of Butler; the princess of Monaco; the marquis Louis-Armand-Joseph d' Usson (seventy-four years); the count de Beausset; Desfossés; Nicaut (ex-adviser at the Parliament of Dijon); Athanase-Jean Butcher (secretary of [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]]); Dorothée de Cambon (woman of a former president of the Parliament of Toulouse); the two brothers Trudaine (Charles-Louis and Charles-Michel) and seventeen marked were condemned to death. A second meeting during which were considered defendants imprisoned with above [[:fr:Couvent des oiseaux|convent des oiseaux]] and at the conclusion which condemned were joined together to the twenty-two of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; of Saint-Lazare, changed the full number of the executions envisaged on Thermidor 8 year II, to fifty three. On the fifty three condemned, seven women declared themselves pregnant, and were sent to the old people's home of the revolutionary Tribunal for examination. Several of them, the following day, belonged to the last cart of the Terror which a famous drawing of Raffet illustrates.

==Conspiracy envisaged the day before Thermidor 9==
Among the papers found after Thermidor 9, those intended to inform the lawsuit of Fouquier-Tinville and his consorts, show that other mass executions were envisaged in the following days, while the arrests and imprisonments, were increasingly numerous. All the nobility of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Boulogne and Auteuil, had been captured in raids, and they waited to appear before the revolutionary Tribunal. They had also brought back to Paris, all the prisoners from the prisons of Chantilly, Amiens, and other places. In all, several hundred people languished in the blocked prisons. It was all to be carried out from the political will of Barère, probably on order of certain foreign cabinets, to deprive France of its elites, and to make a bloodless prey, to parcel out like Poland. Contrary to this, that one believed and repeated, the takeover by force of Thermidor 9 year II, in the spirit of Barère, was to make it possible to get rid of Robespierre to continue with more rigour the great project of Terror, and the destruction of the Republic. The &quot;day of the dupes&quot; on Thermidor 9, reversed the course of things, and the members of the joined committees, in the impossibility to continue their crimes, made against misfortune good heart and suddenly joined the Thermidoriens, to make accord with the opinion that, since Terror was stopped on Thermidor 10, it was well the exclusive work of Robespierre and his &quot;accomplices&quot;, in all, a hundred men of Thermidor were carried out, without due process of the law, 10 and 11. They died instead of the hundreds of prisoners who were going to be marked, to conspire in the prisons. The principal houses of detention in which one still erected scaffolding, the day before the chimerical conspiracies, those of Madelonnettes Papiers were found, II, p.&amp;nbsp;417: report/ratio of Faro on a letter &quot;found&quot; in Madelonnettes, revealing the existence of a conspiracy; of Free Port; of Plessis where the Courlet citizen had been requested to make denunciations against his fellows-prisoner to save his head. Other projects were in hand again to the Carmelite friars and even in Luxembourg who still counted to a great number of prisoners lately incarcerated, Olivier Blanc, the last letter, prisons and condemned revolution, Paris, 1984. Outstanding people were planned for this butchery and in particular [[Thomas Paine]], future Mrs. de Fontenay [[Thérésa Tallien]], girl of the Cabarrus banker, it [[marquis de Sade]], [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], the general [[Lazare Hoche]], the countess of Simiane born Aglaé of Damas, friend of Fayette, the painter [[Hubert Robert]], [[Louise Contat|Miss Contat]] of the French Comedy, it [[duchess d' Orleans]], etc.

==Bilan==
The most tested prisons were Luxembourg (315 executions 19,20, and 21 messidor then on Thermidor 4), Saint-Lazare (165 executions Thermidor 6,7 and 8), Bicêtre 76 executions 28 prairal, and 8 messidor, the Carmelite friars (49 executions on Thermidor 5). All the victims of the conspiracy of the prisons were buried in [[Picpus Cemetery]].

After the fall of [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] Thermidor 9 year II (July 21, 1794) the prisons were opened and the prisoners released.

==Political consequences==
The terror falls with the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]: the responsibility for these crimes projected on the &quot;Robespierrists&quot;.

'''L'armoire de fer''' (French: 'iron chest') refers to a hiding place at the apartments of [[Louis XVI of France]] at the [[Tuileries Palace]] where some secret documents were kept. The existence of this iron cabinet, hidden behind wooden panelling, was publicly revealed in November 1792 to [[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Platière|Roland]], Girondin Minister of the Interior. The resulting scandal discredited the King.

==History==

A locksmith by the name of François Gamain helped reveal these documents to the authorities, who rewarded him with a government pension. The cabinet hid correspondence between Louis XVI and, among others, [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], whose venality and duplicity were exposed. Also, the cabinet included the correspondence of the King with the financier [[Maximilien Radix de Sainte-Foix]], an important secret advisor of the sovereign; with the bankers Joseph Duruey, and Tourteau de Septeuil; with [[Arnaud II de La Porte|Arnaud Laporte]], a Royalist government minister who controlled large funds of money during the revolution; with [[François de Bonal]], [[Bishop of Clermont]], et al.

Most of the pieces of correspondence in the cabinet involved ministers of Louis XVI ([[Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin|Montmorin]], [[Claude Antoine de Valdec de Lessart|Valdec Lessart]], [[Bertrand de Molleville]], [[Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara|Count of Narbonne]], [[Cahier de Gerville]], [[Charles François Dumouriez]], et al.).

Other letters involved prominent figures of the Revolution, such as [[Antoine Joseph Santerre|General Santerre]], [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], [[Antoine Rivarol]], and [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]]. There were rumors that only selected documents were made public, and that certain other documents were destroyed. The Interior Minister Roland would have played a role in this regard, and may have destroyed documents involving his colleague [[Georges Danton|Danton]]. 

These documents, despite the likely gaps and pre-selection, showed the duplicity of advisers and ministers&amp;mdash;at least those that Louis XVI trusted&amp;mdash;who had set up parallel policies.

==Aftermath==
After the discovery of the ''armoire de fer'', Mirabeau's remains were removed from the [[Panthéon, Paris|Pantheon]]. On 20 November 1792, Jean-Marie Roland filed these archives&amp;mdash;at least what was left of them (which was considerable)&amp;mdash;with the office of the [[National Convention]], negating all maneuvers to prevent putting Louis XVI on trial.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Mathiez , La Révolution française, vol. 2: «La Gironde et la Montagne», Ch. 4 : «Le procès du roi»&lt;/ref&gt; By the order of the Convention of 6 December 1792, many of these documents were published by the national printing office in 1792–1793.

The '''Conciergerie''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃sjɛʁʒəʁi}}) is a building in [[Paris]], France, located on the west of the [[Île de la Cité]] (literally &quot;Island of the City&quot;), formerly a prison but presently used mostly for law courts. It was part of the former royal palace, the [[Palais de la Cité]], which consisted of the Conciergerie, [[Paris Hall of Justice|Palais de Justice]] and the [[Sainte-Chapelle]]. Hundreds of prisoners during the [[French Revolution]] were taken from the Conciergerie to be executed by [[guillotine]] at a number of locations around Paris.

==The Middle Ages==
[[File:Hall of men at arms.jpg|thumb|The Hall of the Guards, one of the largest surviving medieval parts of the Conciergerie.]]

The west part of the island was originally the site of a [[Merovingian]] palace, and was known initially as the Palais de la Cité. From the 10th to the 14th centuries it was the main palace of the medieval [[Kings of France]]. During the reigns of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (Saint Louis) (1214–1270) and [[Philippe IV of France|Philippe IV]] (Philip the Fair) (1284–1314) the Merovingian palace was extended and fortified more extensively.

Louis IX added the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] and associated galleries, while Philippe IV created the towered facade on the Seine river side and a large hall. Both are excellent examples of French religious and secular architecture of the period. The [[Sainte-Chapelle]] was built in the French royal style to house the [[crown of thorns]] that was brought back from the Crusades and to serve as a royal chapel. The &quot;Grande Salle&quot; (Great Hall) was one of the largest in Europe, and its lower story, known as &quot;La Salle des Gens d'Armes&quot; (The Hall of the Soldiers) survives at 64m long, 27.5m wide and 8.5m high. It was used as a dining room for the 2,000 staff members who worked in the palace. It was heated with four large fireplaces and lit by many windows, now blocked. It was also used for royal banquets and judicial proceedings. The neighboring Salle des Gardes was used as an antechamber to the Great Hall immediately above, where the king held his ''[[lit de justice]]'' (a session of [[parliament]] in the king's presence).

The early [[House of Valois|Valois]] kings continued to modify the palace during the 14th century, but [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] abandoned the palace during 1358, relocating across the river to the [[Louvre Palace]]. The palace continued to serve an administrative function and still included the chancellery and French Parliament. In the king's absence, he appointed a concierge to command of the palace, a fact which gave the palace its eventual name. During 1391, part of the building was converted for use as a prison and took its name from the ruling office. Its prisoners were a mixture of common criminals and political prisoners. In common with other prisons of the time, the treatment of prisoners was dependent on their wealth, status and associates. Wealthy or influential prisoners usually got their own cells with a bed, desk and materials for reading and writing. Less-well-off prisoners could afford to pay for simply furnished cells known as ''pistoles'', which would be equipped with a rough bed and perhaps a table. The poorest, known as the ''pailleux'' from the ''paille'' (hay) that they slept on, would be confined to dark, damp, vermin-infested cells known as ''[[oubliette]]s'' (literally &quot;forgotten places&quot;). In keeping with the name, they were left to live or die in conditions that were ideal for the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and other infectious diseases, which were rife in the unsanitary conditions of the prison.

Three towers survive from the medieval Conciergerie: the Caesar Tower, named in honor of the Roman Emperors; the Silver Tower, named for its alleged use as the store for the royal treasure; and the Bonbec (&quot;good beak&quot;) Tower, named for the torture chamber that it housed, in which victims were encouraged to &quot;sing&quot;. The building was extended during the reigns of later kings with France's first public clock's being installed about 1370. The current clock dates from 1535. 

==The Conciergerie and the Reign of Terror==

Despite lasting only ten months, the [[Reign of Terror]] (September 1793-July 1794) had a profound effect on France. More than 40,000 people died from execution and imprisonment, and France would not be a republic again for nearly half a century.

The National Convention enacted the Law of Suspects on September 17, 1793. This act declared that anyone considered a counterrevolutionary or enemy of the republic was guilty of treason and, thus, condemned to death. The Revolutionary Tribunal was set up in the Palace of Justice. The two fates for those sent before the tribunal were acquittal or death, with no possibility of appeal. [[Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville]], a radical, was named public prosecutor. The Tribunal sat in the Great Hall between 2 April 1793 and 31 May 1795 and sent nearly 2,600 prisoners to the guillotine.

The Conciergerie prison became the main penitentiary of a network of prisons throughout Paris, and was the last place of housing for more than 2,700 people, who were summarily executed by guillotine. The dank dungeons were a stark contrast to the beautiful architecture of the palace above. The quality of life of the prisoners was based mainly on their personal wealth and the whims of the jailers. The revolutionary period continued the prison's tradition of interning prisoners based on wealth, such that wealthier prisoners could rent a bed for 27 livres 12 sous for the first month, 22 livres 10 sous for subsequent months. Even when the price was decreased to 15 livres, the commanders of the prison made a fortune: as the Terror escalated, a prisoner could pay for a bed and be executed a few days later, freeing the bed for a new inmate who would then pay as well. One memoirist termed the Conciergerie &quot;the most lucrative furnished lodgings in Paris&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Riouffe, Honoré, ed. ''Revolutionary Justice Displayed: Or, An inside View of the Various Prisons of Paris, under the Government of Robespierre and the Jacobins''. Philadelphia: Printed for Benjamin Davies, No, 68, High-Street, by Richard Folwell, No. 33, Mulberry-Street., 1796. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Only celebrity prisoners were assigned cells to themselves. Most of the ''pistole'' inmates were stuffed into a single room that abutted a local hospital, making disease an inevitability. The cramped cells were infested with rats, and the stench of urine permeated every room.

All the prisoners, except those locked in the dungeons, were allowed to walk about the prisoners' gallery from 8 a.m. to an hour before sunset. Roll call was always a tortuous proceeding because many of the jailers were illiterate and it could take hours for them to confirm that all of the prisoners were accounted for. A principal jailer, who sat by the door, determined whether visitors would be allowed inside the prison. His decision depended more on his mood than any set proceedings. He was also in charge of resolving disputes between jailers and their charges.

Trials and executions progressed in a rapid, unpredictable manner; one could be tried by the court and executed before the next morning. The condemned would be walked through the Salle de la Toilette, where their personal belongings were confiscated. Carts loaded them in the May Courtyard and brought them to guillotines throughout Paris, the most famous in the [[Place de la Concorde]].

Famous prisoners include [[Marie Antoinette]], poet [[André Chénier]], [[Charlotte Corday]], [[Madame Élisabeth]], [[Madame du Barry]] and the 21 [[Girondins]], purged at the beginning of the Terror. [[Georges Danton]] later awaited his execution here, and, during the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] himself was interned for a brief time before his execution.

==Post-Revolution and present==
After the [[Restoration of the Bourbons]] during the 19th century, the Conciergerie continued to be used as a prison for high-value prisoners, most notably the future [[Napoleon III]]. Marie Antoinette's cell was converted into a chapel dedicated to her memory. The Conciergerie and Palais de Justice underwent major rebuilding during the mid-19th century, drastically altering their external appearance. While the building looks like a brooding medieval fortress, this appearance actually only dates from about 1858. A description from 1825 gives this impression of the structure before the rebuilding:

{{quote|text=The buildings which form this prison still retain the hideous character of feudal times. The ''préau'' presents a kind of area or court, one hundred and eighty feet in length by sixty in breadth, round which is a gallery leading to the cells, and communicating by stairs to the upper storeys. It was partly constructed in the thirteenth century, and partly rebuilt in modern times, and is ten or twelve feet below the level of the adjacent streets; it serves as a ''promenade'' for the prisoners. The dungeons, which have not been used for the last thirty years, are twenty-three feet in length by eleven and a half in height.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Paris, from the Earliest Period to the Present Day'' Paris: A. and W. Galignani and Co., vol. II, 1825; reprint New York City: Ulan Pess, 2012. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7TAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA371 371].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Conciergerie was decommissioned during 1914 and opened to the public as a national historical monument. It is presently a popular tourist attraction, although only a relatively small part of the building is open to public access; much of it is still used for the Paris law courts.

A '''liberty pole''' is a tall wooden pole, often used as a type of flagstaff, planted in the ground, surmounted by a [[Phrygian cap]]. The symbol originated in the immediate aftermath of the assassination of [[Roman dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] by a group of Rome's Senators in 44 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goldsworthy. ''Caesar: Life of a Colossus''. Paperback edition. London, England, UK: Phoenix, 2007. Pp. 596-619.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after Caesar was killed, the leaders of the assassination plot went to meet a crowd of Romans at the [[Roman Forum]]; a [[pileus (hat)|pileus]] (a kind of skullcap that identified a freed slave) was placed atop a pole to symbolize that the Roman people had been freed from the rule of Caesar, which the assassins claimed had become a tyranny because it overstepped the authority of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and thus betrayed the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goldsworthy. ''Caesar: Life of a Colossus''. Paperback edition. London, England, UK: Phoenix, 2007. Pp. 619.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[French revolution]], the Roman pileus was confused with the [[Phrygian cap]], and this mis-identification then led to the use of the Phrygian cap as a symbol of [[republicanism]].

==American Revolution==
[[File:Freiheitsbaum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A liberty pole on the [[Moselle]] river (modern [[Luxembourg]]) in 1793, drawn by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]]]
Liberty poles were often erected in town squares in the years before and during the [[American Revolution]] (e.g. [[Concord, Massachusetts]]; [[Newport, Rhode Island]]; [[Auriesville, New York|Caughnawaga, New York]]; [[Savannah, Georgia]] and [[Englewood, New Jersey]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofenglewood.org/content/1445/2257/default.aspx Historic Englewood] City of Englewood&lt;/ref&gt;). Some colonists erected liberty poles on their own private land{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}{{Or|date=January 2012}} (such as in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]] since 1964 and [[Woburn, Massachusetts]]—the pole raising there is reenacted annually{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}). An often violent struggle over liberty poles erected by the [[Sons of Liberty]] in [[New York City]] raged for 10 years. The poles were periodically destroyed by the [[Province of New York|royal authorities]] (see the [[Battle of Golden Hill]]), only to be replaced by the Sons with new ones. The conflict lasted from the repeal of the [[Stamp Act]] in 1766 until the revolutionary [[New York Provincial Congress]] came to power in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;[http://independence.nyhistory.org/item.php?item_no=8 Resistance and Dissent : Independence &amp; its Enemies in New York]&lt;/ref&gt; The liberty pole in New York City had been crowned with a gilt vane bearing the single word, &quot;Liberty&quot;.

In some locales&amp;mdash;notably in [[Boston]]&amp;mdash;a liberty tree rather than a pole served the same political purpose.

During the [[Siege of Boston]] on August 1, 1775, a tall liberty pole was erected on [[Union Square (Somerville)|Prospect Hill]], a fortified high-ground overlooking the road to British-occupied Boston.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/paulluntsdiaryma1872lunt#page/8/mode/2up Journal kept by continental soldier Lieutenant Paul Lunt, May-December 1775 ''&quot;raised the mast that came out of the schnoner that was burnt at Chelsea, for to hoist our flag upon, in the fort upon Prospect Hill&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Both the ''&quot;Appeal to Heaven&quot;'' [[Pine Tree Flag]] and [[Grand Union Flag]] (aka Continental Colors) are reported to have flown on Prospect Hill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-washington?specfile=/texts/english/washington/fitzpatrick/search/gw.o2w&amp;act=surround&amp;offset=4584786&amp;tag=Writings+of+Washington,+Vol.+4:+To+JOSEPH+REED+Cambridge,+January+4,+1776.+&amp;query=union+flag&amp;id=gw040192 The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources 1745-1799, Vol. 4: To JOSEPH REED Cambridge, January 4, 1776.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lunt's Diary, Lieutenant Paul Lunt, May–December 1775, Tuesday, July 18, 1775, ''&quot;Our standard was presented in the midst of the regiments with this inscription upon it, &quot;Appeal to Heaven.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; The 76' long liberty pole was originally a ship's mast that had been recently captured&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longfellowfriends.org/journal/journal.php Revolutionary War Soldier's Journal/Diary in the Longfellow House Collections, Moses Sleeper, Tuesday, August 1st, 1775 ''&quot;Raised the mast that Came out of the Schooner that was burnt at Chelsa&quot;'' ].&lt;/ref&gt; from the British armed schooner [[HMS Diana (1775)]], in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Chelsea Creek]] on May 27 and 28, 1775.

When an [[ensign]] was raised (usually red) on a liberty pole, it would be a calling for the Sons of Liberty or townspeople to meet and vent or express their views regarding British rule.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}{{Or|date=January 2012}} The pole was known to be a symbol of [[dissent]] against Great Britain. The symbol is also apparent in many seals and [[coats of arms]] as a sign of liberty, freedom, and independence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], locals in western [[Pennsylvania]] would erect [[Fort Gaddis|poles]] along the roads or in town centers as a protest against the federal government's tax on distilled spirits, and evoke the spirit embodied by the liberty poles of decades earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhiskeyRebs&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The ''{{lang|fr|arbres de la liberté}}'' (&quot;liberty trees&quot;) were a symbol of the [[French Revolution]], the first being planted in 1790 by a pastor of a [[Vienne]] village, inspired by the 1765 [[Liberty Tree]] of Boston. One was also planted in front of the City Hall of  [[Amsterdam]] on 4 March 1795, in celebration of the alliance between the French Republic and the [[Batavian Republic]]. In 1798, with the establishment of the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]], a liberty tree was planted in Rome's [[Piazza delle Scole]], to mark the legal abolition of the [[Roman Ghetto]]. After resumption of Papal rule, the Vatican reinstated the Roman ghetto.

The image of Liberty holding a pole topped by a [[Phrygian cap]] appears on many mid- and late-19th-century U.S. silver coins. These are broadly classified as [[United States Seated Liberty coinage]].

In 1945, following the liberation of the Netherlands from [[German occupation of the Netherlands|Nazi occupation]] in [[World War II]], a liberty pole was erected on Dam Square in Amsterdam. The form of the permanent [[National Monument (Amsterdam)|National Monument]]  later erected on the spot (a stone pillar) might have been influenced by that pole.

The Pavillon de Flore is in central Paris, on the Right Bank ([[French language|French]]: [[Rive Droite]]) and is connected to the [[Louvre]]. It is directly adjacent to the [[Pont Royal]] on the [[Quai François Mitterrand]] (formerly Quai du Louvre, renamed on October 26, 2003), which is between the Passerelle Léopold-Sédar Senghor and the [[Pont du Carrousel]].

===Henry IV and the Grand Design===
The Pavillon de Flore was part of a larger plan, devised during the reign of  [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]], to connect the [[Palais du Louvre]] and [[Palais des Tuileries]] via two long wings at their north and south ends. First, the Petite Galerie, running south from the Palais du Louvre to the [[River Seine]], was connected to the Grande Galerie. The latter was constructed east to west along the Seine until it reached the Tuileries, where it was terminated with the Pavillon de Flore, at the time, known as the Gros Pavillon de la Rivière (&quot;Large River Pavilion&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Aulanier 1971, p. 8. The pavilion was also referred to as the &quot;gros pavillon du bout vers la rivière ou, du bout vers les galeries.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of the pavilion was laid in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;Ballon 1991, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Its design has traditionally been assigned to [[Jacques Androuet II du Cerceau]], who is also thought to have designed the adjacent western section of the Grande Galerie. (The design of the eastern section of the Grande Galerie is traditionally assigned to [[Louis Métezeau]].)&lt;ref&gt;Ballon 1991, pp. 39–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Palais des Tuileries was extended south from the Pavillon Bullant to the Pavillon de Flore via the Petite Galerie des Tuileries. Work on the Grand Design was abandoned following the assassination of Henry IV in 1610.&lt;ref name=&quot;Database&quot;/&gt; However, by this time, the building of the Grande Galerie, the Petite Galerie des Tuileries, and the Gros Pavillon de la Rivière had been completed. (In the 19th century, a second long gallery, matching the Grande Galerie, was constructed from west to east along the [[Rue de Rivoli, Paris|Rue de Rivoli]], from the Pavillon de Marsan at the north end of the Palais des Tuileries to the north end of an expanded Palais du Louvre, finally completing Henry IV's Grand Design.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Outlines&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Coit Gilman|author2=Harry Thurston Peck |author3=Frank Moore Colby |title=The New International Encyclopaedia|publisher=Dodd, Mead and company|page=622|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVArAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA525&amp;lpg=PA525&amp;dq=pavillon+de+flore+structure+building+history&amp;source=web&amp;ots=1hKJdT4awP&amp;sig=_jjsjh6d1koIVhe4_oIW-HYb-os#PPA622,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis XIV===
King [[Louis XIV]] danced in [[Isaac de Benserade]]'s ''Ballet royal de Flore'' in February 1669 at the Tuileries, possibly in the Salle des Ballets located on the first floor of the pavilion. It has been suggested that this is when the name Pavillon de Flore came into use, although the earliest known written mention is in 1726.&lt;ref&gt;Aulanier 1971, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Pavillon de Flore is the name used today, although other names have been used in between.&lt;ref name=&quot;Database&quot;/&gt;

===Marie Antoinette===
For several years, the apartments of [[Marie Antoinette]] were located within the structure.

===French Revolution===
During the [[French Revolution]], the Pavillon de Flore was renamed Pavillon de l'Égalité (House of Equality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Histoire politique et littéraire de la presse en France avec une introduction historique sur les origines du journal et de la bibliographie générale des jounaux depuis leur origine, Tome sixième|author=Eugène Hatin|authorlink=Eugène Hatin|page= 151|publisher=Poulet-Malassis et de Broise libraires-éditeurs|location= 9, rue des Beaux-Arts, Paris|year=1860|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under its new name, it became the meeting point for several of the Committees of the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWQBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA114&amp;lpg=RA1-PA114&amp;dq=pavillon+de+flore+committee&amp;source=web&amp;ots=trEgbHonNB&amp;sig=pyZXTAbl4tVOvCxV7PW9ULdk5C0#PRA1-PA115,M1|title=Royal Palaces and Parks of France|author=Francis Miltoun|publisher=L.C.

Notable occupiers included the Monetary Committee, the Account and Liquidation Examination Committee. However, the most famous was the [[Committee of Public Safety]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Critical&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTgEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=pavillon+de+flore+committee#PPA67,M1|title=Critical Miscellanies|author=John Morley|year=1908|publisher=Macmillan|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee of Public Safety]] ({{lang-fr|Comité de salut public}}) was the principal and most renowned body of the Revolutionary Government, forming the ''de facto'' executive branch of France during the [[Reign of Terror]]. Run by the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] under [[Robespierre]], the group of twelve centralized denunciations, trials, and executions. The committee was responsible for the deaths of thousands, mostly by [[guillotine]].

===The Third Republic and later===
The ruins of the Tuileries Palace were pulled down in 1882 during the [[French Third Republic]]. The Pavillon de Flore and the Pavillon de Marsan are the only portions of the Palais des Tuileries complex still in existence.  

The destruction of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the [[Arc de Triomphe]], as it could now be seen that the two structures were not on the same axis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuileries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Les Tuileries: Rétablir deux grandes perspectives|work=Pourquoi Reconstruire?|publisher=Comité National pour la reconstruction des Tuileries|url=http://www.tuileries.org/page.php?id=retablir.grandes.perspectives|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise the fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the [[Axe historique]]&lt;ref&gt;Before 1871, the east–west axis of the Palais des Tuileries made the center of its façade the perfect starting point of the ''Axe historique''. However, after the destruction of the palace, the head of the axis fell upon the Palais du Louvre, not on its center but thrown off 6.33°, the angle difference between the axes of the two palaces. But, since the Axe historique was in line with the equestrian statue of Louis XIV which stands in the Cour Carrée of the Louvre, the statue became the new starting point of the Axe historique. For a number of reasons, the axis of the ''Grande Arche de La Défense'' happens to have followed the discrepancy of the Louvre: ''The Arche is turned at an angle of 6.33° on this axis, a peculiarity which has been explained by several theories. In particular the architect is said to have wanted to emphasise the depth of the monument, while the specific angle was chosen to create symmetry with the similarly-skewed Louvre.''&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the ''Voie Triomphale''), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the [[Place de la Concorde]], [[Champs-Élysées]], the Arc de Triomphe and the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de La Défense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuileries&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3994">The '''Pension Belhomme''' was a prison and private clinic during the [[French Revolution]].

Around 1765, the [[joiner]] [[Jacques Belhomme]] took on the construction of a building for the son of a neighbour, an aristocrat who had been mad since birth. Seeing that running an asylum was more lucrative than joinery, he opened an asylum for lunatics, old people and whoever else rich families wanted to entrust to him. A famous precursor of psychiatry, [[Philippe Pinel]], carried out his first treatments of the insane here.

Once the [[French Revolution]] had begun, Jacques Belhomme thought that his fortune was assured. Remote from the violent centre of Paris, he had noticeable advantages.  In September 1793 the députés encouraged the [[sans-culotte]]s to imprison all suspect individuals: nobles, their wives and children, foreigners, priests, lawyers, the actors of the [[Comédie Française]], rich people in general, in short, all those who had not made clear their allegiance to the Republic. With the prisons of Paris already overflowing, the state requisitioned Belhomme's asylum and then all other private clinics. Belhomme entreated the 12 police chiefs in charge of Paris to send him rich prisoners who would pay high fees to live in his asylum as comfortably as possible.  From then on marquises, bankers, journalists, famous actors, old nobles and army officers, along with other disgraced persons who bribed the doctors and police chiefs to be transferred on the pretext of illness, lived cheek by jowl with the mad.

Belhomme rented the neighbouring building, the hôtel de Chabanais, to which he linked his own building by a charming garden after the young marquis de Chabanais, a descendant of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], had emigrated with his mother and had his possessions confiscated by the state. Belhomme ended up buying the house to invest the money he had made.  It was in this setting that there occurred the romance between [[Jacques-Marie Rouzet]], a deputy to the [[National Convention]], and [[Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon]], widow of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|duc d’Orléans]] and mother of the future King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]]. They married in secret after leaving prison.

The scandal of the Pension Belhomme finally erupted in January 1794. Belhomme was arrested for supplying wine to the inmates and was imprisoned in another ''pension'', at [[Coignard]], where the [[Marquis de Sade]] was also held.  He was found guilty twice and, like the majority of the former inmates of his &quot;clinic&quot;, escaped the guillotine only because the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] ended on [[9 Thermidor]].  Some of the former inmates did not escape, however, proving too well-known to pass unnoticed. They included [[Béatrice de Choiseul-Stainville]], duchesse de Gramont, sister of [[Louis XV]]'s famous minister; the duchess of Le Châtelet, daughter-in-law of a famous mistress of [[Voltaire]],&lt;ref&gt;Both to be seen in the film by [[Éric Rohmer|Rohmer]], ''[[l'Anglaise et le Duc]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[fermier général]] [[Jean-Baptiste Magon de La Balue|Magon de La Balue]], guillotined with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, brothers and cousins; and the lawyer [[Simon-Nicholas Henri Linguet]], despite his denunciation of the monarchy, for which he had spent a year in the [[Bastille]] under the ancien regime.

The hôtel de Chabanais was razed in 1953, as was the maison Belhomme in 1973.

[[Image:Prison de l'Abbaye St. Germain, 1831.jpg|thumb|300px|The prison de l’Abbaye in 1831]]
The '''prison de l’Abbaye''' was a [[Paris]] prison in use from 1522 to 1854. The final building was built by Gamard in 1631 and made up of three floors, flanked by two [[turret]]s and an [[échauguette]]. It was the scene of one of the bloodiest episodes of the [[French Revolution]].

Madame Roland, wife of the [[Girondin]] Minister of the Interior [[Jean-Marie Roland de La Platière|Jean-Marie Roland]], was interned here on her first arrest in 1793 before being transferred to [[Sainte-Pélagie Prison|Sainte Pélagie]].

==History==

=== Pre-Revolution ===
It occupied part of the current site of [[boulevard Saint-Germain]] in the corner of the enclosire of [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]. The abbaye dated to the earliest era of Paris, when [[Childebert I]] (on the site of a temple to Isis or Ceres according to legend) founded a monastery dedicated to the Holy Cross and to St [[Vincent of Saragossa]], which later took the name of its administering bishop [[Germain of Paris]]. Its basilica became known as &quot;Saint-Denis of the Merovingians&quot;, since it contained the tombs of Childebert I and others of the dynasty.

=== Massacres ===
[[Image:PrisonAbbayeChapel.jpg|thumb|300px|The abbey chapel in 1793.]]
{{Main|September Massacres}}
&lt;!---
Pendant la [[Révolution française|Révolution]], on y renferma une foule de personnes de toutes conditions, accusées d’opposition au régime qui suivit la chute de la monarchie. Les [[2 septembre|2]] et [[3 septembre]] [[1792]], un groupe de forcenés, conduits par [[Stanislas-Marie Maillard]], dit ''Tappe dur'', y massacrèrent 164 prisonniers, dont 18 prêtres. Parmi les prisonniers, se trouvaient le comte Montmorin de St-Hérem, l’abbé Lenfant, [[Cazotte]] et [[Charles François de Virot de Sombreuil]]. 

De toutes les prisons de Paris qui furent le cadre des [[Massacres de septembre|massacres de septembre 1792]], comme la prison voisine des [[Prison des Carmes|Carmes]], celle de l’Abbaye est, en un certain sens, la plus marquante comme lieu de profanation. Dans cette prison plus de 300 personnes furent tuées dans des conditions qui dépassent l’entendement, victimes de la folie meurtrière d’une cinquantaine d’énergumènes conduites par [[Stanislas-Marie Maillard]], qui était pourtant supposé les maîtriser. À l’Abbaye, on avait fait du massacre un spectacle. On avait entassé des vêtements au milieu de la cour pour en faire une sorte de matelas. La victime, lancée de la porte dans cette sorte d’arène, était passée de sabre en sabre et tombait sur le « matelas » trempé et retrempé de sang. Les spectateurs s’intéressaient à la manière dont chacun courait, criait et tombait. Ils relevaient le courage ou, au contraire, la lâcheté qu’avait montré telle ou telle vicime, et semblaient juger en connaisseurs. Les femmes, surtout, prenaient un grand plaisir : leur première répugnance passée, elles devenaient des spectatrices terribles, insatiables, comme furieuses de plaisir et de curiosité. Les massacreurs avaient installé des bancs, des bancs pour les messieurs, des bancs pour les dames.
---&gt;

=== Destruction ===
The prison de l’Abbaye was later transformed into a military prison and was finally demolished in 1854 for the construction of boulevard Saint-Germain.

[[Image:Le Manège sur le plan de Turgot.jpg|right|thumb|225px|The ''Salle du Manège'' on the [[plan de Turgot]]]]
[[Image:Salle du Manège 1.jpg|right|thumb|225px|The ''Salle du Manège'' during the [[French Revolution]]]]

The indoor [[riding academy]] called the '''''Salle du Manège''''' was the seat of deliberations during most of the [[French Revolution]], from 1789 to 1798.

Before the revolution, the Salle du Manège (&quot;Riding Hall&quot;), situated along the north end of the Tuileries Gardens to the west of the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris, was home to the royal equestrian academy. Built during the minority of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], when it lay conveniently close to the Regent's [[Palais Royal]], it was allowed to pass afterwards from hand to hand as the site of privately conducted riding schools, though it was never formally sold.  

On 9 November 1789 the [[National Constituent Assembly]], formerly the [[Estates-General of 1789]], moved its deliberations from Versailles to the Tuileries in pursuit of [[Louis XVI of France]] and installed itself in the ''Salle du Manège'' on the palace grounds. Having nationalised the goods of the Church, the ''Assemblée nationale'', requiring more space than the ''Manège'' alone could provide, extended its occupation to two adjacent convents, those of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], which soon housed the Revolutionary printing presses in its former [[refectory]], and of the [[Feuillant (monks)|Feuillants]], whose handsome library received the archives of the Assemblée.

The proportions of the ''Salle du Manège'', ten times as long as it was wide, offered poor acoustics for the debates that went on continually under its high vaults. Six tiers of banquettes  permitted space for the deputies, ranged on either side of the central tribune, initially planned for the orators' podium. Seated together for solidarity, the deputies seated themselves according to their political opinions, to right and to left of the president's desk, [[The Mountain]] and the [[Girondins]], with The Plain seated in the lowest rank of banquettes, from which they were wont to cross to the opposite side, as their opinions dictated. The public found places to witness the spectacle at either end of the hall and in the loge seats above.

In 1792 the ''Salle du Manège'' became the venue for the [[National Convention]]. In 1795 under the [[French Directory]], the [[Council of 500]] sat in the structure until the body moved to the [[Palais-Bourbon]] in 1798. In 1799, the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin ''Club du Manège'']] had its headquarters there.

It would seem that 19th century references to the art of &quot;manège,&quot; to describe a style of equestrian riding, derive from here.  A March 1847 edition of [[The Illustrated London News]] described a performance of [[Pablo Fanque]], the 19th century equestrian and circus performer thus: &quot;This extraordinary feat of the manège has proved very attractive, as we anticipated in our Journal of last week; and we have judged the success worthy of graphic commemoration...&quot;  Further, the paper said, &quot;Mr. Pablo has trained his black mare to do the most extraordinary feats of the manege, an art hitherto considered to belong only to the French and German professors of equitation, and her style certainly far exceeds anything that has ever yet been brought from the Continent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Illustrated London News,&quot; March 20, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Square du Temple''' is a garden in [[Paris, France]] in the  [[3rd arrondissement of Paris|3rd arrondissement]], established in 1857.  It is one of 24 city squares planned and created by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]] and [[Jean-Charles Alphand]].  The Square occupies the site of a medieval [[fortress]] in [[Paris]], built by the [[Knights Templar]].  Parts of the fortress were later used as a [[prison]] during the [[French Revolution]], and then demolished by the mid 19th century.

==History==

===Knights Templar===

The Knights Templar began in the 12th century, constructing a fort first (Vieux Temple or Old Temple) in [[Le Marais]]. In the 13th century, a new fortress was built as their European headquarters.  The enclosure, called ''enclos du Temple'', originally featured a number of buildings important to the running of the Order, and included a church and a massive turreted [[keep]] known as ''Grosse Tour'' (great tower), and a smaller tower called ''Tour de César'' (Caesar's Tower).

The location of the towers is drawn on the floor in front of the town hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;ll=48.863773,2.361481&amp;z=33|title=Google Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rue Eugene Spuller. The heavy doors of the Grosse Tour still exist and are kept at [[Château de Vincennes]] whose great keep, attributed to Raymond du Temple, is speculated to have been inspired by the nearby Templar fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorentz|first=Phillipe|authorlink=|author2=Dany Sandron |title=Atlas de Paris au Moyen Âge|publisher=Parigramme|year=2006|location=Paris|isbn=2-84096-402-3|page=238 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===

The Temple is also known for having been the [[France|French]] royal family's jail at the time of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. Members of the royal family imprisoned at the Temple's tower were:

* [[King Louis XVI]], from 13 August 1792 to 21 January 1793, then he was taken to be [[guillotine]]d at the [[Place de la Révolution]];
* [[Marie Antoinette]], from 13 August 1792 to 1 August 1793 in the Temple's tower, then she was taken to the [[Conciergerie]], from where she eventually was also taken to the guillotine;
* [[Madame Élisabeth]], who stayed for 21 months at the tower before being taken on 9 May 1794 to the Conciergerie and guillotined the following day;
* [[Louis XVII]], from 13 August 1792 until his death of tuberculosis at the tower on 8 June 1795, at the age of ten;
* [[Princess Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte|Princess Marie-Thérèse]], who stayed at the tower for three years and four months before being sent into exile.

===Demolition===

In 1808 the Temple having become a place of [[pilgrimage]] for [[House of Bourbon|royalist]]s, [[Napoleon]] ordered its demolition, which took two years. Remnants were demolished around 1860 under orders from [[Napoleon III]].

==Today==

Today its location is a [[Temple (Paris Métro)|station]] of the [[Paris Metro]], serving the [[carreau du temple]] (covered market) and the Palais de Justice (Courthouse) of the third arrondissement.

The garden includes a gazebo, a playground for children, lawns with the largest open to the public from April 15 to October 15, fountains and a pond with an artificial waterfall, on rocks from the forest of Fontainebleau. The grid surrounding the square was designed by the architect Gabriel Davioud.  The square contains almost 200 varieties of plants, including many exotic species, such as hazel, a [[Ginkgo biloba]], a [[Honey Locust of America]], a ptérocaryer Caucasus, [[goldenrain tree]], [[Cedrela]], and [[Chinese quince]].

In 2007, the square has been awarded the &quot;ecological green spaces&quot; awarded by [[ECOCERT]], the international organic certification.

There are two statues. One represents the songwriter [[Pierre-Jean de Béranger]], who lived on the nearby street, which later took his name.  This is the second in his image: a first bronze statue, due to Amédée Doublemard was erected by public subscription opened in 1879 by the newspaper La Chanson and destroyed in 1941. It was replaced in 1953 by the present statue in stone, Henri Lagriffoul.

Another statue is made of a bust on a pedestal, which is registered &quot;At B. Wilhelm founder 1781-1842 The Orphéon French&quot;, above a medallion portrait and the text&quot; To Eugene Delaporte propagator 1818-1886 &quot;.

On 26 October 2007, a monument was inaugurated on the lawn of the main square of the Temple. It carries the names, names and ages of 85 &quot;little ones who do not have time to attend school,&quot; Jewish children from 2 months to 6 years living in the 3rd arrondissement and deported between 1942 and 1944 and then murdered in [[Auschwitz]].  This monument was unveiled in the presence of several hundred people, the elect of the district and the city and representatives of associations, the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France.  The memorial is one of several honoring the 11,400 Jewish children deported from France.  The lists of children were compiled from school and civic records by [[Serge Klarsfeld]].

A '''Temple of Reason''' (French: ''Temple de la Raison'') was, during the [[French Revolution]], a temple for a new belief system created to replace [[Christianity]]: the [[Cult of Reason]], which was based on the ideals of reason, virtue, and liberty. This &quot;religion&quot; was supposed to be universal and to spread the ideas of the revolution, summarized in its &quot;[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]&quot; motto, which was also inscribed on the Temples.

==Services==

The symbols of Christianity were covered up and they were replaced by the symbols of the Cult of Reason. In the Churches of Reason, there were specially created services that were meant to replace the [[Christian liturgy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrick&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Fête de la Raison 1793.jpg|thumb|Feast of Reason, at the Notre-Dame]]
For instance, at the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, on November 10, 1793, a special ritual was held for the &quot;Feast of Reason&quot;: the nave had an improvised mountain on which stood a Greek temple dedicated to Philosophy and decorated with busts of philosophers. At the base of the mountain was located an altar dedicated to Reason, in front of which was located a torch of Truth. The ceremony included the crowd paying homage to an actress dressed in blue, white, red (the colours of the Republic), personifying Liberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrick&quot;&gt;James A. Herrick, &quot;The Making of the New Spirituality&quot;, InterVarsity Press, 2004 ISBN 0-8308-3279-3, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churches transformed into Temples of Reason==

After Catholicism was banned in 1792, many of its churches were turned into Temples of Reason, including:

* the [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] Cathedral (November 10, 1793)
* the [[Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Chartres]],
* [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris]] 
* [[Église Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis]]
* the [[basilique Saint-Denis de Saint-Denis|basilique Saint-Denis]],
* the church of [[Les Invalides]],
* the church of Thomas d'Aquino,
* the [[Panthéon de Paris]],
* the church Saint Pierre from Montmartre,
* the [[Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Reims]],
* the [[Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Troyes]],
* the Notre Dame de Versailles Church,
* [[Église Saint-Pierre de Caen]],
* and many others

'''Tuileries Palace''' ({{lang-fr|Palais des Tuileries}}, {{IPA-fr|palɛ de tɥilʁi|IPA}}) was a royal and imperial [[palace]] in [[Paris]] which stood on the [[Rive Droite|right bank]] of the River [[Seine]]. It was the usual Parisian residence of most [[List of French Monarchs|French monarchs]], from [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] to [[Napoleon III]], until it was burned by the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871.

Built in 1564, it was gradually extended until it closed off the western end of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] courtyard and displayed an immense [[façade]] of 266 metres. Since the destruction of the Tuileries, the Louvre courtyard has remained open and the site is now the location of the eastern end of the [[Tuileries Garden]], forming [[Tuileries Garden#The Terrasse|an elevated terrace]] between the [[Place du Carrousel]] and the gardens proper.

==History==
[[File:Israel Silvestre, Palais de la Reyne Catherine de Medicis - Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Tuileries Palace in the 1600s]]
[[File:Louvre1615.jpg|thumb|The old medieval Louvre (background) and the Tuileries (foreground) linked by the ''Grande Galerie'' along the River Seine, in 1615]]
[[File:Louvre and Tuileries palaces on the map of Turgot 1739 - Kyoto U.jpg|thumb|The Tuileries Palace and the [[Louvre]] on the 1739 [[Turgot map of Paris]], during the reign of [[Louis XV]]]] 
[[File:Plan louvre1.svg|Map of the Louvre and the Tuileries Gardens|thumb|The Tuileries Palace (white) was located at the west end of the modern Louvre, closing off the Louvre courtyard]]

After the accidental death of [[Henry II of France]] in 1559, his widow [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519–1589) planned a new palace. She sold the medieval [[Hôtel des Tournelles]], where her husband had died, and began building the palace of Tuileries in 1564, using architect [[Philibert de l'Orme]]. The name derives from the tile kilns or ''tuileries'' which had previously occupied the site.  The palace was formed by a range of long, narrow buildings. During the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1589–1610), the building was enlarged to the south, so it joined the long riverside gallery, the Grande Galerie, which ran all the way to the older [[Louvre Palace]] in the east.

===Louis XIV===
During the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] major changes were made to the Tuileries Palace. From 1659 to 1661 it was extended to the north by the addition of the [[Théâtre des Tuileries]].&lt;ref&gt;Coeyman 1998, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1664 to 1666 the architect [[Louis Le Vau]] and his assistant [[François d'Orbay]] made other significant changes. They transformed Philibert de l'Orme's facades and central pavilion, replacing its grand central staircase with a colonnaded vestibule on the ground floor and the Salle des Cents Suisses (Hall of the Hundred Swiss Guards) on the floor above and adding a rectangular dome. A new grand staircase was installed in the entrance of the north wing of the palace, and lavishly decorated royal apartments were constructed in the south wing. The king's rooms were on the ground floor, facing toward the Louvre, and the queen's on the floor above, overlooking the garden. At the same time, Louis' gardener, [[André Le Nôtre]], redesigned the Tuileries gardens. The Court moved into the Tuileries Palace in November 1667, but left in 1672, and soon thereafter went to the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;Hautecoeur 1927, pp.  123–142; Devêche 1981, pp. 9–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tuileries Palace was virtually abandoned and used only as a theatre, but its gardens became a fashionable resort of Parisians.

===Louis XV===

The boy-king [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] was moved from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace on 1 January
1716, four months after ascending to the throne. He moved back to Versailles on 15 June 1722, three months before his coronation. Both moves were made at the behest of the Regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|the duc d'Orléans]]. The king also resided at the Tuileries for short periods during the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;Bernier, Oliver, ''Louis The Beloved: The Life of Louis XV'', Doubleday, Garden City, 1984 pp. 12-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis XVI===
[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|left|The storming of the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792 and the massacre of the Swiss Guard]]
On 6 October 1789, during the [[French Revolution]], [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and his family were [[Women's March on Versailles|forced to leave Versailles]] and brought to the Tuileries where they were kept under surveillance. For the next two years the palace remained the official residence of the king.

On 9 November 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly]], formerly the [[Estates-General of 1789]], had moved its deliberations from the tennis court at Versailles to the Tuileries, following the removal of the court to Paris. The Tuileries' covered riding ring, the [[Salle du Manège]] (which ran along the north end of the Tuileries Gardens to the west of the palace), home to the royal equestrian academy, provided the largest indoor space in the city.

The royal family tried to escape after dark, on 20 June 1791, but were [[Flight to Varennes|captured at Varennes]] and brought back to the Tuileries. The following year, on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], the palace was stormed by an armed mob, which overwhelmed and massacred the [[Swiss Guard]] as the royal family fled through the gardens and took refuge with the Legislative Assembly.  The Paris National Guard defended the King, but the daughter of King Louis XVI claimed that many of the guard were already in favor of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, Margaret R. &quot;Tuileries Palace Attacked, August 10, 1792.&quot; Forging Freedom: The Life of Cerf Berr of Médelsheim. N.p.: n.p., n.d. 344. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1792, the [[Armoire de fer]] incident took place at the Tuileries palace. This was the discovery of a hiding place at the royal apartments, believed to contain the secret correspondence of Louis XVI with various political figures. The incident created a considerable scandal that served to discredit the King.

===Revolutionary France===
The Tuileries accommodated the Constituent Assembly, its successor, the [[National Convention]], and, in 1795, the [[Council of Five Hundred]] (''Conseil des Cinq-Cents'') of the [[Directoire]] until the body moved to the [[Palais-Bourbon]] in 1798. In 1799, the ''[[Jacobin Club]] du Manège'' had its headquarters there. The [[Committee of Public Safety]] met in the [[Pavillon de Flore#Committee of Public Safety|Pavillon de Flore]]. A courtier of a later era could summon up nightmarish visions of the palace's [[Théâtre des Tuileries|Salle de Spectacle]], or theater, where many Convention sessions were held during the [[Reign of Terror]]:

At night a single lamp illumined this huge deserted hall, peopled with terrible memories. These I would often muse over as I stopped at the spot once occupied by the chair of the president, where [[François Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas|Boissy d'Anglas]] had saluted the bleeding head of {{ill|Jean-Bertrand Féraud|lt=Feraud|fr}}, and where [[Jacques-Alexis Thuriot de la Rosière|Thuriot]] had listened impassively to the outburst of [[Maximilien de Robespierre|Robespierre]] at bay: &quot;President of assassins, once more I ask your ear !&quot; I saw in imagination the &quot;[[The Mountain|Mountain]],&quot; the &quot;[[The Plain|Plain,&quot; the &quot;Marsh]],&quot; and the crowded tribunes; I fancied I could hear the shrieking clamour of the &quot;[[tricoteuses]]&quot; and the drums of the &quot;[[Revolutionary sections of Paris|sections]]&quot; hastening to the attack or to the rescue of the [[National Convention|Assembly]]; and I would call up one or other of the acts of the mighty drama of which this sinister hall has been the scene.|
[[Augustin Filon]]|Recollections of the Empress Eugénie|&lt;ref name=filon1920pp126-127 /&gt;}}

===Napoleon===
[[File:Hippolyte Bellangé - Un jour de revue sous l’Empire - 1810.jpg|thumb|Military review in front of the Tuileries in 1810, by [[Hippolyte Bellangé]]. The [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]], which can be seen on the right of this painting, used to be the entrance gate of the palace of the Tuileries and, with the [[Pavillon de Flore]], is all that remains, above ground, of the palace at the site.]]

When [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] [[French Consulate|came into power in 1799]], he made the Tuileries the official residence of the First Consul and, later, the [[First French Empire|imperial palace]]. In 1808, Napoleon began constructing the northern gallery which also connected to the Louvre, enclosing a vast square (''place'').

As [[Napoleon I]]'s chief residence, the Tuileries Palace was redecorated in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[Empire style]] by [[Charles Percier|Percier]] and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Fontaine]] and some of the best known architects, designers, and furniture makers of the day.

In 1809, [[François-Honoré-Georges Jacob-Desmalter|Jacob-Desmalter]], principal supplier of furniture to the Emperor, began work on a jewel cabinet designed for the Empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]'s great bedroom in the Tuileries (and soon to be used by Marie-Louise). Designed by the architect Charles Percier, this impressive piece of furniture was embellished with several gilt-bronze ornaments: the central panel depicts the &quot;Birth of the Queen of the Earth to whom Cupids and Goddesses hasten with their Offerings&quot; by the ''bronzier'' [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]], after a bas-relief by [[Antoine-Denis Chaudet|Chaudet]]. Jacob-Desmalter completed the &quot;great jewelry box&quot; in 1812, with two smaller items of furniture in the same style but using woods from rainforests in China.

After Napoléon's divorce, [[Pierre Paul Prud'hon]] was commissioned to design the apartments of his new wife, [[Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria|Marie-Louise]].  For the bridal suite of the new Empress he designed all the furniture and interior decorations in a Greek Revival style.

===Restoration===
The Tuileries Palace became the royal residence at the time of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] from 1814 to 1830. During the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, the palace was attacked for a third time by an armed mob and occupied. The Swiss Guards stationed at the palace, aware of what had happened in 1792 to their predecessors, abandoned the palace. King [[Louis Philippe I]] took up permanent residence there until 1848, when it was again invaded on 24 February.

After the ''coup d'état'' by [[Napoléon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] in 1852, the Tuileries Palace served as the official residence of the executive branch of government, and when President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte became Emperor Napoléon III, he moved from his office at the [[Élysée Palace]] to the Tuileries.

===The Second Empire===
[[File:PierreTetarVanElvenFêteAuxTuileries10juin1867.JPG|thumb|Gala soirée of 10 June 1867, for sovereigns attending the International Exposition of that year, by [[Pierre Tetar van Elven]]. The exterior horseshoe staircase, from the garden to the Salle de Maréchaux, was temporarily erected for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fête de nuit aux Tuileries le 10 juin 1867, à l'occasion de la visite de souverains étrangers à l'exposition universelle |url=http://www.carnavalet.paris.fr/en/collections/fete-de-nuit-aux-tuileries-le-10-juin-1867-l-occasion-de-la-visite-des-souverains |website=[[Carnavalet Museum]] |department=Paintings |language=French |access-date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the Second Empire, the Tuileries was extensively refurbished and redecorated after the looting and damage that occurred during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolution of 1848]]. Some imposing state rooms were designed and richly decorated, serving as the center stage of the ceremonies and pageantry of the Second Empire, such as on the occasion of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s state visit to France in 1855. The Second Empire also completed the northern wing of the Louvre along the ''[[rue de Rivoli]]'', linking the Tuileries Palace with the rest of the Louvre, and thus finally achieving the huge complex of the Louvre-Tuileries, whose master plan had been envisioned three centuries earlier. Previously, the [[Place du Carrousel]] had been swept clear of the old houses that had encroached on it.

The prominent roof-lines of the palace and especially its squared central dome were influential prototypes in the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire style]] adopted for hotels and commercial buildings as well as residences in the United Kingdom and North America.

====Interior====

The private apartment used by [[Napoleon III]], on the ground floor of the southern wing of the palace, consisted of &quot;overheated gilt boxes furnished in the style of the First Empire&quot;, being kept at &quot;an excessively high temperature&quot; by the emperor. [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] had her apartment above, connected to the emperor's by a winding staircase, with a mezzanine occupied by the treasurer of the privy purse in between, and comprising eight of the eleven rooms on the [[piano nobile|bel etage]] of the southern wing's garden side. This arrangement at the Tuileries was unlike at Versailles, where the apartments of monarch and consort were both on the same floor and the king's was the grander of the two.
&lt;ref name=filon1920pp61-74 /&gt;

The state rooms – on the Carrousel, or east, side – of the south wing were used variously depending on the occasion. If it were an informal dinner, the household would gather in the Private Drawing Room, or Salon d'Apollon, which was separated from the Salle de Maréchaux, in the central pavilion, by the First Consul's Room, or Salon Blanc. The party would proceed through the throne room to dinner in the Salon Louis XIV. However, gala dinners were held in the larger Galerie de Diane, the southernmost of the state apartments. If it were a state ball, then refreshments would be set up in the Galerie; and the procession of the imperial party would be from there to the Salle de Maréchaux, which occupied the space of two entire floors of the central Pavillon de L'Horloge and served as the ballroom.
&lt;ref name=filon1920pp61-74&gt;{{cite book |last=Filon |first=Augustin |authorlink=Augustin Filon |title=Recollections of the Empress Eugénie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RR9yAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 |accessdate=4 July 2013 |year=1920|publisher=Cassell and Company, Ltd. |location=London |pages=61–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The little-used northern wing of the palace, which contained the chapel, Galerie de la Paix, and the [[Théâtre des Tuileries|Salle de Spectacle]] would be called into service only for performances, such as the [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] cantata performed the evening of Napoleon and Eugénie's civil wedding ceremony, 29 July 1853,

The Salle de Spectacle was also used as a hospital during the Franco-Prussian War.

The southernmost pavilion, the Pavillon de Flore, served as the backstairs to the palace. Service corridors led to it. One could get from there to the sprawling basement, lit with innumerable gas lamps, where a railway had been set up to bring food from the kitchens under the [[Rue de Rivoli]].

The finalization of the long planned Louvre-Tuileries complex was not to happen. On 23 May 1871, during the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]], 12 men under the orders of Jules Bergeret, the former chief military commander of the Commune, set the Tuileries on fire at 7 p.m., using [[petroleum]], liquid [[tar]] and [[turpentine]]. The fire lasted 48 hours and thoroughly gutted the palace, except for the southernmost part, the Pavillon de Flore&lt;ref name=EB1956V17P293&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=14th |year=1956 |volume=17 |pages=293 |title=Paris |location=Chicago |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the gate of honor, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, also remains, as well as the foundation&lt;ref name=samuel2006 /&gt;). The dome itself was blown up by explosives placed in the central pavilion and detonated by the converging fires. Observing this, Bergeret sent a note to the Committee of Public Safety: 'The last vestiges of Royalty have just disappeared. I wish that the same may befall all the public buildings of Paris'&lt;ref&gt;'Paris under Siege' by Joanna Richardson publ. Folio Society London 1982&lt;/ref&gt; It was only on 25 May that the Paris fire brigades and the 26th battalion of the [[Chasseurs d'Afrique]] managed to put out the fire. The library and other portions of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] were also set on fire by [[Communards]] and entirely destroyed. The museum itself was only miraculously saved.

The ruins of the Tuileries stood on the site for 11 years. Although the roofs and the inside of the palace had been utterly destroyed by the fire, the stone shell of the palace remained intact and restoration was possible. Other monuments of Paris also set on fire by Communards, such as the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|City Hall]], were rebuilt in the 1870s. After much hesitation, the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] eventually decided not to restore the ruins of the Tuileries, which had become a symbol of the former royal and imperial regimes. However, the portions of the Louvre that had also been destroyed by fire were rebuilt in their original style.

===Demolition===
[[File:Punta-Facenord.jpg|thumb|The ''Château de la Punta'' in [[Corsica]] which was partially built with stones from the Tuileries]]

In 1882, the French National Assembly voted for the demolition of the ruins, which were sold to a private entrepreneur for the sum of 33,300 gold francs (approximately US$130,000 in 2005), despite the protests of [[Baron Haussmann]] and other members of French artistic and architectural circles, who opposed what they thought was a crime against French arts and history. The demolition was started in February 1883 and completed on 30 September 1883. Bits of stone and marble from the palace were sold by a private entrepreneur, Achille Picart, as souvenirs, and even to build a castle in [[Corsica]], near [[Ajaccio]], the [[:fr:château de la Punta|château de la Punta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/lapunta/ |title=Le Chateau de la Punta |publisher=Pagesperso-orange.fr |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is essentially a reconstruction of the Pavillon de Bullant. The courtyard pediment of the central pavilion can be seen in Paris' [[:fr:Square Georges-Cain|Georges Cain square]], some courtyard is in the garden of the Trocadero. Other pieces are in the Louvre, the Museum of Decorative Arts, and at schools of architecture, fine arts, and bridges and  roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cg-corsedusud.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/Collectivite_Departementale/Son_Patrimoine/chateau_punta/Chateau_de_la_Punta.pdf |title=Du Pavillon Bullant au Château de la Punta |last1=Van Cappel de Premont |first1=François |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuileries Garden and the ''Axe historique''==
{{Main|Tuileries Garden}}

When the large empty space between the northern and southern wings of the Louvre now familiar to modern visitors was revealed in 1883, for the first time the Louvre courtyard opened into an unbroken ''[[Axe historique]]''. The '''Tuileries Garden''' ({{lang-fr|Jardin des Tuileries}}) is surrounded by the Louvre (to the east), the Seine (to the south), the [[Place de la Concorde]] (to the west) and the [[Rue de Rivoli]] (to the north).

The straight line which runs through the [[Place de la Concorde]] and the [[Arc de Triomphe]] to [[La Défense]] was originally centred on the façade of the Tuileries, a similar line leading across the entrance court of the Louvre. As the two façades were placed at slightly differing angles, this has resulted in a slight 'kink' on the site of the palace a feature ultimately dictated by the curved course of the [[River Seine]].

===Tuileries Garden===
The Tuileries Garden covers about 63 acres (25 hectares) and still closely follows a design laid out by the royal [[landscape architect]] [[André Le Nôtre]] in 1664. His spacious formal garden plan drew out the perspective from the reflecting pools one to the other in an unbroken vista along a central axis from the west façade, which has been extended as the ''[[Axe historique]]''.

The [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] is a museum of contemporary art located in the northwest corner of the gardens.

Since 2003, the ''Comité national pour la reconstruction des Tuileries''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/savoir/grands-chantiers/06/interviews/alain-boumier/presentation-chat.shtml |title=Alain Boumier, président du Comité national pour la reconstruction des Tuileries, en chat sur L'Internaute |language=fr |publisher=Linternaute.com |date=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Le Palais des Tuileries va-t-il renaître de ses cendres ? |trans-title=Will the Tuileries Palace Rise From Its Ashes? |url=http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2349670&amp;rubId=5548 |date=14 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914012331/http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2349670&amp;rubId=5548 |archive-date=14 September 2008 |newspaper=[[La Croix]] |language=French |accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposing to rebuild the Tuileries Palace. This effort is similar to the proposal of reconstruction of the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] (Berlin City Palace). There are several reasons for rebuilding the Palace of the Tuileries. Ever since the destruction of 1883, the famous perspective of the [[Champs-Élysées]], which ended on the majestic façade of the Tuileries Palace, now ends at the ''[[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]]'', formerly centered on the Tuileries but now occupying a large empty space. The Louvre, with its [[Louvre Pyramid|pyramid]] on the one hand, and the [[Axe historique]] of the [[Place de la Concorde]]-[[Champs-Élysées]]-[[Arc de Triomphe]] on the other, are not aligned on the same axis.

The ''Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel'' fortuitously stands near the intersection of the two axes. The Palace of the Tuileries, which was located at the junction of these two diverging axes, helped to disguise this bending of the axes. Architects argue that the rebuilding of the Tuileries would allow the re-establishment of the harmony of these two different axes. The Tuileries Gardens would also recover their purpose, which was to be a palace garden.

Also, it is emphasized that the ''[[Musée du Louvre]]'' needs to expand its ground plan to properly display all its collections, and if the Tuileries Palace were rebuilt the Louvre could expand into the rebuilt palace. It's also proposed to rebuild the state apartments of the Second Empire as they stood in 1871. All the plans of the palace and many photographs are stored at the ''[[Archives nationales (France)|Archives nationales]]''. Furthermore, all the furniture and paintings from the palace survived the 1871 fire because they had been removed in 1870 at the start of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and stored in secure locations.

Today, the furniture and paintings are still deposited in storehouses and are not on public display due to the lack of space in the Louvre. It is argued that recreating the state apartments of the Tuileries would allow the display of these treasures of the Second Empire style which are currently hidden.

===Cost===
In 2006 a rebuilding of the Palace of the Tuileries was estimated to cost 300 million euros (US$380 million). The plan was to finance the project by public subscription with the work being undertaken by a private foundation, with the French government spending no money on the project. The French president at that time, [[Jacques Chirac]], called for a debate on the subject. Former president [[Charles de Gaulle]] had also supported reconstruction, saying that it would &quot;make a jewel of the centre of Paris.&quot;&lt;ref name=samuel2006&gt;{{cite news |last=Samuel |first=Henry |title=£200m plan to restore glory of Tuileries Palace |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1526336/200m-plan-to-restore-glory-of-Tuileries-Palace.html |date=14 August 2006 |newspaper=The Telegraph |access-date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5031">The '''Dual Revolution''' was a term first coined by [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. It refers specifically to the time period between 1789 and 1848 in which the political and ideological changes of the [[French Revolution]] fused with and reinforced the technological and economic changes of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The French Revolution, inspired by the ideals of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy, spread ideas of [[Democracy]], [[Nationalism]], and [[Liberalism]]. These political ideas were fused with the new technological advances of the industrial revolution such as the [[spinning jenny]], [[steam engine]]s, and the [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]]. With the defeat of the French Revolution and subsequently the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]] constructed a [[European balance of power|balance of power in Europe]] that would prevent one country from gaining too much power. This set the framework for a strong conservative, reactionary stance against the ideas of nationalism and liberalism spread by the dual revolution. The [[Holy Alliance]], formed by Austria, Prussia and Russia in September 1815 became a symbol of oppression to the ideas spread by the Dual Revolution.

==Industrial Revolution==
Generally, [[Industrial Revolution]] means transitioning from hand produced to machines. In the case of the dual revolution, the Industrial portion was more from social scientists like Count Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, Louis Blanc, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, and Karl Marx who attempted to come up with ideas for “utopias”, conservative and socialist societies.

==French Revolution==
The [[French Revolution]] began in 1789 with the [[Tennis Court Oath]], by which the members of the third estate, who had been locked out of the meeting the estates general, gathered together and swore not to disband until they had written a new constitution. Inspired by the ideas of Enlightenment Philosophers, most prominently [[Rousseau]] and his social contract, the National assembly, those who had sworn the tennis court oath, published the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]]. The Declaration of the Rights of Man was very much an expression of Enlightenment ideals. A major portion of the Declaration was dedicated to the natural rights of man. According to the Declaration every man is entitled to life, liberty and property. This is a reflection of the beliefs of John Locke who wrote the 2nd treatise of civil government. The [[Committee of Public Safety]], headed by [[Robespierre]], which rose to power after using the sans culotte to imprison the other members of the Jacobin club, was based on Rousseau's Social Contracts idea of the general will. Rousseau states that at times people have to sacrifice their natural rights for the greater good which is represented by the [[General Will]]. The General Will is not necessarily represented by the majority, a far-seeing minority can represent the general will. Robespierre believed that the Committee of Public Safety represented the general will. Robespierre used an aggressive revolutionary purge of those who opposed the Committee called the Terror, a planned economy, and French Nationalism inspired by the revolution to increase French military size and push armies into most of western Europe.

===Nationalism===
Nationalism was a driving force for European politics after the French revolution. The ideas of Nationalism emphasized both national pride and that each nation, which consists of a people of the same culture and language should coincide with the boundaries of the state. Metternich, the Austrian Chancellor, was conservative precisely because nationalism was very dangerous to the massive, multi-ethnic Austria. Increased national identity and pride garnered from the successes of ones country were another reason for increased European colonialism during the later parts of the 19th century.

===Liberalism===
Liberalism was a major movement post French Revolution. It was an expression of enlightenment ideals. Liberals believed in freedom of the press, freedom of speech, civil rights, fair elections, capitalism, freedom of religion and private property. Ideas of liberalism greatly influenced the 1848 revolutions which were led by students and the middle class.

===Conservatism===
Conservatism is based on traditional strategies like absolute monarchies. It is a reactionary stance against the ideas spread by the dual revolution. Conservatism is closely linked to Classicism.

The '''Bastille''' ({{IPA-fr|bastij}}) was a [[Castle|fortress]] in Paris, known formally as the '''Bastille Saint-Antoine'''. It played an important role in the internal conflicts of France and for most of its history was used as a state prison by the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. It was [[storming of the Bastille|stormed]] by a crowd on 14 July 1789, in the [[French Revolution]], becoming an important symbol for the French [[History of the Left in France#19th century|Republican movement]], and was later demolished and replaced by the [[Place de la Bastille]].

The Bastille was built to defend the eastern approach to the city of Paris from the English threat in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Initial work began in 1357, but the main construction occurred from 1370 onwards, creating a strong fortress with eight towers that protected the strategic gateway of the [[Porte Saint-Antoine]] on the eastern edge of Paris. The innovative design proved influential in both France and England and was widely copied. The Bastille figured prominently in France's domestic conflicts, including the fighting between the rival factions of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundians]] and the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]] in the 15th century, and the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] in the 16th. The fortress was declared a state prison in 1417; this role was expanded first under the [[Henry V of England|English occupiers]] of the 1420s and 1430s, and then under [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in the 1460s. The defences of the Bastille were fortified in response to the English and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] threat during the 1550s, with a [[bastion]] constructed to the east of the fortress. The Bastille played a key role in the rebellion of the [[Fronde]] and the [[Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine|battle of the faubourg Saint-Antoine]], which was fought beneath its walls in 1652.

[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] used the Bastille as a prison for upper-class members of French society who had opposed or angered him including, after the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]], French [[Protestant]]s. From 1659 onwards, the Bastille functioned primarily as a state penitentiary; by 1789, 5,279 prisoners had passed through its gates. Under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI of France|XVI]], the Bastille was used to detain prisoners from more varied backgrounds, and to support the operations of the Parisian police, especially in enforcing government censorship of the printed media. Although inmates were kept in relatively good conditions, criticism of the Bastille grew during the 18th century, fueled by autobiographies written by former prisoners. Reforms were implemented and prisoner numbers were considerably reduced. In 1789 the royal government's financial crisis and the formation of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] gave rise to a swelling of republican sentiments among city-dwellers. On 14 July the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary crowd, primarily residents of the [[faubourg Saint-Antoine]] who sought to commandeer the valuable gunpowder held within the fortress. Seven remaining prisoners were found and released and the Bastille's governor, [[Bernard-René de Launay]], was killed by the crowd. The Bastille was demolished by order of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Committee of the Hôtel de Ville]]. Souvenirs of the fortress were transported around France and displayed as icons of the overthrow of [[despotism]]. Over the next century, the site and historical legacy of the Bastille featured prominently in French [[July Revolution|revolutions]], political protests and popular fiction, and it remained an important symbol for the French [[History of the Left in France#19th century|Republican movement]].

Almost nothing is left of the Bastille except some remains of its stone foundation that were relocated to the side of the Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered institution, but deeply implicated in the system of French policing and political control during the 18th century.

==History==

===14th century===
[[File:Bastille reconstruction 1420.jpg|thumb|300px|Historical reconstruction showing the moat below the walls of Paris (left), the Bastille and the [[Porte Saint-Antoine]] (right) in 1420]]

The Bastille was built in response to a threat to Paris during the [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France.&lt;ref name=LandsdaleP216&gt;Lansdale, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Bastille, the main royal castle in Paris was the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]], in the west of the capital, but the city had expanded by the middle of the 14th century and the eastern side was now exposed to an English attack.&lt;ref name=LandsdaleP216/&gt; The situation worsened after the [[Ransom of King John II of France|imprisonment of John II]] in England following the French defeat at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|battle of Poitiers]], and in his absence the [[Provost of Paris]], [[Étienne Marcel]], took steps to improve the capital's defences.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1357, Marcel expanded the city walls and protected the [[Porte Saint-Antoine]] with two high stone towers and a {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} ditch.&lt;ref&gt;Viollet, p. 172; Coueret, p. 2; Lansdale, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|An alternative opinion, held by Fernand Bournon, is that the first bastille was a completely different construction, possibly made just of earth, and that all of the later bastille was built under [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] and his son.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} A fortified gateway of this sort was called a &quot;bastille&quot;, and was one of two created in Paris, the other being built outside the [[Porte Saint-Denis]].&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel was subsequently removed from his post and executed in 1358.&lt;ref name=ViolletLandsdaleP218&gt;Viollet, p. 172; Landsdale, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1369, Charles V became concerned about the weakness of the eastern side of the city to English attacks and raids by mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Viollet, p. 172; Landsdale, p. 218; Muzerelle (2010a), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles instructed Hugh Aubriot, the new provost, to build a much larger fortification on the same site as Marcel's bastille.&lt;ref name=ViolletLandsdaleP218/&gt; Work began in 1370 with another pair of towers being built behind the first bastille, followed by two towers to the north, and finally two towers to the south.&lt;ref name=CouereteBournonP3&gt;Coueret, p. 3, Bournon, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress was probably not finished by the time Charles died in 1380, and was completed by his son, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]].&lt;ref name=CouereteBournonP3/&gt; The resulting structure became known simply as the Bastille, with the eight irregularly built towers and linking curtain walls forming a structure {{convert|223|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|121|ft|m}} deep, the walls and towers {{convert|78|ft|m}} high and {{convert|10|ft|m}} thick at their bases.&lt;ref&gt;Viollet, p. 172; Schama, p 331; Muzerelle (2010a), p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Built to the same height, the roofs of the towers and the tops of the walls formed a broad, [[crenellated]] walkway all the way around the fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson, p.208&quot;&gt;Anderson, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the six newer towers had underground &quot;cachots&quot;, or [[dungeon]]s, at its base, and curved &quot;calotte&quot;, literally &quot;shell&quot;, rooms in their roofs.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrisoned by a captain, a knight, eight squires and ten crossbowmen, the Bastille was encircled with ditches fed by the [[River Seine]], and faced with stone.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011; Funck-Brentano, p. 62; Bournon, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress had four sets of drawbridges, which allowed the Rue Saint-Antoine to pass eastwards through the Bastille's gates while giving easy access to the city walls on the north and south sides.&lt;ref&gt;Viollet, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille overlooked the Saint-Antoine gate, which by 1380 was a strong, square building with turrets and protected by two drawbridges of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles V chose to live close to the Bastille for his own safety and created a royal complex to the south of the fortress called the Hôtel St. Paul, stretching from the Porte Saint-Paul up to the Rue Saint-Antoine.&lt;ref&gt;Lansdale, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Bastille can be seen in the background of [[Jean Fouquet]]'s [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Entr%C3%A9e_de_Charles_V_%C3%A0_Paris.jpg 15th-century depiction] of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]'s entrance into Paris.|group=upper-alpha}}

Historian Sidney Toy has described the Bastille as &quot;one of the most powerful fortifications&quot; of the period, and the most important fortification in late medieval Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Toy, p. 215; Anderson, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille's design was highly innovative: it rejected both the 13th-century tradition of more weakly fortified [[quadrangular castle]]s, and the contemporary fashion set at [[Château de Vincennes|Vincennes]], where tall towers were positioned around a lower wall, overlooked by an even taller keep in the centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson, p.208&quot;/&gt; In particular, building the towers and the walls of the Bastille at the same height allowed the rapid movement of forces around the castle, as well as giving more space to move and position cannons on the wider walkways.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson pp. 208, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille design was copied at [[Château de Pierrefonds|Pierrefonds]] and [[Tarascon]] in France, while its architectural influence extended as far as [[Nunney Castle]] in south-west England.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 208–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 15th century the French kings continued to face threats both from the English and from the rival factions of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundians]] and the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]].&lt;ref&gt;Lansdale, pp.219–220.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille was strategically vital during the period, both because of its role as a royal fortress and safe-haven inside the capital, and because it controlled a critical route in and out of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1418, for example, the future [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] took refuge in the Bastille during the Burgundian-led &quot;Massacre of the Armagnacs&quot; in Paris, before successfully fleeing the city through the Porte Saint-Antoine.&lt;ref&gt;Lansdale, p.220; Bournon, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bastille was occasionally used to hold prisoners, including its creator, Hugues Aubriot, who was the first person to be imprisoned there. In 1417, in addition to being a royal fortress, it formally became a state prison.&lt;ref name=CoueretP4&gt;Coueret, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Hugues Aubriot was subsequently taken from the Bastille to the [[For-l'Évêque]], where he was then executed on charges of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, pp.4, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}

Despite the improved Parisian defences, [[Henry V of England]] captured Paris in 1420 and the Bastille was seized and garrisoned by the English for the next sixteen years.&lt;ref name=CoueretP4/&gt; Henry V appointed [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter]], as the new captain of the Bastille.&lt;ref name=CoueretP4/&gt; The English made more use of the Bastille as a prison; in 1430 there was a minor rebellion when some prisoners overpowered a sleeping guard and attempted to seize control of the fortress; this incident includes the first reference to a dedicated gaoler at the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, pp.7, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris was finally recaptured by [[Charles VII of France]] in 1436. When the French king re-entered the city, his enemies in Paris fortified themselves in the Bastille; after a siege, they eventually ran out of food, surrendered and were allowed to leave the city after the payment of a ransom.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bas, p.191.&lt;/ref&gt; The castle remained a key Parisian fortress, but was successfully seized by the Burgundians in 1464, when they convinced royal troops to surrender: once taken, this allowed their faction to make a surprise attack into Paris, almost resulting in the capture of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Lansdale, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bastille was being used to hold prisoners once again by the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], who began to use it extensively as a state penitentiary.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011; Lansdale, p.220; Bournon, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; An early escapee from the Bastille during this period was Antoine de Chabannes, Count of Dammartin and a member of the [[League of the Public Weal]], who was imprisoned by Louis and escaped by boat in 1465.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.13; Bournon, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The captains of the Bastille during this period were primarily officers and royal functionaries; Philippe de Melun was the first captain to receive a salary in 1462, being awarded 1,200 [[French livre|livres]] a year.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, pp.49, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Converting medieval financial figures to modern equivalents is notoriously challenging. For comparison, 1,200 livres was around 0.8% of the French Crown's annual income from royal taxes in 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} Despite being a state prison, the Bastille retained the other traditional functions of a royal castle, and was used to accommodate visiting dignitaries, hosting some lavish entertainments given by Louis XI and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th century===
[[File:Bastille district 1575.jpg|thumb|350px|A depiction of the Bastille and neighbouring Paris in 1575, showing the new [[bastion]]s, the new Porte Saint-Antoine, the [[Arsenal of Paris|Arsenal]] complex and the open countryside beyond the city defences]]

During the 16th century the area around the Bastille developed further. Early modern Paris continued to grow, and by the end of the century it had around 250,000 inhabitants and was one of the most populous cities in Europe, though still largely contained within its old city walls – open countryside remained beyond the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Munck, p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arsenal of Paris|Arsenal]], a large military-industrial complex tasked with the production of cannons and other weapons for the royal armies, was established to the south of the Bastille by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], and substantially expanded under [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]].&lt;ref&gt;Lansdale, p.285.&lt;/ref&gt; An arms depot was later built above the Porte Saint-Antoine, all making the Bastille part of a major military centre.&lt;ref&gt;Muzerelle (2010a), p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1550s, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] became concerned about the threat of an English or [[Holy Roman Empire]] attack on Paris, and strengthened the defences of the Bastille in response.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Bretano, p.61; Muzerelle (2010a), p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The southern gateway into the Bastille became the principal entrance to the castle in 1553, the other three gateways being closed.&lt;ref name=CoueretP4/&gt; A [[bastion]], a large earthwork projecting eastwards from the Bastille, was built to provide additional [[Suppressive fire|protective fire]] for the Bastille and the Arsenal; the bastion was reached from the fortress across a stone [[abutment]] using a connecting drawbridge that was installed in the Bastille's Comté tower.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, pp.45, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1573 the Porte Saint-Antoine was also altered – the drawbridges were replaced with a fixed bridge, and the medieval gatehouse was replaced with a [[triumphal arch]].&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Callot view of the Bastille.jpg|thumb|left|The Bastille in 1647, illustrating the bastion, the stone [[abutment]] linking to the fortress and the new southern entrance built during the 1550s]]

The Bastille was involved in the numerous [[French Wars of Religion|wars of religion]] fought between Protestant and Catholic factions with support from foreign allies during the second half of the 16th century. Religious and political tensions in Paris initially exploded in the [[Day of the Barricades]] on 12 May 1588, when hard-line Catholics rose up in revolt against the relatively moderate [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. After a day's fighting had occurred across the capital, Henry III fled and the Bastille surrendered to [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry]], the [[Duke of Guise]] and leader of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], who appointed Bussy-Leclerc as his new captain.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, p.449.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry III responded by having the Duke and his brother murdered later that year, whereupon Bussy-Leclerc used the Bastille as a base to mount a raid on the ''Parlement de Paris'', arresting the president and other magistrates, whom he suspected of having royalist sympathies, and detaining them in the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, pp.451–2.&lt;/ref&gt; They were not released until the intervention of [[Charles, Duke of Mayenne|Charles]], the [[Duke of Mayenne]], and the payment of substantial ransoms.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, p.452.&lt;/ref&gt; Bussy-Leclerc remained in control of the Bastille until December 1592, when, following further political instability, he was forced to surrender the castle to Charles and flee the city.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, p.459.&lt;/ref&gt;

It took [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] several years to retake Paris. By the time he succeeded in 1594, the area around the Bastille formed the main stronghold for the Catholic League and their foreign allies, including Spanish and Flemish troops.&lt;ref&gt;Freer, p.358.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille itself was controlled by a League captain called du Bourg.&lt;ref&gt;Freer, pp.248, 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry entered Paris early on the morning of 23 March, through the Porte-Neuve rather than the Saint-Antoine and seized the capital, including the Arsenal complex that neighboured the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Freer, pp.354–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille was now an isolated League stronghold, with the remaining members of the League and their allies clustering around it for safety.&lt;ref&gt;Freer, pp.356, 357–8.&lt;/ref&gt; After several days of tension, an agreement was finally reached for this rump element to leave safely, and on 27 March du Bourg surrendered the Bastille and left the city himself.&lt;ref&gt;Freer, pp.364, 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 17th century===

The Bastille continued to be used as a prison and a royal fortress under both Henry IV and his son, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. When Henry clamped down on a Spanish-backed plot among the senior French nobility in 1602, for example, he detained the ringleader [[Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron|Charles Gontaut, the Duke of Biron]], in the Bastille, and had him executed in the courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, p.486.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XIII's chief minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], is credited with beginning the modern transformation of the Bastille into a more formal organ of the French state, further increasing its structured use as a state prison.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.64; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Richelieu broke with Henry IV's tradition of the Bastille's captain being a member of the French aristocracy, typically a Marshal of France such as [[François de Bassompierre]], [[Charles d'Albert]] or [[Nicolas de L'Hospital]], and instead appointed [[François Leclerc du Tremblay|Père Joseph]]'s brother to run the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.64; Bournon, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In practice, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]'s nobles appointed lieuentants to actually run the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} The first surviving documentary records of prisoners at the Bastille also date from this period.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1648, the [[Fronde insurrection]] broke out in Paris, prompted by high taxes, increased food prices and disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Munck, p.212&quot;&gt;Munck, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parlement|''Parlement of Paris'']], the Regency government of [[Anne of Austria]] and rebellious noble factions fought for several years to take control of the city and wider power. On 26 August, during the period known as the First Fronde, Anne ordered the arrest of some of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris; violence flared as a result, and the 27 August became known as another [[Day of the Barricades]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of the Bastille loaded and readied his guns to fire on the ''Hôtel de Ville'', controlled by the parliament, although the decision was eventually taken not to shoot.&lt;ref&gt;Lansdale, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; Barricades were erected across the city and the royal government fled in September, leaving a garrison of 22 men behind in the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Munck, p.212; Le Bas, p.191.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1649, the Fronde decided to take the Bastille, giving the task to Elbeuf, one of their leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Treasure, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; Elbeuf's attack required only a token effort: five or six shots were fired at the Bastille, before it promptly surrendered on the 13 January.&lt;ref&gt;Treasure, p.141; Le Bas, p.191.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Broussel]], one of the Fronde leaders, appointed his son as the governor and the Fronde retained it even after the ceasefire that March.&lt;ref&gt;Treasure, p.171; Le Bas, p.191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bastille 1649.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The Bastille and the eastern side of Paris in 1649]]

During the Second Fronde, between 1650 and 1653, [[Louis, Grand Condé|Louis]], the Prince of Condé, controlled much of Paris alongside the Parlement, while Broussel, through his son, continued to control the Bastille. In July 1652, the [[battle of the Faubourg St Antoine]] took place just outside the Bastille. Condé had sallied out of Paris to prevent the advance of the royalist forces under the command of [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]].&lt;ref&gt;Treasure, p.198.&lt;/ref&gt; Condé's forces became trapped against the city walls and the Porte Saint-Antoine, which the Parlement refused to open; he was coming under increasingly heavy fire from the Royalist artillery and the situation looked bleak.&lt;ref&gt;Sainte-Aulaire, p.195; Hazan, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous incident, [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier|La Grande Mademoiselle]], the daughter of [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans|Gaston]], the Duke of Orléans, convinced her father to issue an order for the Parisian forces to act, before she then entered the Bastille and personally ensured that the commander turned the fortress's cannon on Turenne's army, causing significant casualties and enabling Condé's army's safe withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Sainte-Aulaire, p.195; Hazan, p.14; Treasure, p.198.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1652, Condé was finally forced to surrender Paris to the royalist forces in October, effectively bringing the Fronde to an end: the Bastille returned to royal control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Munck, p.212&quot;/&gt;

===Reign of Louis XIV and the Regency (1661–1723)===
[[File:Bastille 1715.jpg|thumb|350px|The Bastille and Porte Saint-Antoine from the north-east, 1715–19]]

The area around the Bastille was transformed in the reign of Louis XIV. Paris' growing population reached 400,000 during the period, causing the city to spill out past the Bastille and the old city into the arable farmland beyond, forming more thinly populated &quot;[[faubourg]]s&quot;, or suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Trout, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the events of the Fronde, Louis XIV rebuilt the area around the Bastille, erecting a new archway at the Porte Saint-Antoine in 1660, and then ten years later pulling down the city walls and their supporting fortifications to replace them with an avenue of trees, later called Louis XIV's boulevard, which passed around the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.37; Hazan, pp.14–5; ''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille's bastion survived the redevelopment, becoming a garden for the use of the prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XIV made extensive use of the Bastille as a prison, with 2,320 individuals being detained there during his reign, approximately 43 a year.&lt;ref name=BNF1&gt;''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis used the Bastille to hold not just suspected rebels or plotters but also those who had simply irritated him in some way, such as differing with him on matters of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical offences that inmates were accused of were espionage, counterfeiting and embezzlement from the state; a number of financial officials were detained in this way under Louis, most famously including [[Nicolas Fouquet]], his supporters [[Henry de Guénegaud]], Jeannin and [[Lorenzo de Tonti]].&lt;ref&gt;Trout, pp.140–1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1685 Louis [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revoked the Edict of Nantes]], which had previously granted various rights to French Protestants; the subsequent royal crackdown was driven by the king's strongly anti-Protestant views.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille was used to investigate and break up Protestant networks by imprisoning and questioning the more recalcitrant members of the community, in particular upper-class [[Calvinist]]s; some 254 Protestants were imprisoned in the Bastille during Louis's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Cottret, p.73; Trout, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt;

By Louis's reign, Bastille prisoners were detained using a &quot;[[lettre de cachet]]&quot;, &quot;a letter under royal seal&quot;, issued by the king and countersigned by a minister, ordering a named person to be held.&lt;ref name=TroutP142&gt;Trout, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis, closely involved in this aspect of government, personally decided who should be imprisoned at the Bastille.&lt;ref name=BNF1/&gt; The arrest itself involved an element of ceremony: the individual would be tapped on the shoulder with a white baton and formally detained in the name of the king.&lt;ref name=TroutP143&gt;Trout, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; Detention in the Bastille was typically ordered for an indefinite period and there was considerable secrecy over who had been detained and why: the legend of the &quot;[[Man in the Iron Mask]]&quot;, a mysterious prisoner who finally died in 1703, symbolises this period of the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Trout, p.141; Bély, pp.124–5, citing Petitfils (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Although in practice many were held at the Bastille as a form of punishment, legally a prisoner in the Bastille was only being detained for preventative or investigative reasons: the prison was not officially supposed to be a punitive measure in its own right.&lt;ref name=TroutP141&gt;Trout, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; The average length of imprisonment in the Bastille under Louis XIV was approximately three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;LusebrinkP51&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bastille, 1734.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Bastille in 1734, showing the Louis XIV boulevard and the growing &quot;[[faubourg]]&quot; beyond the Porte Saint-Antoine]]

Under Louis, only between 20 and 50 prisoners were usually held at the Bastille at any one time, although as many as 111 were held for a short period in 1703.&lt;ref name=TroutP142/&gt; These prisoners were mainly from the upper classes, and those who could afford to pay for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, wearing their own clothes, living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls.&lt;ref name=TroutP141/&gt; By the late 17th century, there was a rather disorganised library for the use of inmates in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Lefévre, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Andrew Trout suggests that the castle's library was originally a gift from [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]; Martine Lefévre notes early records of the books of dead prisoners being lent out by the staff as a possible origin for the library, or alternatively that the library originated as a gift from Vinache, a rich [[Naples|Neapolitan]].&lt;ref&gt;Trout, p.141, Lefévre, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}

Louis reformed the administrative structure of the Bastille, creating the post of governor, although this post was still often referred to as the captain-governor.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, pp.49, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; During Louis's reign the policing of marginal groups in Paris was greatly increased: the wider criminal justice system was reformed, controls over printing and publishing extended, new criminal codes were issued and the post of the Parisian [[Prefecture of Police|lieutenant general of police]] was created in 1667, all of which would enable the Bastille's later role in support of the Parisian police during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dutray-Lecoin (2010b), p.24; Collins, p.149; McLeod, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1711, a 60-strong French military garrison had been established at the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to be an expensive institution to run, particularly when the prison was full, such as during 1691 when numbers were inflated by the campaign against French Protestants and the annual cost of running the Bastille rose to 232,818 livres.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, pp.50–1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Converting 17th century financial sums into modern equivalents is extremely challenging; for comparison, 232,818 livres was around 1,000 times the annual wages of a typical labourer of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}

Between 1715 – the year of Louis's death – and 1723, power transferred to the ''[[Régence]]''; the regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans]], maintained the prison but the absolutist rigour of Louis XIV's system began to weaken somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, pp.72–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Protestants ceased to be kept in the Bastille, the political uncertainties and plots of the period kept the prison busy and 1,459 were imprisoned there under the Regency, an average of around 182 a year.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011; Schama, p.331.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]], the alleged enemies of the Regency were imprisoned in the Bastille, including [[Marguerite de Launay, baronne de Staal|Marguerite De Launay]].&lt;ref name=FunckP73&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; While in the Bastille, de Launay fell in love with a fellow prisoner, the Chevalier de Ménil; she also infamously received an invitation of marriage from the Chevalier de Maisonrouge, the governor's deputy, who had fallen in love with her himself.&lt;ref name=FunckP73/&gt;

===Reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI (1723–1789)===

====Architecture and organisation====
[[File:Bastille profile, 1750.jpg|thumb|350px|A cross-section of the Bastille viewed from the south in 1750]]

By the late 18th century, the Bastille had come to separate the more aristocratic quarter of [[Le Marais]] in the old city from the working class district of the faubourg Saint-Antoine that lay beyond the Louis XIV boulevard.&lt;ref name=BNF1/&gt; The Marais was a fashionable area, frequented by foreign visitors and tourists, but few went beyond the Bastille into the faubourg.&lt;ref&gt;Garrioch, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; The faubourg was characterised by its built-up, densely populated areas, particularly in the north, and its numerous workshops producing soft furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;Garrioch, p.22; Roche, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Paris as a whole had continued to grow, reaching slightly less than 800,000 inhabitants by the reign of Louis XVI, and many of the residents around the faubourg had migrated to Paris from the countryside relatively recently.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille had its own street address, being officially known as No. 232, rue Saint-Antoine.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structurally, the late-18th century Bastille was not greatly changed from its 14th-century predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; The eight stone towers had gradually acquired individual names: running from the north-east side of the external gate, these were La Chapelle, Trésor, Comté, Bazinière, Bertaudière, Liberté, Puits and Coin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chevallier, p.148&quot;&gt;Chevallier, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; La Chapelle contained the Bastille's chapel, decorated with a painting of [[Saint Peter]] in chains.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, pp.45–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Trésor took its name from the reign of Henry IV, when it had contained the royal treasury.&lt;ref name=CoueretP46&gt;Coueret, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the name of Comté tower are unclear; one theory is that the name refers to the County of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.47; Funck-Brentano, pp.59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Bazinière was named after Bertrand de La Bazinière, a royal treasurer who was imprisoned there in 1663.&lt;ref name=CoueretP46/&gt; Bertaudière was named after a medieval mason who died building the structure in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=CoueretP47&gt;Coueret, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberté tower took its name either from a protest in 1380, when Parisians shouted the phrase outside the castle, or because it was used to house prisoners who had more freedom to walk around the castle than the typical prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.47; Funck-Brentano, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; Puits tower contained the castle well, while Coin formed the corner of the Rue Saint-Antoine.&lt;ref name=CoueretP47/&gt;

The main castle courtyard, accessed through the southern gateway, was 120 feet long by 72 feet wide (37 m by 22 m), and was divided from the smaller northern yard by a three-office wing, built around 1716 and renovated in 1761 in a modern, 18th-century style.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.48; Bournon, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The office wing held the council room that was used for interrogating prisoners, the Bastille's library, and servants' quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper stories included rooms for the senior Bastille staff, and chambers for distinguished prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, pp.48–9.&lt;/ref&gt; An elevated building on one side of the courtyard held the Bastille's archives.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; A clock was installed by [[Antoine de Sartine]], the lieutenant general of police between 1759 and 1774, on the side of the office wing, depicting two chained prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Reichardt, p.226; Coueret, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

New kitchens and baths were built just outside the main gate to the Bastille in 1786.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chevallier, p.148&quot;/&gt; The ditch around the Bastille, now largely dry, supported a {{convert|36|ft|m|adj=on}} high stone wall with a wooden walkway for the use of the guards, known as &quot;la ronde&quot;, or the round.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.57; Funck-Brentano, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; An outer court had grown up around the south-west side of the Bastille, adjacent to the Arsenal. This was open to the public and lined with small shops rented out by the governor for almost 10,000 livres a year, complete with a lodge for the Bastille gatekeeper; it was illuminated at night to light the adjacent street.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.330; Coueret, p.58; Bournon, pp.25–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bastille was run by the governor, sometimes called the captain-governor, who lived in a 17th-century house alongside the fortress.&lt;ref name=DutrayP136&gt;Dutray-Lecoin (2010a), p.136.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor was supported by various officers, in particular his deputy, the ''lieutenant de roi'', or lieutenant of the king, who was responsible for general security and the protection of state secrets; the major, responsible for managing the Bastille's financial affairs and the police archives; and the ''capitaine des portes'', who ran the entrance to the Bastille.&lt;ref name=DutrayP136/&gt; Four warders divided up the eight towers between them.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; From an administrative perspective, the prison was generally well run during the period.&lt;ref name=DutrayP136/&gt; These staff were supported by an official surgeon, a chaplain and could, on occasion, call upon the services of a local midwife to assist pregnant prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, pp.66, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Bastille's surgeon was also responsible for shaving the prisoners, as inmates were not permitted sharp objects such as razors.&lt;ref&gt;Linguet, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} A small garrison of &quot;[[invalides]]&quot; was appointed in 1749 to guard the interior and exterior of the fortress; these were retired soldiers and were regarded locally, as Simon Schama describes, as &quot;amiable layabouts&quot; rather than professional soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.339; Bournon, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of the prison====

The role of the Bastille as a prison changed considerably during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI. One trend was a decline in the number of prisoners sent to the Bastille, with only 1,194 imprisoned there during the reign of Louis XV and only 306 under Louis XVI up until the Revolution, annual averages of around 23 and 20 respectively.&lt;ref name=BNF1/&gt;{{refn|Using slightly different accounting methods, Hans-Jürgen Lüsebrink suggests fractionally lower totals for prisoner numbers between 1660–1789.&lt;ref name=LusebrinkP51&gt;Lüsebrink, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} A second trend was a slow shift away from the Bastille's 17th-century role of detaining primarily upper-class prisoners, towards a situation in which the Bastille was essentially a location for imprisoning socially undesirable individuals of all backgrounds – including aristocrats breaking social conventions, criminals, pornographers, thugs – and was used to support police operations, particularly those involving censorship, across Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Denis, p.38; Dutray-Lecoin (2010b), p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these changes, the Bastille remained a state prison, subject to special authorities, answering to the monarch of the day and surrounded by a considerable and threatening reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Dutray-Lecoin (2010b), p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Louis XV, around 250 Catholic [[Convulsionnaires of Saint-Médard|convulsionnaires]], often called [[Jansenism|Jansenists]], were detained in the Bastille for their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.331; Lacam, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these prisoners were women and came from a wider range of social backgrounds than the upper-class Calvinists detained under Louis XIV; historian Monique Cottret argues that the decline of the Bastille's social &quot;mystique&quot; originates from this phase of detentions.&lt;ref&gt;Cottret, pp.75–6.&lt;/ref&gt; By Louis XVI, the background of those entering the Bastille and the type of offences they were detained over had changed markedly. Between 1774 and 1789, the detentions included 54 people accused of robbery; 31 of involvement in the 1775 Famine Revolt; 11 detained for assault; 62 illegal editors, printers and writers – but relatively few detained over the grander affairs of state.&lt;ref name=LusebrinkP51/&gt;

Many prisoners still continued to come from the upper classes, particularly in those cases termed &quot;désordres des familles&quot;, or disorders of the family. These cases typically involving members of the aristocracy who had, as historian Richard Andrews notes, &quot;rejected parental authority, disgraced the family reputation, manifested mental derangement, squandered capital or violated professional codes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, p.270; Prade, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Their families – often their parents, but sometimes husbands and wives taking action against their spouses – could apply for individuals to be detained at one of the royal prisons, resulting in an average imprisonment of between six months and four years.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, p.270; Farge, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a detention could be preferable to facing a scandal or a public trial over their misdemeanours, and the secrecy that surrounded detention at the Bastille allowed personal and family reputations to be quietly protected.&lt;ref&gt;Trout, pp.141, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille was considered one of the best prisons for an upper-class prisoner to be detained at, because of the standard of the facilities for the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, p.249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the notorious &quot;[[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]&quot; of 1786, involving the Queen and accusations of fraud, all the eleven suspects were held in the Bastille, significantly increasing the notoriety surrounding the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.25–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, however, the Bastille became part of the system of wider policing in Paris. Although appointed by the king, the governor reported to the lieutenant general of police: the first of these, [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]], made only occasional visits to the Bastille, but his successor, [[Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1652–1721)|Marquis d'Argenson]], and subsequent officers used the facility extensively and took a close interest in inspections of the prison.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.72; Dutray-Lecoin (2010a), p.136.&lt;/ref&gt; The lieutenant general reported in turn to the secretary of the &quot;[[Maison du Roi]]&quot;, largely responsible for order in the capital; in practice together they controlled the issuing of the &quot;lettres&quot; in the king's name.&lt;ref&gt;Denis, p.37; ''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille was unusual among Parisian prisons in that it acted on behalf of the king – prisoners could therefore be imprisoned secretly, for longer, and without normal judicial processes being applied, making it a useful facility for the police authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Denis, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille was a preferred location for holding prisoners who needed extensive questioning or where a case required the analysis of extensive documents.&lt;ref&gt;Denis, pp.38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille was also used to store the Parisian police archives; public order equipment such as chains and flags; and illegal goods, seized by order of the crown using a version of the &quot;lettre de cachet&quot;, such as banned books and illicit printing presses.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.81; ''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, but particularly in the middle of the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade in illegal and seditious books in France.&lt;ref name=BirnP51&gt;Birn, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for their role in manufacturing or dealing in banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%.&lt;ref name=BirnP51/&gt;{{refn|Jane McLeod suggests that the breaching of censorship rules by licensed printers was rarely dealt with by regular courts, being seen as an infraction against the Crown, and dealt with by royal officials.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although many of the more famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.331; Funck-Brentano, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for their role in producing illegal pornography, rather than political critiques of the regime.&lt;ref name=LusebrinkP51/&gt; The writer [[Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle]], the philosopher [[André Morellet]] and the historian [[Jean-François Marmontel]], for example, were formally detained not for their more obviously political writings, but for libellous remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, pp.156–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prison regime====
[[File:Bastille Courtyard 1785.jpg|thumb|A sketch of the main courtyard in 1785{{refn|This picture, by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]], shows a number of elegantly dressed women; it is uncertain on what occasion the drawing was made, or what they were doing in Bastille at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Dutray-Lecoin (2010c), p.148.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}]]

Contrary to its later image, conditions for prisoners in the Bastille by the mid-18th century were in fact relatively benign, particularly by the standards of other prisons of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.331–2; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical prisoner was held in one of the octagonal rooms in the mid-levels of the towers.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.331–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The calottes, the rooms just under the roof that formed the upper storey of the Bastille, were considered the least pleasant quarters, being more exposed to the elements and usually either too hot or too cold.&lt;ref name=SchamaP331&gt;Schama, p.331.&lt;/ref&gt; The cachots, the underground dungeons, had not been used for many years except for holding recaptured escapees.&lt;ref name=SchamaP331/&gt; Prisoners' rooms each had a stove or a fireplace, basic furniture, curtains and in most cases a window.  A typical criticism of the rooms was that they were shabby and basic rather than uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.332; Linguet, p.69; Coeuret, p.54-5.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Prisoners described the standard issue furniture as including &quot;a bed of green serge with curtains of the same; a straw mat and a mattress; a table or two, two pitchers, a candleholder and a tin goblet; two or three chairs, a fork, a spoon and everything need to light a fire; by special favour, weak little tongs and two large stones for an [[andiron]].&quot; Linguet complained of only initially having &quot;two mattresses half eaten by the worms, a matted elbow chair... a tottering table, a water pitcher, two pots of Dutch ware and two flagstones to support the fire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Linguet, p.69; Coeuret, p.54-5, citing Charpentier (1789).&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} Like the calottes, the main courtyard, used for exercise, was often criticised by prisoners as being unpleasant at the height of summer or winter, although the garden in the bastion and the castle walls were also used for recreation.&lt;ref&gt;Bournon, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The governor received money from the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with [[Councillor of State (France)|conseiller]]-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, at the other end of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner.&lt;ref name=SchamaP332&gt;Schama, p.332.&lt;/ref&gt; Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.333; Andress, p.xiii; Chevallier, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Linguet noted that &quot;there are tables less lacking; I confess it; mine was among them.&quot; Morellet reported that each day he received &quot;a bottle of decent wine, an excellent one-pound loaf of bread; for dinner, a soup, some beef, an entrée and a desert; in the evening, some roast and a salad.&quot; The abbé Marmontel recorded dinners including &quot;an excellent soup, a succulent slice of beef, a boiled leg of capon, dripping with fat and falling off the bone; a small plate of fried artichokes in a marinade, one of spinach, a very nice &quot;cresonne&quot; pear, fresh grapes, a bottle of old Burgundy wine, and the best Mocha coffee. At the other end of the scale, lesser prisoners might get only &quot;a pound of bread and a bottle of bad wine a day; for dinner...broth and two meat dishes; for supper...a slice of roast, some stew, and some salad&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chevallier, pp.151–2, citing Morellet, p.97, Marmontel, pp.133–5 and Coueret, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.107; Chevallier, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by the standards of the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from [[mental illness]]es and took, by the standards of the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.31; Sérieux and Libert (1914), cited Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bastille Interior 1785.jpg|thumb|left|The council chamber, sketched in 1785]]

Although potentially dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued to bring in additional luxuries, including pet dogs or cats to control the local vermin.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.332, 335.&lt;/ref&gt; The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, and a collection of 133 books.&lt;ref name=SchamaP332/&gt; Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.333.&lt;/ref&gt; Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention of the family of [[James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton|Lord Morton]] and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively normally.&lt;ref&gt;Farge, p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various confiscations by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Lefévre, p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of time that a typical prisoner was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign the average length of detention was only two months.&lt;ref name=LusebrinkP51/&gt; Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising not to talk about the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken.&lt;ref name=DutrayP136/&gt; Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – [[Voltaire]] was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Comparing 18th century sums of money with modern equivalents is notoriously difficult; for comparison, Latude's pension was around one and a third times that of a labourer's annual wage, while Voltaire's was very considerably more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andress, p.xiii&quot;&gt;Andress, p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}

====Criticism and reform====
[[File:Bastille 1719.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dragon]]s destroy the Bastille on the title page of Bucquoy's ''Die Bastille oder die Hölle der Lebenden'']]

During the 18th century, the Bastille was extensively critiqued by French writers as a symbol of ministerial [[despotism]]; this criticism would ultimately result in reforms and plans for its abolition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reichardt, p.226&quot;&gt;Reichardt, p.226.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major criticism emerged from Constantin de Renneville, who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for 11 years and published his accounts of the experience in 1715 in his book ''L'Inquisition françois''.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.10; Renneville (1719).&lt;/ref&gt; Renneville presented a dramatic account of his detention, explaining that despite being innocent he had been abused and left to rot in one of the Bastille's ''cachot'' dungeons, kept enchained next to a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; More criticism followed in 1719 when the Abbé Jean de Bucquoy, who had escaped from the Bastille ten years previously, published an account of his adventures from the safety of [[Hanover]]; he gave a similar account to Renneville's and termed the Bastille the &quot;hell of the living&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.13; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.12; Bucquoy (1719).&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire added to the notorious reputation of the Bastille when he wrote about the case of the &quot;[[Man in the Iron Mask]]&quot; in 1751, and later criticised the way he himself was treated while detained in the Bastille, labelling the fortress a &quot;palace of revenge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.14–5, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|[[Voltaire]] is usually considered to have exaggerated his hardships, as he received a string of visitors each day and in fact voluntarily stayed on within the Bastille after he was officially released in order to complete some business affairs. He also campaigned to have others sent to the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.26–7.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}

In the 1780s, prison reform became a popular topic for French writers and the Bastille was increasingly critiqued as a symbol of arbitrary despotism.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.333; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Two authors were particularly influential during this period. The first was [[Simon-Nicholas Henri Linguet|Simon-Nicholas Linguet]], who was arrested and detained at the Bastille in 1780, after publishing a critique of [[Emmanuel-Félicité de Durfort de Duras|Maréchal Duras]].&lt;ref name=SchamaP334&gt;Schama, p.334.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his release, he published his ''Mémoires sur la Bastille'' in 1783, a damning critique of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.334; Linguet (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Linguet criticised the physical conditions in which he was kept, sometimes inaccurately, but went further in capturing in detail the more psychological effects of the prison regime upon the inmate.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.334–5.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The accuracy of all of Linguet's records on the physical conditions have been questioned by modern historians, for example Simon Schama.&lt;ref name=SchamaP334/&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} Linguet also encouraged Louis XVI to destroy the Bastille, publishing an engraving depicting the king announcing to the prisoners &quot;may you be free and live!&quot;, a phrase borrowed from Voltaire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reichardt, p.226&quot;/&gt;

Linguet's work was followed by another prominent autobiography, [[Jean Henri Latude|Henri Latude]]'s ''Le despotisme dévoilé''.&lt;ref name=SchamaP335&gt;Schama, p.335.&lt;/ref&gt; Latude was a soldier who was imprisoned in the Bastille following a sequence of complex misadventures, including the sending of a letter bomb to [[Madame de Pompadour]], the King's mistress.&lt;ref name=SchamaP335/&gt; Latude became famous for managing to escape from the Bastille by means of climbing up the chimney of his cell and then descending the walls with a home-made rope ladder, before being recaptured afterwards in Amsterdam by French agents.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.336–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Latude was released in 1777, but was rearrested following his publication of a book entitled ''Memoirs of Vengeance.''&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.337–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphlets and magazines publicised Latude's case until he was finally released again in 1784.&lt;ref name=SchamaP338&gt;Schama, p.338.&lt;/ref&gt; Latude became a popular figure with the &quot;[[Académie française]]&quot;, or French Academy, and his autobiography, although inaccurate in places, did much to reinforce the public perception of the Bastille as a despotic institution.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.338; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.31; Latude (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Latude's inaccuracies include his referring to a new fur coat as &quot;half-rotted rags&quot;, for example. Jacques Berchtold observes that Latude's writing also introduced the idea of the hero of the story actively resisting the despotic institution – in this case through escape – in contrast to earlier works which had portrayed the hero merely as the passive victim of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.31; Berchtold, pp.143–5.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}

[[File:Memoires sur la Bastille.jpg|thumb|left|Linguet's ''Mémoires sur la Bastille'', depicting the fictional destruction of the Bastille by Louis XVI]]

Modern historians of this period, such as Hans-Jürgen Lüsebrink, Simon Schama and Monique Cottret, concur that the actual treatment of prisoners in Bastille was much better than the public impression left through these writings.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.334; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, fuelled by the secrecy that still surrounded the Bastille, official as well as public concern about the prison and the system that supported it also began to mount, prompting reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1775, Louis XVI's minister [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]] had authorised all prisoners to be given newspapers to read, and to be allowed to write and to correspond with their family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, pp.78–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1780s [[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|Breteuil]], the [[Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi]], began a substantial reform of the system of ''lettres de cachet'' that sent prisoners to the Bastille: such letters were now required to list the length of time a prisoner would be detained for, and the offence for which they were being held.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, p.247; Funck-Brentano, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1784, the architect Alexandre Brogniard proposed that the Bastille be demolished and converted into a circular, public space with [[colonnade]]s.&lt;ref name=SchamaP338/&gt; Director-General of Finance [[Jacques Necker]], having examined the costs of running the Bastille, amounting to well over 127,000 livres in 1774, for example, proposed closing the institution on the grounds of economy alone.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, pp.81–2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Comparing 18th century sums of money with modern equivalents is notoriously difficult; for comparison, the Bastille's 127,000 livres running costs in 1774 were around 420 times a Parisian labourer's annual wages, or alternatively roughly half the cost of clothing and equipping the Queen in 1785.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andress, p.xiii&quot;/&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} Similarly, Puget, the Bastille's ''lieutenant de roi'', submitted reports in 1788 suggesting that the authorities close the prison, demolish the fortress and sell the real estate off.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1789, the [[Académie royale d'architecture]] proposed a similar scheme to Brogniard's, in which the Bastille would be transformed into an open public area, with a tall column at the centre surrounded by fountains, dedicated to Louis XVI as the &quot;restorer of public freedom&quot;.&lt;ref name=SchamaP338/&gt; The number of prisoners held in the Bastille at any one time declined sharply towards the end of Louis's reign; the prison contained ten prisoners in September 1782 and, despite a mild increase at the beginning of 1788, by July 1789 only seven prisoners remained in custody.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Before any official scheme to close the prison could be enacted, however, disturbances across Paris brought a more violent end to the Bastille.&lt;ref name=SchamaP338/&gt;

====Storming of the Bastille====

Afterwards, Cholat produced a famous amateur [[gouache]] painting showing the events of the day; produced in primitive, naïve style, it combines all the events of the day into a single graphical representation.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.340-2, fig.6.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}]]

By July 1789, [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] sentiment was rising in Paris. The [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] was convened in May and members of the Third Estate proclaimed the [[Tennis Court Oath]] in June, calling for the king to grant a written constitution. Violence between loyal royal forces, mutinous members of the royal [[Gardes Françaises]] and local crowds broke out at [[Vendôme]] on 12 July, leading to widespread fighting and the withdrawal of royal forces from the centre of Paris.&lt;ref name=SchamaP327&gt;Schama, p.327.&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary crowds began to arm themselves during 13 July, looting royal stores, gunsmiths and armourers' shops for weapons and gunpowder.&lt;ref name=SchamaP327/&gt;

The commander of the Bastille at the time was [[Bernard-René de Launay]], a conscientious but minor military officer.&lt;ref name=SchamaP339&gt;Schama, p.339.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions surrounding the Bastille had been rising for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the [[Marquis de Sade]], had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing the public from his walks on top of the towers and, once this was forbidden, shouting from the window of his cell.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.339&lt;/ref&gt; Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted in the governor removing him to an alternative site in early July.&lt;ref name=SchamaP339/&gt;

At de Launay's request, an additional force of 32 soldiers from the Swiss Salis-Samade regiment had been assigned to the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison.&lt;ref name=SchamaP339/&gt; De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone [[abutment]] that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Coueret, p.57.&lt;/ref&gt; The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation.&lt;ref name=SchamaP339/&gt; The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder.&lt;ref name=SchamaP339/&gt; To make matters worse, the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.&lt;ref name=SchamaP339/&gt;{{refn|It is unclear why the Bastille's well was not functioning at this time.|group=upper-alpha}}

On the morning of 14 July around 900 people formed outside the Bastille, primarily working-class members of the nearby faubourg Saint-Antoine, but also including some mutinous soldiers and local traders.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.340.&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd had gathered in an attempt to commandeer the gunpowder stocks known to be held in the Bastille, and at 10:00 am de Launay let in two of their leaders to negotiate with him.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.340; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Just after midday, another negotiator was let in to discuss the situation, but no compromise could be reached: the revolutionary representatives now wanted both the guns and the gunpowder in the Bastille to be handed over, but de Launay refused to do so unless he received authorisation from his leadership in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.340-1.&lt;/ref&gt; By this point it was clear that the governor lacked the experience or the skills to defuse the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as negotiations were about to recommence at around 1:30 pm, chaos broke out as the impatient and angry crowd stormed the outer courtyard of the Bastille, pushing toward the main gate.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.341.&lt;/ref&gt; Confused firing broke out in the confined space and chaotic fighting began in earnest between de Launay's forces and the revolutionary crowd as the two sides exchanged fire.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.341; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; At around 3:30 pm, more mutinous royal forces arrived to reinforce the crowd, bringing with them trained infantry officers and several cannons.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.341-2.&lt;/ref&gt; After discovering that their weapons were too light to damage the main walls of the fortress, the revolutionary crowd began to fire their cannons at the wooden gate of the Bastille.&lt;ref name=SchamaP342&gt;Schama, p.342.&lt;/ref&gt; By now around 83 of the crowd had been killed and another 15 mortally wounded; only one of the Invalides had been killed in return.&lt;ref name=SchamaP343&gt;Schama, p.343.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Launay had limited options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, he would have to turn the cannon directly inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode.&lt;ref name=SchamaP342/&gt; De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.342; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met.&lt;ref name=SchamaP343/&gt; In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.342–3.&lt;/ref&gt; De Launay was dragged outside into the streets and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed during the course of the afternoon by the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.343; Crowdy, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.&lt;ref name=SchamaP343/&gt;

====Destruction====
[[File:Bastille in demolition July 1789.jpg|thumb|300px|The demolition of the walls of the Bastille, July 1789]]

Within hours of its capture, the Bastille began to be used as a powerful symbol to give legitimacy to the revolutionary movement in France.&lt;ref&gt;Reichardt, p.240; Schama, p.345; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; The faubourg Saint-Antoine's revolutionary reputation was firmly established by their storming of the Bastille and a formal list began to be drawn up of the &quot;vainqueurs&quot; who had taken part so as to honor both the fallen and the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Hazan, p.122; Schama, p.347.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the crowd had initially gone to the Bastille searching for gunpowder, historian Simon Schama observes how the captured prison &quot;gave a shape and an image to all the vices against which the Revolution defined itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=ReichardtSchamaP240&gt;Reichardt, p.240; Schama, p.345.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the more despotic and evil the Bastille was portrayed by the pro-revolutionary press, the more necessary and justified the actions of the Revolution became.&lt;ref name=ReichardtSchamaP240/&gt; Consequently, the late governor, de Launay, was rapidly vilified as a brutal despot.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress itself was described by the revolutionary press as a &quot;place of slavery and horror&quot;, containing &quot;machines of death&quot;, &quot;grim underground dungeons&quot; and &quot;disgusting caves&quot; where prisoners were left to rot for up to 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.74, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, in the days after 14 July, the fortress was searched for evidence of torture: old pieces of armour and bits of a printing press were taken out and presented as evidence of elaborate torture equipment.&lt;ref name=SchamaP345&gt;Schama, p.345.&lt;/ref&gt; Latude returned to the Bastille, where he was given the rope ladder and equipment with which he had escaped from the prison many years before.&lt;ref name=SchamaP345/&gt; The former prison warders escorted visitors around the Bastille in the weeks after its capture, giving colourful accounts of the events in the castle.&lt;ref name=SchamaP348/&gt; Stories and pictures about the rescue of the fictional [[Count de Lorges]] – supposedly a mistreated prisoner of the Bastille incarcerated by Louis XV – and the similarly imaginary discovery of the skeleton of the &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot; in the dungeons, were widely circulated as fact across Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Reichardt, pp.241–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the coming months, over 150 [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] publications used the storming of the Bastille as a theme, while the events formed the basis for a number of theatrical plays.&lt;ref&gt;Reichardt, p.226; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.98–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a thorough search, the revolutionaries discovered only seven prisoners in the Bastille, rather fewer than had been anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.344–5; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, only one – de Whyte de Malleville, an elderly and white-bearded man – closely resembled the public image of a Bastille prisoner; despite being mentally ill, he was paraded through the streets, where he waved happily to the crowds.&lt;ref name=SchamaP345/&gt; Of the remaining six liberated prisoners, four were convicted forgers who quickly vanished into the Paris streets; one was the [[Count de Solages]], who had been imprisoned on the request of his family for sexual misdemeanours; the sixth was Tavernier&lt;!--who?  this is the first time he is mentioned--&gt;, who also proved to be mentally ill and, along with Whyte, was in due course reincarcerated in the [[Charenton (asylum)|Charenton asylum]].&lt;ref name=SchamaLusebrinkP345&gt;Schama, p.345; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Jacques-François-Xavier de Whyte, often called Major Whyte, had originally been imprisoned for sexual misdemeanours – by 1789 he believed himself to be [[Julius Caesar]], accounting for his positive reaction to being paraded through the streets.

At first the revolutionary movement was uncertain whether to destroy the prison, to reoccupy it as a fortress with members of the volunteer guard militia, or to preserve it intact as a permanent revolutionary monument.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p.347.&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutionary leader [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] eventually settled the matter by symbolically starting the destruction of the battlements himself, after which a panel of five experts was appointed by the Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville to manage the demolition of the castle.&lt;ref name=SchamaP348&gt;Schama, p.348.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|[[Pierre-François Palloy|Palloy]] actually began some limited demolition work on the evening of the 14 July, before any formal authorisation had been given.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.120.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} One of these experts was [[Pierre-François Palloy]], a bourgeois entrepreneur who claimed vainqueur status for his role during the taking of the Bastille, and he rapidly assumed control over the entire process.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.347–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Palloy's team worked quickly and by November most of the fortress had been destroyed.&lt;ref name=SchamaP349&gt;Schama, p.349.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of the Bastille rapidly became iconic across France.&lt;ref name=SchamaP345/&gt; Palloy had an altar set up on the site in February 1790, formed out of iron chains and restraints from the prison.&lt;ref name=SchamaP349/&gt; Old bones, probably of 15th century soldiers, were discovered during the clearance work in April and, presented as the skeletons of former prisoners, were exhumed and ceremonially reburied in Saint-Paul's cemetery.&lt;ref name=SchamaP350&gt;Schama, p.350.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, a huge ball was held by Palloy on the site for the [[National Guard (France)|National Guardsmen]] visiting Paris for the 14 July celebrations.&lt;ref name=SchamaP350/&gt; A memorabilia industry surrounding the fall of the Bastille was already flourishing and as the work on the demolition project finally dried up, Palloy started producing and selling memorabilia of the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.351–2; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.80–1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The extent to which [[Pierre-François Palloy|Palloy]] was motivated by money, revolutionary zeal or both is unclear; Simon Schama is inclined to portray him as a businessman first, Hans-Jürgen Lüsebrink and Rolf Reichardt depict him as a slightly obsessed revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.351–3; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.120–1.&lt;/ref&gt; |group=upper-alpha}} Palloy's products, which he called &quot;relics of freedom&quot;, celebrated the national unity that the events of July 1789 had generated across all classes of French citizenry, and included a very wide range of items.&lt;ref name=SchamaP351&gt;Schama, p.351.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|[[Pierre-François Palloy|Palloy]]'s products included a working model of the fortress; royal and revolutionary portraits; miscellaneous objects such as inkwells and paperweights, made from recycled parts of the Bastille; Latude's biography and other carefully selected items.&lt;ref name=SchamaP351/&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} Palloy also sent models of the Bastille, carved from the fortress's stones, as gifts to the French provinces at his own expense to spread the revolutionary message.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.120–1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 a large [http://www.wikigallery.org/wiki/painting_258643/(after)-Monnet,-Charles/The-Fountain-of-Regeneration-over-the-Ruins-of-the-Bastille revolutionary fountain] featuring a statue of [[Isis]] was built on the former site of the fortress, which became known as the [[Place de la Bastille]].&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th–20th century political and cultural legacy===
[[File:Bastille foundations.jpg|thumb|The foundations of the Liberté Tower of the Bastille, rediscovered during excavations for the [[Bastille (Paris Métro)|Métro]] in 1899&lt;ref&gt;Amalvi, p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Bastille remained a powerful and evocative symbol for French republicans throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Amalvi, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] overthrew the [[French First Republic]] that emerged from the Revolution in 1799, and subsequently attempted to marginalise the Bastille as a symbol.&lt;ref name=LusebrinkReichardtP220&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon was unhappy with the revolutionary connotations of the Place de la Bastille, and initially considered building his [[Arc de Triomphe]] on the site instead.&lt;ref name=SchamaP3&gt;Schama, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved an unpopular option and so instead he planned the construction of a huge, bronze statue of an imperial elephant.&lt;ref name=SchamaP3/&gt; The project was delayed, eventually indefinitely, and all that was constructed was a [[Elephant of the Bastille|large plaster version]] of the bronze statue, which stood on the former site of the Bastille between 1814 and 1846, when the decaying structure was finally removed.&lt;ref name=SchamaP3/&gt; After the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration of the French Bourbon monarchy]] in 1815, the Bastille became an underground symbol for Republicans.&lt;ref name=LusebrinkReichardtP220/&gt; The [[July Revolution]] in 1830, used images such as the Bastille to legitimise their new regime and in 1833, the former site of the Bastille was used to build the [[July Column]] to commemorate the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p.40; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt; The short-lived [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was symbolically declared in 1848 on the former revolutionary site.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, had been celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, and then later during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.155–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity in the face of foreign threats.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.156–7.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]; when the moderate Republican [[Jules Grévy]] became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.229.&lt;/ref&gt; The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition of the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, p.259; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; The July Column itself remained contentious and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried to blow it up in 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burton, p.40&quot;&gt;Burton, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the legacy of the Bastille proved popular among French novelists. [[Alexandre Dumas]], for example, used the Bastille and the legend of the &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot; extensively in his [[d'Artagnan Romances]]; in these novels the Bastille is presented as both picturesque and tragic, a suitable setting for heroic action.&lt;ref&gt;Sacquin, pp.186–7.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in many of Dumas's other works, such as ''Ange Pitou'', the Bastille takes on a much darker appearance, being described as a place in which a prisoner is &quot;forgotten, bankrupted, buried, destroyed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sacquin, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[Charles Dickens]] took a similar perspective when he drew on popular histories of the Bastille in writing ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', in which Doctor Manette is &quot;buried alive&quot; in the prison for 18 years; many historical figures associated with the Bastille are reinvented as fictional individuals in the novel, such as Claude Cholat, reproduced by Dickens as &quot;Ernest Defarge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Glancy, pp.18, 33; Sacquin, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 novel ''[[Les Miserables]]'', set just after the Revolution, gave Napoleon's plaster Bastille elephant a permanent place in literary history. In 1889 the continued popularity of the Bastille with the public was illustrated by the decision to build a replica in stone and wood for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] [[World's fair|world fair]] in Paris, manned by actors in period costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Giret, p.191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to the diffusion of national and Republican ideas across France during the second half of the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.235.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the [[French Resistance]] during the [[Second World War]] and until the 1950s [[Bastille Day]] remained the single most significant French national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Nora, p.118; Ayers, p.188; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, pp.232–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remains==
[[File:Bd Henri IV- Vestige de la Bastille.JPG|thumb|Remaining stones of the Bastille are still visible now on Boulevard Henri IV]]
Due to its destruction after 1789, very little remains of the Bastille in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=DutrayP136/&gt; During the excavations for the [[Bastille (Paris Métro)|Métro]] underground train system in 1899, the foundations of the Liberté Tower were uncovered and moved to the corner of the Boulevard Henri IV and the Quai de Celestins, where they can still be seen today.&lt;ref&gt;Hazan, p.11; Amalvi, p.184.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pont de la Concorde (Paris)|Pont de la Concorde]] contains stones reused from the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, p.391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some relics of the Bastille survive: the [[Carnavalet Museum]] holds objects including one of the stone models of the Bastille made by [[Pierre-François Palloy|Palloy]] and the rope ladder used by [[Jean Henri Latude|Latude]] to escape from the prison roof in the 18th century, while the mechanism and bells of the prison clock are exhibited in [[Musée Européen d'Art Campanaire]] at [[L'Isle-Jourdain, Gers|L'Isle-Jourdain]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.carnavalet.paris.fr/fr/collections/modele-reduit-de-la-bastille Modèle réduit de la Bastille]'', [[Carnavalet Museum]], accessed 2 September 2011; Berchtold, p.145; Dutray-Lecoin (2010a), p.136.&lt;/ref&gt; The key to the Bastille was given to [[George Washington]] in 1790 by [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and is displayed in the historic house of [[Mount Vernon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/bastille-key/ Bastille Key]'', [[Mount Vernon|George Washington's Mount Vernon and Historic Gardens]], accessed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille's archives are now held by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bnf.fr/fr/collections_et_services/anx_fds_col/a.archives_bastille.html Archives de la Bastille] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909092509/http://www.bnf.fr/fr/collections_et_services/anx_fds_col/a.archives_bastille.html |date=September 9, 2011 }}'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Place de la Bastille]] still occupies most of the location of the Bastille, and the [[Opéra Bastille]] was built on the square in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the storming of the prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burton, p.40&quot;/&gt; The surrounding area has largely been redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past. The ditch that originally linked the defences of the fortress to the [[River Seine]] had been dug out at the start of the 19th century to form the industrial harbour of the [[Bassin de l'Arsenal]], linked to the [[Canal Saint Martin]], but is now a marina for pleasure boats, while the [[Promenade plantée|Promenade Plantée]] links the square with redeveloped parklands to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Berens, p.237-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
[[File:Losme journal page.jpg|thumb|Journal of Antoine-Jérôme de Losme, the Bastille major, describing the days before the fall of the Bastille in 1789]]

A number of histories of the Bastille were published immediately after July 1789, usually with dramatic titles promising the uncovering of secrets from the prison.&lt;ref name=MuzerelleP170&gt;Muzerelle (2010b), p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1830s and 1840s, popular histories written by Pierre Joigneaux and by the trio of [[Auguste Maquet]], [[Auguste Arnould]] and [[Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol]] presented the years of the Bastille between 1358 and 1789 as a single, long period of royal tyranny and oppression, epitomised by the fortress; their works featured imaginative 19th-century reconstructions of the medieval torture of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Amalvi, p.181; Joigneaux (1838); Maquet, Arnould and Alboize Du Pujol (1844).&lt;/ref&gt; As living memories of the Revolution faded, the destruction of the Bastille meant that later historians had to rely primarily on memoires and documentary materials in analysing the fortress and the 5,279 prisoners who had come through the Bastille between 1659 and 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Dutray-Lecoin (2010a), p.136; ''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastille's archives, recording the operation of the prison, had been scattered in the confusion after the seizure; with some effort, the Paris Assembly gathered around 600,000 of them in the following weeks, which form the basis of the modern archive.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://classes.bnf.fr/classes/pages/pdf/Bastille1.pdf La Bastille ou « l’Enfer des vivants »?]'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 8 August 2011.; Funck-Brentano, pp.52–4.&lt;/ref&gt; After being safely stored and ignored for many years, these archives were rediscovered by the French historian François Ravaisson, who catalogued and used them for research between 1866 and 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, pp.55–6; Muzerelle (2010b), p.170.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century the historian [[Frantz Funck-Brentano]] used the archives to undertake detailed research into the operation of the Bastille, focusing on the upper class prisoners in the Bastille, disproving many of the 18th-century myths about the institution and portraying the prison in a favourable light.&lt;ref&gt;Muzerelle (2010b), p.170; Funck-Bretano (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians today consider Funck-Brentano's work slightly biased by his anti-Republican views, but his histories of the Bastille were highly influential and were largely responsible for establishing that the Bastille was a well-run, relatively benign institution.&lt;ref&gt;Muzerelle (2010b), p.170; Amalvi, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Fernand Bournon used the same archive material to produce the ''Histoire de la Bastille'' in 1893, considered by modern historians to be one of the best and most balanced 19th-century histories of the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Muzerelle (2010b), p.170; Bournon (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; These works inspired the writing of a sequence of more popular histories of the Bastille in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Auguste Coeuret's anniversary history of the Bastille, which typically focused on a handful of themes and stories involving the more glamorous prisoners from the upper classes of French society.&lt;ref&gt;Muzerelle (2010b), p.170; Lüsebrink and Reichardt, p.207; Coeuret (1890).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major debates on the actual taking of the Bastille in 1789 has been the nature of the crowds that stormed the building. [[Hippolyte Taine]] argued in the late 19th century that the crowd consisted of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, the post-war left-wing intellectual [[George Rudé]] argued that the crowd was dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p.313; Rudé (1959); Taine (1878).&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was reexamined by [[Jacques Godechot]] in the post-war years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans and traders, at least half the crowd that gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Godechot (1965); Schama, p.762; Kennedy, p.313.&lt;/ref&gt; Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p.313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s French [[sociology|sociologist]]s, particularly those interested in [[critical theory]], re-examined this historical legacy.&lt;ref name=MuzerelleP170/&gt; The [[Annales School]] conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on the operation of the police, concepts of [[deviancy]] and religion.&lt;ref name=MuzerelleP170/&gt; Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes.&lt;ref name=MuzerelleP170/&gt; Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse Lüsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, pp.245–6; Lüsebrink and Reichardt (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; This body of work influenced historian [[Simon Schama]]'s 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, pp.12–3; Schama (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] held a major exhibition on the legacy of the Bastille between 2010 and 2011, resulting in a substantial edited volume summarising the current academic perspectives on the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bnf.fr/en/cultural_events/anx_exhibitions/f.bastille_eng.html The &quot;Bastille&quot; or &quot;Living in Hell&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112055927/http://www.bnf.fr/en/cultural_events/anx_exhibitions/f.bastille_eng.html |date=November 12, 2011 }}'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], accessed 29 August 2011; Dutray-Lecoin and Muzerelle (eds) (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lanterne''''' is a French word designating a [[lantern]] or [[lamp post]]. The word, or the slogan &quot;'''À la lanterne!'''&quot; (in [[English language|English]]: To the Lamp Post!) gained special meaning and status in [[Paris]] and [[France]] during the early phase of the [[French Revolution]], from the summer of 1789.&lt;ref name=erwin&gt;{{cite book|last=Erwin|first=James L.|author2=Fremont-Barnes, Gregory|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2007|pages=388–389|isbn=9780313049514|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamp posts served as an instrument to mobs to perform extemporised [[lynching]]s and [[execution]]s in the streets of Paris during the revolution when the people of Paris occasionally hanged officials and aristocrats from the lamp posts. The English equivalent would be &quot;String Them Up!&quot; ([[British English|British]]) or &quot;Hang 'Em High!&quot;([[American English|American]])

As the revolutionary government became established, lamp posts were no longer needed as execution instruments, being replaced by the [[guillotine]] which became infamous in Paris during 1792-1794, though all major French cities had their own.

[[File:Jaurès-Histoire socialiste-I-p39.PNG|thumb|left|150px|[[Joseph Foullon de Doué]], the first victim of lynching &quot;à la lanterne&quot;]]
The first prominent victim of lynching &quot;à la lanterne&quot; was [[Joseph Foullon de Doué]], an unpopular politician who replaced [[Jacques Necker]] as a [[Controller-General of Finances]] in 1789.&lt;ref name=erwin/&gt; On 22 July 1789, the mob attempted to hang him on a lamp post, however, after the rope broke, he was beheaded and radicals marched with his head on a pike through the streets.&lt;ref name=erwin/&gt; &quot;If [the people] are hungry, let them eat grass,&quot; he is said to have once proclaimed, although the claim is unsubstantiated. Because Foulon, an aristocrat administrator of the royal government, was in charge of the Paris markets. Foulon was known for his coldheartedness towards the needs of the common French people; he was suspected of controlling Paris' food supply and, thereby, keeping food prices unaffordable.  So hated that he had even staged his own funeral to escape the people's wrath, the 74-year-old Foulon had spent years growing rich at his post while the poor starved.  On 22 July 1789, he was captured by an angry Paris crowd, who stuffed Foulon's mouth with grass, then summarily hanged him from the boom of a lamp post at The Place de Grève, in front of the town hall (L'Hôtel de Ville). But the rope broke, and Foulon was hanged again and again before he was dropped to the ground and decapitated.  His head, its mouth still full of grass, was placed on a pike—a long, sharpened, wooden pole—and paraded through the streets. Later that day, Foulon's son-in-law, [[Louis Bénigne François Bertier de Sauvigny]], was taken to the Place de Grève and hanged there, from the lamp post. De Sauvigny's severed head was placed on a pike of its own.  Those bearing the pikes put the two severed heads together and chanted, &quot;Kiss Daddy!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. M., ''The French Revolution''. Oxford, Basil Blackwell.1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/imaging/essays/roberts1.html|title=Images of Popular Violence in the French Revolution: Evidence for the Historian?|last=Roberts|first=Warren|publisher=A project of the Center for History &amp; New Media, [[George Mason University]] and the Department of History, [[University of California, Los Angeles]] for the [[American Historical Review]]|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 two of the ''invalids'' (veteran soldiers) forming part of the garrison of the fortress were hanged in the place de Greve, although it is not recorded whether ''lanternes'' were used for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 404 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 1790, the crowd massacred and hanged barrister Pascalis and [[Knighthood|chevalier]] de La Rochette from a lamp post in [[Aix-en-Provence]].

On 20 June 1792, a mob broke into the [[Tuileries]] and threatened the queen [[Marie Antoinette]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5081">The '''Grand Châtelet''' was a stronghold in [[Ancien Régime]] [[Paris]], on the right bank of the [[Seine]], on the site of what is now the [[Place du Châtelet]]; it contained a court and police headquarters and a number of prisons.

[[File:Grand châtelet de Paris.JPG|thumb|250px|The Grand Châtelet around 1800, looking south from the rue Saint-Denis]]

The original building on the site may have been a wooden tower constructed by [[Charles the Bald]] in 870 to defend the then new Grand-Pont bridge (now replaced by the [[Pont au Change]]), but it is known that [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] built a stronger structure in stone, a ''châtelet'' ('small castle'), in 1130; it was called the Grand Châtelet in contrast to the [[Petit Châtelet]] built around the same time at the end of the [[Petit Pont]], on the south bank of the Seine.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Hillairet, ''Dictionnaire historique des rues de Paris'', 8th ed. (Éditions de Minuit, 1985), Vol. 1, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; It lost its defensive purpose in 1190 when [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] built a rampart around the perimeter of the city; from then on it served as the headquarters of the ''prévôt de Paris'', the official &quot;charged with protection of royal rights, oversight of royal administration, and execution of royal justice&quot; in late medieval Paris.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Kibler and Grover A. Zinn, ''Medieval France: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 1995: ISBN 0-8240-4444-4), p. 758.&lt;/ref&gt; The court of the Châtelet was always subordinate to the [[Parlement de Paris]], but it had extensive criminal and civil jurisdiction, and treason cases were frequently tried there. For centuries, the magistrates of the Châtelet clashed with those of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] over jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Léon Bernard, ''The Emerging City: Paris in the Age of Louis XIV'' (Duke University Press, 1970), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Châtelet was rebuilt by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], but by 1460 it had fallen into such disrepair that the sittings of the court were held at the [[Louvre]], not returning until 1506; in 1657 the court was once again forced to move temporarily, this time to the convent of the Grands [[Augustinians|Augustins]] on the [[Rue Dauphine]].&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Paris, from the Earliest Period to the Present Day'' (A. and W. Galignani, 1825), pp. 100-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1684 the structure was almost completely rebuilt by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], taking on the form that it had until it was demolished after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. &quot;The roadway which passed under the Chatelet (in effect the continuation of the Rue Saint-Denis) set apart the municipal prison on the eastern side of the structure from the various magisterial chambers to the west.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, ''The Emerging City'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the western side lay the city [[morgue]]; the prisons on the eastern side increased in number from nine to twenty over the years, ranging from dormitories where prisoners lived &quot;à la pistole,&quot; that is with beds, to those called &quot;au secret,&quot; ranging from a huge hall with straw mats to subterranean dungeons.&lt;ref&gt;Hillairet, ''Dictionnaire historique des rues de Paris'', p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Like all edifices in the Old Regime connected with the administration of justice, the Chatelet enjoyed a very sinister reputation, even worse than the storied [[Bastille]]. Relatively few Parisians of common stock were ever able to claim the dubious distinction that a relative or friend languished in the dungeons of the Bastille; many more could make the claim for the dank chambers of the Châtelet, inherently far more fearsome than the dry and relatively comfortable prison a mile to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, ''The Emerging City'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Among the famous prisoners who spent time in the Châtelet were [[Clément Marot]], who composed his ''Enfer'' there; the famous highwayman [[Louis Dominique Bourguignon|Cartouche]]; the poisoner [[Antoine François Desrues|Antoine-François Desrues]] (1744-1777); and the [[Thomas de Mahy, marquis de Favras|marquis de Favras]].

The area around the Châtelet was physically unpleasant as well, due to the smell of drying blood from nearby slaughterhouses and &quot;the effluent of the great sewers that oozed into the Seine between the Pont Notre-Dame and the Pont-au-Change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Garrioch, ''The Making of Revolutionary Paris'' (University of California Press, 2002: ISBN 0-520-23253-4), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, with the abolition of the office of ''prévôt de Paris'', the Châtelet lost its function, and as part of the general refurbishment of the area it was demolished between 1802 and 1810 and the [[Place du Châtelet]] created at the north end of the bridge.

The '''Souvenir napoléonien''', founded in 1937, is an association which promotes the historical study of the [[Napoleonic era]]. Its full name is the '''Société française d'histoire napoléonienne'''.

== Background ==
First established in the year 1937 by Eugénie Gal, a great-great-niece of [[Louis Gabriel Suchet|Marshal Suchet]], the ''Souvenir napoléonien'' was recognized as a benevolent association by a French decree dated 5 November 1982.
The society studies and makes known the history of the [[First French Empire|First]] and [[Second French Empire]]s, from the time of the [[French Revolution]], the [[House of Bonaparte|imperial family]], and the institutions, places, and people who were part of this history. For this purpose, it organizes a wide variety of events, such as conferences, seminars, study visits, and commemorations, at the international, national and regional levels, both in France and abroad.

The society works closely with the ''Fondation Napoléon'', from which it receives financial support for the publication of its magazine, the ''Revue du souvenir napoléonien''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleonica.org/na/na_fondation.html La Fondation Napoléon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The officers of the ''Souvenir napoléonien'' are a President, an Honorary President, three Vice-Presidents, a Treasurer and a Deputy Treasurer. The governing body is called the Steering Committee. There is also a General Secretary and an editor-in-chief of the magazine.

In [[France]] and abroad, delegates are tasked with the organization of venues and conferences. The delegations in France are as follows: [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], [[Picardy (region)|Picardy]], [[Normandy]], [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], [[Paris]] and [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]], [[Champagne-Ardenne]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], [[Alsace]], [[Loire Valley]], Berry, [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]], [[Franche-Comté]], [[Poitou-Charentes]], [[Limousin (region)|Limousin-Quercy]], [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], [[Lyonnais]], [[Dauphiné]]-Savoie, [[Aquitaine]], [[Midi-Pyrénées]], [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], [[Nice]] [[Alpes-Maritimes]], and [[Corsica]].

The delegations abroad are: Northern Italy, [[Rome]] and Central Italy, [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]]. In addition, there are overseas correspondents for [[Montreal]], [[Bogota]], [[Vienna]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

== Library ==
The Souvenir napoléonien has a library which was initially established with about five hundred books from the library of Baron Jean Thiry, bequeathed to the society by the historian's children. This library is constantly expanded by donations from the society's members and from authors and publishers, as well as by purchases, and is available for the use of members of the association and of students in a building at 82 rue de Monceau, [[Paris]].

The library contains the archive of the ''Revue du Souvenir napoléonien'' magazine, starting from issue number 233 of December 1967.

== The ''Revue du Souvenir napoléonien'' ==
Many historians, including [[Thierry Lentz]], [[Michel Wilmot]], [[Maurice Bernard-Catinat]], [[Jacques-Olivier Boudon]], and [[Jean Étèvenaux]], have contributed to the society's magazine ''Revue du Souvenir napoléonien'' on topics relating to the Napoleonic era, from the [[French Directory|Directoire]] to the [[Second French Empire]].

[[File:Lar7 cogniet 001z.jpg|thumb|300px|The White flag of the [[Ancien Régime|monarchy]] transformed into the Tricolore as a result of the [[July Revolution]], painting by [[Léon Cogniet]] (1830).]]

A '''tricolour'''  is a type of [[flag]] or [[banner]] design with a [[Triband (flag)|triband]] design which originated in the 16th century as a symbol of [[classical republicanism|republicanism]], [[liberty]] or indeed [[revolution]].  The [[Flag of France|flags of France]], [[Flag of Italy|Italy]], [[Flag of Romania|Romania]], [[Flag of Mexico|Mexico]], and [[Flag of Ireland|Ireland]] were all first adopted with the formation of an independent [[republic]] in the period of the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Revolutions of 1848]], with the exception of the Irish tricolour, which dates from 1848 but was not popularised until the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 and adopted in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/tricolor|title=tricolor - definition of tricolor in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first association of the tricolour with republicanism is the orange-white-blue design of the [[Prince's Flag]] (''Prinsenvlag'', predecessor of the flags [[flag of the Netherlands|of the Netherlands]] and [[flag of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]), used from 1579 by [[William I of Orange-Nassau]] in the [[Eighty Years' War]], establishing the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]] from the [[Spanish Empire]].
 
One of the most famous tricolour, known as ''Le Tricolore'', is the blue-white-red (whence also called ''Le Bleu-Blanc-Rouge'') [[flag of France]] adopted in the [[French Revolution]].
With the formation of [[French client republic]]s after 1795, the revolutionary tricolour was adopted more widely, by 
the [[Republic of Alba]] 1796 (red-blue-yellow),
the [[Cisalpine Republic]] 1797    ([[Transpadane Republic]], green-white-red),
the [[Cisrhenian Republic]] 1797 (green-white-red),
the [[Anconine Republic]] 1797  (blue-yellow-red),
the [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] 1798 (black-white-red),
the [[Helvetic Republic]] 1798 (green-yellow-red; [[canton of Neuchatel]] 1848), 
the [[Parthenopean Republic]] 1799 (blue-yellow-red), 
the [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino]] 1805 (blue-white-red).

The green-white-red tricolour remained a symbol of republicanism throughout the 19th century and was adopted as [[national flag]] by a number of states following the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. It was also adopted by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (inherited by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] 1861).

The [[flag of Germany]] (black-red-gold) originated as the flag of the revolutionary, anti-monarchist [[Freikorps]] of the 1830s and was later adopted by the republicanist bourgeoisie, at the time known as ''Dreifarb'', a German calque of ''Tricolore''. This flag was a symbol of opposition against the German ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'' and the desire for [[German Unification]]. It was at first illegal in the [[German Confederation]], but was adopted as the national flag at the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848/9. The [[flag of Belgium]] was introduced in a similar context, in 1831, its colours taken from the flag used in the [[Brabant Revolution]] of 1789.
The first national flag of the [[New World]] inspired by this symbolism was the [[flag of Mexico]], adopted when the [[First Mexican Empire]] gained [[Mexican War of Independence|independence from Spain]] in 1821.

After 1848, the young republican [[nation state]]s continued to pick triband designs, but now more prevalently expressing the sentiment of [[nationalism]] or [[ethnic identity]] than anti-monarchism, the [[flag of Hungary]] (1848),&lt;!--hard to argue the Hungarian revolution was anti-monarchist as they chose the colours of the old Hungarian royal coat of arms. It was nationalist because they wanted to get rid of the *foreign* (Austrian) monarchs, but their own monarchy was sufficiently removed not to clash with the republican sentiment. Sources needed.--&gt;
the [[flag of Romania]] (1848), &lt;!--apparently also royal colours, of [[Michael the Brave]]--&gt;
the [[Flag of Ireland]] (1848),
the [[flag of Estonia]] (1880s),
the [[flag of Lithuania]] (1905),
and the [[flag of Armenia]] (1918). &lt;!--although this was based on a royal design, of the [[Rubenid Dynasty]]--&gt;
By contrast, the [[flag of Russia]] was adopted by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the late 17th century and while it may or may not have been inspired by the Dutch tricolour, it never had any republican implications.

The political ideology of the unification of an ethnic [[nation state]] associated with the flag since the 19th century has resulted in the design of new &quot;tricolours&quot; expressing specific [[nationalism]]s in the 20th century, 
the [[Pan-African colors]] adopted in the 1920s for [[Pan-Africanism]], chosen in numerous African flags during [[decolonisation]] (green-yellow-red, taken from the triband design used by the [[Solomonic dynasty]] for the [[Ethiopian Empire]] since 1897). The [[Pan-Arab colors]] adopted in [[Arab nationalism]] 1916 are a comparable concept, even though they combine four, not three, colours.
Also in the 20th century, [[Pan-Iranian colors]] for [[Iranian nationalism]] and [[Pan-Slavic colors]] for [[Pan-Slavism|Slavic nationalism]] were adopted based on the triband design of the flags used during the 19th century by the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the [[Russian Empire]], respectively.

The [[Indian independence movement]] in 1931 also adopted a tricolour (loan-translated as Hindi, तिरंगा ''Tiraṅgā'') in the traditional symbolism of &quot;national unification&quot; and republican &quot;self-rule&quot; ([[Purna Swaraj]]), adopted as the [[Flag of India|flag of the Indian Republic]] in 1947.

In 1999, a red, green, and blue tricolour was proposed as the [[Flag of Mars]]. The design symbolizes [[liberty]], and also the [[terraforming of Mars]] by [[human]]ity from a red planet to a green one, and eventually an Earth-like blue one.

{{History of France}}

The '''National Convention''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Convention nationale}}) was the third French government of the French Revolution, following the two-year [[National Constituent Assembly]] and the one-year [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]].  Created after the great insurrection of [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], it was the first French government organized as a republic, abandoning the monarchy altogether.  The Convention sat as a single-chamber assembly from 20 September 1792 to 26 October 1795 (4 Brumaire IV under the [[French Republican Calendar|Convention's adopted calendar]]).

The Convention came about when the Legislative Assembly, which had found it impossible to work with the king, decreed the provisional suspension of [[King Louis XVI]] and the convocation of a National Convention to draw up a new constitution with no monarchy at all.  The other major innovation was to decree that deputies to that convention should be elected by all Frenchmen twenty-five years old or more, domiciled for a year and living by the product of their labor. The National Convention was therefore the first French assembly elected by universal male suffrage, without distinctions of class.

Although the Convention lasted until 1795, power was effectively stripped from the elected deputies and concentrated in the small [[Committee of Public Safety]] from April 1793.  The eight months from Fall 1793 to Spring 1794, when [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and his allies dominated the Committee of Public Safety, represents the most radical and bloodiest phase of the French Revolution.  After the fall of Robespierre, the Convention lasted for another year until a new constitution was written, ushering in the [[French Directory]].

== Elections==

The [[French National Convention election, 1792|election]] took place from 2 to 6 September 1792 after the election of the electoral colleges by primary assemblies on 26 August. Owing to the abstention of aristocrats, the anti-republicans, and the fear of victimization the voter turnout in the departments was low – 11.9% of the electorate came, compared to 10.2% in the 1791 elections - in spite of the fact that the number of those eligible to vote had doubled. Therefore, universal male suffrage had very little impact. The electorate returned the same sort of men that the [[Active and passive citizens|active citizens]] had chosen in 1791.{{sfn|Dupuy|2005|p=34-40}}

In the whole of France, only eleven primary assemblies wanted to retain the monarchy. Of the electoral assemblies, all tacitly voted for a republic – though only Paris used the word. None of the deputies stood as a royalist for elections. Out of the five million Frenchmen able to vote, only a million showed up at the polls. {{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=310}}{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|The Convention had therefore been elected by small minority of the population, but those who were the most determined. That explains the ambiguity of the word &quot;popular&quot; when it is applied to this period: &quot;popular&quot; the French Revolution was certainly ''not''  in the sense of participation by the people in public affairs. But if the word &quot;popular&quot; is taken to mean that revolutionary policy was formed under pressure from the ''[[sans-culotte]]'' movement and organized minorities, and received an egalitarian impetus from them, then yes, the Revolution had well and truly entered its &quot;popular&quot; age.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=115}}}}

The Convention held its first sessions in a hall of the [[Tuileries Palace]], then it sat in the [[Salle du Manège]], and finally from 10 May 1793 in that of the [[Théâtre des Tuileries|Salle des Machines]], an immense hall in which the deputies were loosely scattered. This last hall had the galleries for the public who often influenced the debate by interruptions or applause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/natcon.html The National Convention] 1906&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|During the early meetings of the Convention the deputies had sat indiscriminately, where they pleased. But it was noticed that, as the quarrel between Jacobins and Girondins developed, they grouped themselves to the right and left of the President's chair, whiles the extreme Jacobins found a place of vantage in the higher seats at the end of the hall, which came to be called the Mountain (''La Montagne'').{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=320}}}}

The members of the Convention came from all classes of society, but the most numerous were lawyers. 75 members had sat in the [[National Constituent Assembly]], 183 in the [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. The full number of deputies was 749, not counting 33 from the French colonies, of whom only some arrived in Paris in time. Besides these, however, the newly formed {{lang|fr|''[[département in France|départements]]''}} annexed to France from 1792 to 1795 were allowed to send deputations.

According to its own ruling, the Convention elected its President every fortnight. He was eligible for re-election after the lapse of a fortnight. Ordinarily the sessions were held in the morning, but evening sessions also occurred frequently, often extending late into the night. Sometimes in exceptional circumstances the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat for several days without interruption. For both legislative and administrative the Convention used committees, with powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive laws. The most famous of these committees included the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and the [[Committee of General Security]].

The Convention held [[legislative power|legislative]] and [[executive power|executive]] powers during the first years of the [[French First Republic]] and had three distinct periods: Girondin, Montagnard or Jacobin, and Thermidorian.

== Girondin Convention ==
{{quote|The abolition of the royalty is a matter you cannot put off till tomorrow.|[[Collot d'Herbois]]{{sfn|Aulard|1910|p=147}}}}

The first session was held on 20 September 1792. The following day, amidst profound silence, the proposition was put to the assembly, &quot;[[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|That royalty be abolished in France]]&quot; and was carried with cheers. On the 22nd came the news of the [[Battle of Valmy]]. On the same day it was decreed that &quot;in future the acts of the assembly shall be dated ''First Year of the French Republic''&quot;. Three days later the corollary was added, to guard against federalism, that &quot;the French republic is one and indivisible&quot;. A republic had been proclaimed, but it remained to enact a republican government. The country was little more republican in feeling or practice than it had been before at any time since [[Flight to Varennes|Varennes]]. But now had to become a republic, because it no longer had a king.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=315}}

When the Convention met the military situation was undergoing an extraordinary transformation that seemed to confirm the Girondin prophecies of easy victory. After [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] the Prussians withdrew to the frontier, and in November French troops occupied the left bank of the [[Rhine]]. The Austrians, who had besieged [[Lille]] in October, were defeated by [[Charles François Dumouriez|Dumouriez]] at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November and evacuated the Austrian Netherlands. [[Nice]] was occupied and [[Savoy]] proclaimed its union with France. These successes made it safe to quarrel at home.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=157}}

===The Girondins and the Montagnards===

Most historians divide the National Convention into two main factions: the Girondins and the Montagnards. The Girondins were the more moderate conservatives at Convention. They protested the vast influences held at the Convention by Parisians. They drew their name from the Gironde, a region of France from which many of the deputies of this faction originated. They were also known as the Brissotins after their most prominent speaker, [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Jaques Pierre Brissot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Girondin|title=Girondin {{!}} political group, France|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montagnards represented a considerably larger, more democratic, portion of the deputies. They were much more radical than the Girondins and held strong connections to the Jacobin Club of Paris They drew their name from the high bleachers that they sat on while the Convention was in session. The Montagnards dominated the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Benjamin|date=2004|title=Polling the Opinions: A Reexamination of Mountain, Plain, and Gironde in the National Convention|jstor=40267833|journal=Social Science History|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three questions dominated the first months of the Convention: revolutionary violence; the trial of the king; and Parisian dominance of politics.

Antagonism between Paris and the provinces created friction among the people that served as a propaganda tool and combat weapon for the two groups. The departments resisted the idea of centralization. They saw this idea being symbolized by the desire to reduce the capital of the Revolution to its one-eighty-third share of influence. Much of the Gironde wished to remove the Assembly from a city dominated by &quot;agitators and flatterers of the people&quot;: it did not at the time encourage an aggressive federalism that would have run counter to its political ambitions.{{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=51}}

=== The Plain ===
The Plain was a third faction during the Convention. Though some historians consider these men to be closely associated with the Girondins, the Plain was much more centrist in their ideals.The Plain held the largest group of deputies and derived their name from their place on the floor of the Convention. During the start of the Convention, they sided with the Girondins, however, as it progressed and the Montagnards began to push for the execution of Louis, the Plain began to side with them.

===The Trial of the King===
{{Main article|Trial of Louis XVI}}
{{quote|Louis must die so that the nation may live.|[[Maximilien Robespierre]]&lt;ref&gt;Bouloiseau, et al. &quot;Oeuvres de Maximillien Robespierre,&quot; pp.129–130, Tome IX, Discours.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:ExaminationLouistheLast.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The trial of Louis XVI]]

From the opening of the Convention the Girondins showed no inclination to bring the king to trial. They were more interested in discrediting Paris and its deputies. Their decision to hound the Jacobins was not merely a choice of priorities; they genuinely wanted to spare the king.{{sfn|Jordan|1979|p=59}} But in reality the Convention had to declare him guilty if it wanted to avoid damning 10 August 1792, its own existence, and the proclamation of the Republic. &quot;If the king is not guilty, then those who have dethroned him are&quot;, as Robespierre remarked on 2 December. Once the Convention recognized Louis's guilt it could hardly refuse to pronounce the death penalty against a person who had summoned the aid of foreign powers and whom the ''[[sans-culottes]]'' considered responsible for the [[10 August (French Revolution)#Assault on the Tuileries|ambush at the Tuileries]].{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=270}}

The discovery of the [[Armoire de fer|iron chest]] in the Tuileries 20 November 1792 made the trial inevitable. Documents found in this secret chest proved without any doubt the treachery of Louis XVI.

The trial began on 10 December. The Montagnards put the debate on the ideological level. Louis XVI was classified as an enemy, alien to the body of the nation and as a &quot;usurper&quot;. Balloting began on 14 January 1793. Each deputy explained his vote at the rostrum. The vote against the king was unanimous. There was to be no popular referendum as Girondins hoped. The fatal vote started on 16 January and continued until the next day. Of the 721 deputies present, 387 declared themselves for the death penalty, while 334 were opposed. 26 deputies voted for death on condition that he was reprieved. On 18 January the question of reprieve was put to a vote: 380 votes were cast against; 310 for. Each time the Girondins had split.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=284}}

{{Main article|Execution of Louis XVI}}

On the morning of 21 January the Convention ordered the entire National Guard to line both sides of the route to the scaffold. Louis was beheaded at the Place de la Revolution. Within the nation, &quot;voters&quot; and &quot;appellants&quot;, those that were against the execution of Louis,{{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=This term is not defined anywhere in the text}} swore undying hatred of each other. The rest of Europe, fearing the outcome of the French Revolution in their own countries, decreed a war of extermination against regicides.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=272}}{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|As opposed to the English Revolution, the French Revolution killed not only the king of France, but royalty itself. In this sense, even if the ''Conventionnels'' had only transformed into a national tragedy what the last century of absolutism had already marked out as inevitable, they had accomplished their aim: to strip royalty from the nation's future. By executing the king, they had severed France's last ties with her past, and made the rupture with the ''ancien régime'' complete.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=122}}}}

=== The Crisis and Fall of the Girondins ===

The Assembly began harmoniously, but within a few days the Girondins launched a bitter attack on their Montagnard opponents. Conflict continued without interruption until the expulsion of the Girondin leaders from the Convention on 2 June 1793. The Girondins had relied on votes from the majority of the deputies, many of whom were alarmed as well as scandalized by the [[September massacres]], but their insistence on monopolizing all positions of authority during the Convention, and their attacks on the Montagnard leaders, soon irritated them, causing them to regard the party as a faction. One by one, able deputies such as [[Couthon]], [[Pierre-Joseph Cambon|Cambon]], [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]], [[Lindet]] and [[Barere]] began to gravitate towards the Montagnards, while the majority – the Plain, as it was called – held itself aloof from both sides.

Girondins were convinced that their opponents aspired to a bloody dictatorship, while the Montagnards believed that the Girondins were ready for any compromise with conservatives, and even royalists, that would guarantee their remaining in power. The bitter enmity soon reduced the Convention to a state of limbo. Debate after debate degenerated into verbal brawling from which no decision could emerged. The political deadlock, which had repercussions all over France, eventually drove men to accept dangerous allies, royalists in the case of Girondins, Jacobins in that of the Montagnards.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=157}}

Thus the struggle within the Convention continued without results. The decision was to come from outside.
[[File:RiotsMay31-June2 1793.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Journées des 31 Mai 1er et 2 Juin 1793'']]
Since the king's trial, the [[sans-culottes]] had been constantly assailing the &quot;appealers&quot; (''appelants''), and quickly came to desire their expulsion from the Convention. If this were achieved, the government could recover the energy to enable it to deal with the aristocratic plot by arresting suspects and establishing a revolutionary tribunal.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=42}} Military setbacks from [[the First Coalition]], [[Charles François Dumouriez|Dumouriez's]] treason and the [[war in the Vendée]], which began in March 1793, were all used as arguments by Montagnards and ''sans-culottes'' to portray Girondins as soft. They demanded that the Girondins take measures to change thing, but the Girondins were reluctant to adopt the proposed measures. The Girondins were forced to accept the Montagnards creation of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. Social and economic difficulties exacerbated the tensions between the groups. The final showdown was precipitated by [[Jean-Paul Marat]]'s trial and the arrest of sectional activists.

On 25 May the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]] demanded that arrested patriots be released. In reply, [[Maximin Isnard|Isnard]], who was presiding over the Convention, launched into a diatribe against Paris which was reminiscent of the [[Brunswick Manifesto]]: &quot;If any attack made on the persons of the representatives of the nation, then I declare to you in the name of the whole country that Paris would be destroyed&quot;. On the next day the Jacobins declared themselves in a state of insurrection. On 28 May the ''Cité'' section called the other sections to a meeting in order to organize the insurrection. On 29 May the delegates representing 33 of the sections formed an insurrectionary committee of nine members.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=309}}

{{Main article|Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793}}

On 2 June, 80,000 armed ''sans-culottes'' surrounded the Convention. After an attempt of deputies to leave collided with guns, the deputies resigned themselves to declare the arrest of 29 leading Girondins. In this way the Gironde ceased to be a political force. It had declared war without knowing how to conduct it; it had denounced the King but had shrunk from condemning him; it had contributed to the worsening of the economic crisis but had swept aside all the claims made by the popular movement.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=311}}

== Montagnard Convention ==
{{quote|''Unité, Indivisibilité de la République; Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité ou la mort''|Summer 1793{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=356}}}}

Scarcely had the Gironde been eliminated when the Convention, now under Montagnard leadership, found itself caught between two threats. While forces of counter-revolution were gaining new impetus from the federalist revolt, the popular movement, roused to fury by high prices, was increasing the pressure it exercised on the government. Meanwhile, the Government was proving incapable of controlling the situation. In July 1793 the nation appeared to be on the point of falling apart.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=313}}

=== Constitution 1793 ===
{{Main article|French Constitution of 1793}}
[[File:Constitution 1793.JPG|thumb|Constitution du Peuple Française du 6 Messidor l'an I (24 June 1793)]]

During the month of June the Montagnards played for time. Yet the Convention did not overlook the peasants. It was to these latter that the revolution of 31 May (like those of 14 July and 10 August) brought a substantial and permanent profit. On 3 June the sale of the property of emigrants, in small parcels and payable in ten years, was decreed; on the 10th, the optional division of common lands by head; and on 17 July, the abolition, without compensation, of all that remained of manorial rights.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=55}}

The Montagnards attempted to reassure the middle classes by rejecting any idea of terror, by protecting property rights, and by restricting the popular movement to very narrowly circumscribed limits. It was a delicate balance to achieve, a balance that was destroyed in July by the worsening of the crisis. The Convention rapidly approved the new constitution, hoping to clear itself of the charge of dictatorship and calm the anxieties of the departments''.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=314}}

The Declaration of Rights which precedes the text of the Constitution solemnly reaffirmed the nation's indivisibility and the great principles of freedom of the press, equality and resistance to oppression. It went far beyond the Declaration of 1789, adding to it the right to public assistance, work, education and insurrection. No man could impose his will on others. All political and social tyranny was abolished. Although the ''montagnards'' had refused to be led further down the road to democracy, the Constitution became the bible of all democrats.{{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=67}}

The chief aim of the Constitution was to ensure the major role of the deputies in the Convention, which was seen as being the essential basis for political democracy. The Legislative Assembly was to be elected by direct vote cast for a single member; deputies were elected on receiving a simple majority of the votes cast, and the assembly would sit for one year. The executive council of 24 members was chosen by the Legislative Assembly from among the 83 candidates chosen by the departments on the basis of universal male suffrage, and in this way ministers were made responsible to the representatives of the nation. The exercise of national sovereignty was widened through the institution of the referendum – the Constitution was to be ratified by the people, as were laws in certain precisely defined circumstances.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=316}}

The Constitution was submitted for popular ratification and adopted by a huge margin of more than 1,801,918 in favour to some 17,610 against. The results of the plebiscite were made public on 10 August 1793, but the application of the Constitution, the text of which was placed in the sacred ark and laid in the debating-chamber of the Convention, was postponed until peace had been made.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=338}}

=== Federalist revolt, war and counter-revolution ===
[[File:Death of Marat by David.jpg|thumb|left|La Mort de Marat&lt;br/&gt;[[Jacques-Louis David]], 1793, Brussels|190px]]
Indeed, the Montagnards faced dramatic circumstances – federalist insurrection, war in the Vendée, military failures, and a worsening economic situation. Despite everything, a new civil war could not be avoided.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=55}} By the middle of June, about sixty departments were in more or less open rebellion. Fortunately the frontier departments had remained faithful to the Convention. The rising was widespread rather than deep. It was essentially the work of the departmental and district administrations. The communes, which were more popular in composition, showed themselves in general lukewarm or hostile; and federalist leaders soon became divided among themselves. Sincere republicans among them could not fail to be uneasy about the foreign invasion and the Vendée. Those who were seeing themselves rejected by the people, sought support from the moderates, the Feuillants and even from the aristocrats.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=336}}

July and August were bad months on the frontiers. Within three weeks [[Mainz]], the symbol of previous successes, capitulated to the Prussians, and the Austrians captured the fortresses of [[Condé-sur-l'Escaut|Condé]] and [[Valenciennes]] and invaded northern France. Spanish troops crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and began advancing on [[Perpignan]]. The [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] took advantage of the diversion of republican forces at [[Lyons]] in order to invade France from the East. In [[Corsica]], [[Pasquale Paoli|Paoli]]'s revolt expelled the French from the island with British support. British troops opened the siege of [[Dunkirk]] in August and in October the Allies invaded [[Alsace]]. The military situation had become desperate.

In addition there were other incidents which compounded the fury of the revolutionaries and convinced them that their opponents had abandoned all restraint of civilized behavior. On 13 July, [[Charlotte Corday]] murdered ''sans-culotte'' idol [[Jean-Paul Marat]]. She had been in touch with Girondin rebels in [[Normandy]] and they were believed to have used her as their agent.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=189}}

The lack of forethought displayed by the Convention during the first few days was redeemed by its vigor and skill in organizing measures of repression. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the rebellious Girondin leaders; the members of the revolting departmental administration were deprived of their office.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=337}}

The regions in which the revolt was dangerous were precisely those in which a large number of royalists had remained. There was no room for a third party between the Mountain, which was identified with the Republic, and royalism, which was the ally of the enemy. The royalist insurrection in the Vendée had already led the Convention to take a long step in the direction of the Terror – that is to say, the dictatorship of central power and the suppression of liberties. The Girondin insurrection now prompted it to take a decisive step in the same direction.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=340}}

=== Revolutionary government ===
{{quote|The provisional government of France is revolutionary until there is peace.|The decree of 10 December 1793{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=134}}}}
[[File:Le Départ des Volontaires (La Marseillaise) par Rude, Arc de Triomphe Etoile Paris.jpg|thumb|''[[La Marseillaise]]'' par [[François Rude]]]]
The Constituent Assembly had legislated through its commissions. The Convention governed by means of its [[Commissioners of the Committee of Public Safety#Committees|committees]]. Two of them were of essential importance: [[Committee of Public Safety|Public Safety]] and [[Committee of General Security|General Security]]. The second, which had formidable powers, is less well known than the first, which was the true executive authority and was armed with immense prerogatives. It dated from April, but its composition was thoroughly reshuffled during the summer of 1793.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=132}}

The summer of 1793 saw ''sans-culotte'' disturbances reach a peak under a double banner: price-fixing and terror. On top of this came the news of unprecedented treason: [[Toulon]] and its squadron had been handed over to the enemy.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=68}} In the name of the wretched poverty of the people, the leaders of the [[Enragés]], with [[Jacques Roux]] at their head, called for a planned economy from a Convention which had no liking for the idea. But the revolutionary logic of the mobilization of resources by national dictatorship was infinitely more powerful than economic doctrine. In August, a series of decrees gave the authorities discretionary powers over the production and circulation of grain, as well as ferocious punishments for fraud. &quot;Granaries of plenty&quot; were prepared, to stock corn requisitioned by authorities in each district. On 23 August the decree on the ''[[levée en masse]]'' turned able-bodied civilians into soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/50931/156.pdf?sequence=1|title=From Mobilization to Revolution|last=|first=|date=March 1977|website=|publisher=Charles Tilly University of Michigan|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September, Parisians tried to repeat the revolt of 2 June. Armed ''sections'' again encircled the Convention to demand the setting up of an internal revolutionary army, the arrest of suspects and a purge of the committees. It was probably the key day in the formation of the revolutionary government: the convention yielded, but kept control of events. It put Terror on the agenda on 5 September, on 6th elected [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Billaud-Varenne]] to the Committee of Public Safety, on the 9th created the revolutionary army, on the 11th decreed the [[General maximum|Maximum]] for grain and fodder (general controls for prices, and wages on the 29th), on the 14th reorganized the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], on the 17th voted in the law on suspects, and on the 20th gave the local revolutionary committees the task of drawing up lists of them.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=134}}

The dictatorship of the Convention and the committees, simultaneously supported and controlled by the Parisian sections, representing the sovereign people in permanent session, lasted from June to September. It governed through a network of institutions set up haphazardly since spring in March, the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] and representatives on missions in the departments; was followed the next month by the Convention's representatives to the armies, also armed with unlimited powers; and enforced acceptance of ''assignat'' as the sole legal tender, price controls for grain and the forced loan of a billion livres from the rich.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=133}}

At last France saw a government take shape. [[Georges Danton|Danton]] resigned from it on 10 July. [[Couthon]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], [[Jean Bon Saint-André|Jeanbon Saint-Andre]], and [[Pierre Louis Prieur|Prieur of the Marne]] formed a nucleus of resolute Montagnards who rallied [[Barrere]] and [[Lindet]], then successfully added [[Robespierre]] on 27 July, [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] and [[Claude Antoine, comte Prieur-Duvernois|Prieur of Cote-d'Ore]] on 14 August, and [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Billaud-Varenne]] on 6 September. They had a few clear ideas to which they clung: to command, to fight, and to conquer. Their work in common, the danger, the taste of and pride in power created solidarity that made the Committee an autonomous organism.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=62}}

The committee was always managed collegially, despite the specific nature of the tasks of each director: the division into &quot;politicians&quot; and &quot;technicians&quot; was a Thermidorian invention, intended to lay the corpses of the Terror at the door of the Robespierrists alone. Many things, however, set the twelve committee members at loggerheads; Barrere was more a man of the Convention than of the committee and was a link with the Plaine. Robert Lindet had qualms about the Terror which, by contrast, was the outstanding theme of Collot d'Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, latecomers to the committee, forced on it by the ''sans-culottes'' in September; unlike Robespierre and his friends, Lazare Carnot had given his support only provisionally and for reasons of state to a policy concession to the people. But the situation which united them in the summer of 1793 was stronger than those differences of opinion.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=132}} The Committee had to set itself above all, and choose those popular demands which were most suitable for achieving the Assembly's aims: to crush the enemies of the Republic and dash the last hopes of the aristocracy. To govern in the name of the Convention, at the same time controlling it, and to restrain the people without quenching their enthusiasm — this was a gamble.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=64}}

The ensemble of institutions, measures and procedures which constituted it was codified in a decree of 14 Frimaire (4 December) which set the seal on what had been the gradual development of centralized dictatorship founded on the Terror. In the center was the Convention, whose secular arm was the Committee of Public Safety, vested with immense powers: it interpreted the Convention's decrees and settled their methods of application; under its immediate authority it had all state bodies and all civil servants (even ministers would disappear in April 1794); it directed military and diplomatic activity, appointed generals and members of other committees, subject to ratification by the Convention. It held responsibility for conducting war, public order and the provisioning of the population. The Commune of Paris, a famous ''sans-culotte'' bastion, was neutralized by coming under its control.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=134}}

====The economy====
Administrative and economic centralization went hand in hand. The state of siege forced France into [[autarky]]; to save the Republic the government mobilized all the nation's productive forces and reluctantly accepted the need for a controlled economy, which it introduced extemporaneously, as the emergency required.{{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=100}} It was necessary to develop war production, revive foreign trade, and find new resources in France itself; and time was short.  Circumstances gradually compelled it to assume the economic government of the country. Along with organization of the army, this was the most original feature of its work.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=100}}

All material resources were subjected to requisitioning. Farmers surrendered their grain, fodder, wool, flax, and hemp. Artisans and merchants gave up their manufactured products. Raw materials were carefully sought out – metal of all kinds, church bells, old paper, rags and parchments, grasses, brushwood, and even household ashes for manufacturing of potassium salts, and chestnuts for distilling. All businesses were placed at the disposal of the nation – forests, mines, quarries, furnaces, forges, tanneries, paper mills, large cloth factories and shoe making workshops. The labor of men and the value of things were subject to price controls. No one had a right to speculate at the cost of ''Patrie'' while it was in danger. Armaments caused more concern. As early as September 1793 efforts were made to create a large factory in Paris for rifles and sidearms.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=104}} A special appeal was made to scientists. [[Monge]], [[Vandermonde]], [[Berthollet]], [[Jean Darcet|Darcet]], [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy|Fourcroy]] perfected metallurgy and manufacture of arms.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=101}}

Only to the wage earners did the Maximum seem thoroughly advantageous. It increased wages by one-half in relation to 1790, and commodities by only one-third. But since the Committee did not ensure that it was respected (except for bread), they would have been duped had they not been benefiting from the favorable conditions that a great war always offers the labor force.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=109}} Still Paris became calmer, because the ''sans-culottes'' were gradually finding ways to subsist; the ''levée en masse'' and the formation of the revolutionary army were thinning their ranks; many now were working in arms and equipment shops, or in the offices of the committees and ministries, which were expanded enormously.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=71}}

====The Army of the Year II====
{{main article|French Revolutionary Army}}
{{quote|Surprise them like a flash of lightning and smash them like a thunderbolt.|[[Lazare Carnot]]{{sfn|Soboul |1974|p=403}}}}

During the summer the requisition of the levy was completed and by July the total strength of the army reached 650,000. The difficulties were tremendous. The war production just started in September. The army was in the middle of the purge. In the spring of 1794 the amalgamation was undertaken. Two battalions of volunteers joined one battalion of regulars to constitute a demi-brigade, or regiment. At the same time the command was reconstituted. The purge ended with most of the nobles excluded. The new generation reached the highest ranks, and the War College (''Ecole de Mars'') received six young men from each district to improve the staff. Army commanders were to be appointed by the Convention.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=96}}

What gradually emerged was a military command unequaled in quality: [[François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers|Marceau]], [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]], [[Jean Baptiste Kléber|Kleber]], [[André Masséna|Massena]], [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]], and a host of others, backed by officers who were sound both in their abilities as soldiers and in their sense of civic responsibility.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=400}} {{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|The revolutionaries turned soldiers did not forget their attachments. [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] had been a Maratist, [[Jean Baptiste Kléber|Kleber]] and [[François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers|Marceau]] praised the activity of [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier|Carrier]], and [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] attached himself to the Robespierre brothers. So many years later, even men like [[Marmont]] and [[Soult]] were moved with emotion by the memory of the shining hours they had known in the service of the &quot;Indivisible Republic&quot;.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=98}}}}
 
For the first time since antiquity a truly national army marched to war, and for the first time, too, a nation succeeded in arming and feeding great numbers of soldiers – these are the novel characteristics of the army of the Year II. The technical innovations resulted chiefly from its sheer size as well the strategy that developed from it. The old system of cordons lost its prestige. Moving between the armies of the Coalition, the French could maneuver along interior lines, deploy part of their troops along the frontiers, and take advantage of the inaction of any one of their enemies to beat the others. Acting ''en masse'', and overwhelming the foe by sheer numbers – such were Carnot's principles. They were still untried, and not until Bonaparte appeared did they enjoy any great success.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=99}}

=== Fall of the factions ===
As late as September 1793, there were two distinct wings among the revolutionaries. Firstly those who were later called [[Hébertists]] – although [[Jacques Hébert|Hébert]] himself was never the official leader of a party – advocated war to the death and adopted the program of the ''[[Enragés]]'', ostensibly because the ''sans-culottes'' approved it. The Hebertists preferred to side with the Montagnards, so long as they could hope to control the Convention through them. They dominated the [[Cordeliers Club]], filled [[Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte|Bouchotte's]] offices, and could generally carry the Commune with them.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=61}} The other wing was that of the [[Dantonists]], which formed in response to the increasing centralization of the Revolutionary Government and the dictatorship of the Committees. The Dantonists were led predominately by deputies of the Convention (rather than the sans-culottes), including [[Georges Danton|Danton]], [[Jean-François Delacroix|Delacroix]], and [[Desmoulins]].

Putting the needs of national defense above all other considerations, the Committee of Public Safety had no intentions of giving in to the demands of either the popular movement or the moderates. {{according to whom|reason=Is this the Committee's opinion? (Then cite a source for it.) Or a historian's? (Then say so and cite a source.)|date=November 2015| Following the Hebertists would jeopardize revolutionary unity, while the giving in to the demands of the moderates would have undermined the both the Terror and the controlled economy. However, unity, centralization, and the Terror were all considered essential to the war effort.}} In order to balance the contradictory demands of these two factions, the Revolutionary Government attempted to maintain a position halfway between the moderate Dantonists (''citras'') and the extremist Hebertists (''ultras'').{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=359}}

But at the end of the winter of 1793-4, the shortage of food took a sharp turn for the worse. The [[Hebertists]] incited ''sans-culottes'' to demand stringent measures, and at first the Committee did prove conciliatory. The Convention voted 10 million for relief,{{clarify|reason=10 million what? Livres, votes?|date=November 2015}} on 3 Ventose, [[Barere]] presented a new general Maximum, and on the 8th [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] obtained a decree confiscating the property of suspects and distributing it to the needy (Ventose decrees). The Hebertists felt that if they increased the pressure, they would triumph once and for all. Although the call appeared like one for insurrection it was probably just for a new demonstration, like the one in September. But the Committee of Public Safety decided on 22 Ventose Year II (12 March 1794) that the [[Hebertists]] posed too serious a threat. The Committee linked [[Jacques Hébert|Hebert]], [[Charles-Philippe Ronsin|Ronsin]], [[François-Nicolas Vincent|Vincent]], and [[Antoine-François Momoro|Momoro]] to the emigres Proli, [[Anacharsis Cloots|Cloots]] and Pereira, so as to present the Hebertists as parties to the &quot;foreign plot&quot;. All were executed on 4 Germinal (24 March).{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=88}}  This move largely silenced the Hebertists, now without their leadership. Having succeeded in stifling dissent on the left, the Committee then turned on the Dantonists, several members of which were implicated in financial corruption. The Committee forced the Convention to lift the parliamentary immunity of nine Dantonist deputies, allowing them to be put on trial. On 5 April Dantonist leaders [[Georges Danton|Danton]], [[Jean-François Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Desmoulins]], and [[Pierre Philippeaux|Philippeaux]] were executed.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=220}}

The execution of the leaderships of both rival factions caused some to become disillusioned. Many ''sans-culottes'' were stunned by the Hebertists' execution. All the positions of influence traditionally held by the sans-culottes were eliminated: the Revolutionary Army was disbanded, the inspectors of food-hoarding were dismissed, [[Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte|Bouchotte]] lost the War Office, the [[Cordeliers Club]] was forced to self-censor and the Government pressure brought about closing 39 popular societies. The Paris Commune, controlled by sans-culottes, was purged and filled with Committee nominees. With the execution of the [[Dantonists]], many of the members of the National Convention lost trust in the Committee, and even began to fear for their personal safety.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=221}}

Ultimately, the Committee had undermined its own support by eliminating the Dantonists and Hebertists, both of which had backed the Committee. By compelling the Convention to allow the arrests of the [[Girondins]] and [[Dantonists]], the Committee believed it had destroyed its major opposition. However, the trials demonstrated the Committee's lack of respect for members of the Convention (several of whom had been executed). Many Convention members who had sided with the Committee in the past by mid-1794 no longer supported it. The Committee had acted as mediator between the Convention and the ''sans-culottes'' from which they both had acquired their strength. By executing the Hebertists and alienating the ''sans-culottes'', the Committee became unnecessary to the Assembly.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=90}}

=== The Terror ===
{{Main article|Reign of Terror}}
{{quote|That which constitutes a Republic is the total destruction of that which opposes it.|[[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]]{{sfn|Greer|1935|p=19}}}}

Though the Terror was organized in September 1793, it was not introduced until October. It had resulted from a popular movement A new chapter of the Revolutionary Tribunal was opened after 5 September, divided into four sections: the Committees of [[Committee of Public Safety|Public Safety]] and [[Committee of General Security|General Security]] were to propose the names of judges and jurymen; [[Fouquier-Tinville]] stayed as public prosecutor, and [[Martial Joseph Armand Herman|Herman]] was nominated president.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=341}} The Terror was meant to discourage support for the enemies of the Revolution by condemning outspoken critics of the Montagnards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror|title=Reign of Terror {{!}} French history|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great political trials began in October. The queen was guillotined on 16 October. A special decree stifled the defense of 21 Girondins, including [[Vergniaud]] and [[Brissot]], and they perished on the 31st.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=71}}

At the summit of the apparatus of the Terror sat the [[Committee of General Security]], the state's second organization. It consisted of twelve members elected each month by the Convention, and vested with security, surveillance and police functions, including over civil and military authorities. It employed a large staff, headed the gradually constituted network of local revolutionary committees, and applied the law on suspects by sifting through the thousands of local denunciations and arrests which it then had to try.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=135}}

It struck down the enemies of the Republic whoever and wherever they were. It was socially indiscriminate and politically perspicacious. Its victims belonged to the classes which hated the Revolution or lived in the regions where rebellion was most serious. &quot;The severity of repressive measures in the provinces,&quot; wrote Mathiez, &quot;was in direct proportion to danger of revolt.&quot;{{sfn|Greer|1935|p=19}} Many outspoken members of the community were tried and executed for claims of treason: [[Camille Desmoulins]] and [[Georges Danton]] were two of the more notable men executed for their &quot;threats&quot; against the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror|title=Reign of Terror {{!}} French history|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputies sent as &quot;representatives on mission&quot; by the [[Committee of Public Safety]], armed with full powers, reacted according to both the local situation and their own temperaments: [[Lindet]] pacified the Girondin west in July without a single death sentence; in Lyon, some months later, [[Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Joseph Fouche]] relied on frequent summary executions by shooting because the guillotine was not working swiftly enough.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=138}}{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|Based on recent figures of the Terror:&lt;br /&gt;17,000 victims names distributed according to specific geographical areas: 52% in the Vendee, 19% in the south-east, 10% in the capital and 13% in the rest of France. Distinction is between zones of turmoil and an insignificant proportion of quite rural areas. Between departments, the contrast becomes more striking. Some were hard hit, the Loire-Inferieure, the Vendee, the Maine-et-Loire, the Rhone and Paris. In six departments no executions were recorded; in 31, there were fewer than 10; in 32, fewer than 100; and only in 18 were there more than 1,000. Charges of rebellion and treason were by far the most frequent grounds for execution (78%), followed by federalism (10%), crimes of opinion (9%) and economic crimes (1.25%). Artisans, shopkeepers. wage-earners and humble folk made up the largest contingent (31%), concentrated in Lyons, Marseilles and neighboring small towns. Because of the peasant rebellion in the Vendée, peasants are more heavily represented (28%) than the federalist and merchant bourgeoisie. Nobles (8.25%) and priests (6.5%), who would seem to have been relatively spared, actually provided a higher proportion of victims than other social categories. In the most sheltered regions, they were the only victims. Furthermore, the &quot;Great Terror&quot; is hardly distinguishable from the rest. In June and July 1794, it accounted for 14% of executions, as against 70% from October 1793 to May 1794, and 3.5% before September 1793. if one adds executions without trial and deaths in prison, a total of 50,000 seems likely, that is 2 per 1,000 of the population.{{sfn|Bouloiseau |1983|p=210}}}}

=== Thermidor ===
{{quote|The Revolution has grown cold; all its principles are weakened; there remains only red caps worn by intriguers.|[[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]]{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=288}}}}
[[File:Max Adamo Sturz Robespierres.JPG|thumb|300px|9 Thermidor]]
The Jacobin dictatorship could only hope to remain in power so long as it was dealing successfully with a national emergency. As soon as its political opponents had been destroyed, and its foreign enemies defeated, it would lose the chief force that kept it together. The Jacobin fall happened more rapidly than expected because of issues within the party.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=502}}

So long as it remained united, the Committee was virtually invulnerable, but it had scarcely attained the apogee of its power before signs of internal conflict appeared.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=229}} The Committee of Public Safety had never been a homogeneous body. It was a coalition cabinet. Its members were kept together less by comradeship or common ideals than by calculation and routine. The press of business which at first prevented personal quarrels also produced tired nerves. Trifling differences were exaggerated into the issues of life and death. Small disputes estranged them from one another.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=508}} [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]], in particular, was irritated by the criticisms directed at his plans by Robespierre and Saint-Just, Dispute followed dispute.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=134}}  Bickering broke out on the Committee of Public Safety, with Carnot describing Robespierre and Saint-Just as &quot;ridiculous dictators&quot; and Collot making veiled attacks on the &quot;Incorruptible&quot;. From the end of June until 23 July Robespierre ceased to attend the Committee.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=229}}

Realizing the danger of fragmentation, they attempted a reconciliation. Saint-Just and Couthon favored it, but Robespierre doubted sincerity of his enemies. It was he who brought about the fatal intervention of the Convention. On 8 Thermidor, Year II (26 July 1794), he denounced his opponents, and demanded that &quot;unity of government&quot; be realized. When called upon to name those whom he was accusing, however, he refused. This failure destroyed him, for it was assumed that he was demanding a blank cheque.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=134}} This night an uneasy alliance was formed from threatened deputies and members of The Plain. On the next day, 9 Thermidor, Robespierre and his friends were not allowed to speak, and their indictment was decreed. The men of the extreme left played the leading roles: [[Billaud-Varenne]], who attacked, and [[Collot d'Herbois]], who presided.

On hearing the news the Paris Commune, loyal to the man who had inspired it, called for an insurrection and released the arrested deputies in the evening and mobilized two or three thousand militants.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=150}} The night of 9–10 Thermidor was one of great confusion in Paris, as Commune and Assembly competed for the support of the sections and their troops. The Convention proclaimed that the rebels were henceforth outlaws; [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] was given the task of mustering an armed force, and the moderate sections gave this their support. The National Guardsmen and artillerymen assembled outside the ''Hotel de Ville'' were left without instructions and little by little they dispersed and left the square deserted. Around two o'clock in the morning a column from Gravilliers section led by [[Léonard Bourdon]] burst in the ''Hotel de Ville'' and arrested insurgents.

On the evening of 10 Thermidor (28 July 1794), [[Robespierre]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], [[Couthon]] and nineteen of their political allies were executed without trial. On the following day it was the turn of a large batch of 71 men, the largest mass execution in the entire course of the Revolution.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=411–412}}

== Thermidorian Convention ==
Whatever reasons the conspirators had behind 9 Thermidor, the events afterwards went beyond their intentions. Evidently the remaining members on the Committees counted on staying in office and currying the favour of the Jacobin dictatorship, as though nothing more had happened than a party purge.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=516}}

=== Thermidorian Reaction ===
{{Main article|Thermidorian Reaction}}
They were speedily disabused of this notion. Robespierrists might go out and Dantonists come in; the Convention had recovered its initiative and would put an end, once and for all, to the dictatorial committees government which had ousted it from power. It was decreed that no member of governing committees should hold office for more than four months. Three days later the [[Law of 22 Prairial|Prairial Law]] was repealed and the Revolutionary Tribunal shorn of its abnormal powers. The Commune was replaced with a Commission of Civil Administrators (''commission des administrateurs civils'') from the ranks of the Conventions. In November the Jacobin club was closed. Not merely anti-Robespierrist but anti-Jacobin reaction was in full flood. At the beginning of September [[Billaud]], [[Collot d'Herbois|Collot]] and [[Barere]] left the Committee of Public Safety; by the end of the year they were in prison.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=516}}

The stability of the government was weakening. Next came the concentration of power, another revolutionary principle. The identification of the Committee of Public Safety with the executive was ended on 7 Fructidor (24 August), restricting it to its former domain of war and diplomacy. The Committee of General Security kept its control over the police. There was now to be a total of sixteen committees. ''Conventionnels'', while aware of the dangers of fragmentation, were even more worried by its experience of monopoly of powers. In a few weeks the revolutionary government was dismantled.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=2}}

These measures affected, finally, the instruments of the Terror and opened numerous breaches in the apparatus of repression. The [[law of 22 Prairial]] was repealed, the prisons were opened and &quot;suspects&quot; were released: 500 in Paris in a single week. A few public trials were staged — including those of [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier|Carrier]], held responsible for the mass-drowning at [[Nantes]], and [[Fouquier-Tinville]], notorious as the public prosecutor of the Great Terror of the late spring and summer of 1794 – after which the Revolutionary Tribunal was quietly put aside.{{sfn|Rude|1988|p=115}}{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|Yet an unofficial Terror-in-reverse continued. In the provinces the Terror assumed violent and vicious form. In the [[Lyonnais]], the Company of Jesus flung the bodies of its victims, men and women, into the [[Rhone]], and prisoners were massacred wholesale in gaol or on their way to prison, while in other cities, bands of so-called Companies of Jehu and the Sun indiscriminately murdered &quot;terrorists&quot;, &quot;patriots of '89&quot; and – most eagerly of all – purchasers of former Church properties. Such excesses were deplored in Paris, but the Convention and its Committees were powerless to contain forces that they had themselves done much to unleash.{{sfn|Rude|1988|p=115}}}}

The destruction of the system of revolutionary government eventually brought about the end of the Economic Terror. ''Maximum'' was relaxed even before 9 Thermidor. Now nobody believed in it any longer. Because the black market was plentifully supplied, the idea took hold that price control equalled scarcity and that free trade would bring back abundance. It was generally supposed that prices would rise but that then they would fall as a result of competition. This illusion was to be shattered in the winter. Formally the Convention put the end to the ''maximum'' on 4 Nivose Year III (24 December 1794).{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=9–10}}

The abandonment of the controlled economy provoked a frightful catastrophe. Prices soared and the rate of exchange fell. The Republic was condemned to massive inflation and its currency was ruined. In Thermidor, Year III, ''assignats'' were worth less than 3% of their face value. Neither peasants nor merchants would accept anything but cash. The debacle was so swift that economic life seemed to come to standstill.

The crisis was greatly aggravated by famine. Peasants, finally, stopped bringing any produce, because they did not wish to accept ''assignats''. The government continued to provision Paris, but was unable to supply the promised rations. In provinces local municipalities resorted to some sort of regulations, provided not direct coercion in obtaining provisions. The misery of rural day laborers, abandoned by everyone, was often appalling. Inflation ruined creditors to the advantage of debtors. It unleashed an unprecedented speculation.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1963|p=142–143}}

At the beginning of spring, scarcity was such that more unrest appeared almost everywhere. Paris was active again.

=== Crushing of the popular movement ===
{{quote|Bread and Constitution of 1793|''Journees'' rallying slogan{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=444}}}}
[[File:1er prairial an III.jpg|thumb|Journée du 1er Prairial de l'an III|300px]]
Discontent increased along with the shortages. On 17 March a delegation from ''faubourgs Saint-Marceau and Saint-Jacques'' complained that &quot;We are on the verge of regretting all the sacrifices that we have made for the Revolution.&quot; Police law was passed which lay down the death penalty for use of seditious language. Arms were distributed to the &quot;good citizens&quot;, the faithful nucleus of the National Guard. The trial of strength was approaching.

{{Main article|Insurrection of 12 Germinal, Year III}}
On 10 Germinal (30 March) all the sections called their general assemblies. The political geography of Paris emerged clearly from this. Convention debate was centered on two issues: the fate of [[Barere]], [[Collot d'Herbois|Collot]], [[Billaud]] and [[Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier|Vadier]], and the implementation of the constitution of 1793. While in the sections of the center and the west formal addresses called for the punishment of the &quot;Four&quot; and passed over the food shortages, the sections of the east and the ''faubourgs'' demanded measures to deal with the grain crisis, the implementation of the constitution of 1793, the reopening of the popular societies and the release of the imprisoned patriots.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=15}}

On the morning of 12 Germinal (1 April) crowds gathered on the ''Ile de la Cité'' and, pushing aside the palace guards, burst into the chamber where the Convention met. Amidst the uproar, spokesmen of the sections outlined the people's grievances. Reliable battalions of National Guard were called and demonstrators, lacking arms and leaders, were forced to withdraw. For the most people it was the constitution of 1793 – seen as a liberating utopia – which represented the solution to all evils. There were others who openly regretted the passing of &quot;the reign of Robespierre&quot;.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=17}}

{{Main article|Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III|l1=Insurrection of 1 Prairial}}
But it was not the end. A new explosion was on the horizon. Insurrection was being openly prepared. On 1 Prairial (20 May 1795) the alarm bells sounded in the ''faubourgs'' [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine|Saint-Antoine]] and Marceau. The armed battalions arrived at Place du Carousel and entered the sitting chamber. After an hour of uproar, &quot;The Insurrection of the People&quot; (''L'Insurection du Peuple'') was read. In the chaos, none of the ringleaders thought of implementing the key item of the program: the overthrow of the government.

The remainder of the Montagnards, The Crest (''la Crête de la Montagne''), managed to obtain the passage of decrees favorable to the rebels. But at 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. two armed columns entered the chamber and cleared out the rioters. The next day insurgents repeated the same mistakes and after receiving promises from the deputies to take speedy measures against the famine, returned to the sections.

On 3 Prairial the government assembled loyal troops, chasseurs and dragoons, national guardsmen, selected from those &quot;who had fortune to preserve&quot; — 20,000 men in all. Faubourg Saint-Antoine was surrounded and on 4 Prairial surrendered and was disarmed. Uncertainty about how to react, hesitancy in action, and lack of revolutionary leadership had doomed the popular movement to throw away its last chance in battle.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=20}}

4 Prairial Year III is one of the crucial dates of the revolutionary period. The people had ceased to be a political force, participants in history. They were now no more than victims or spectators.

=== Constitution of the Year III ===
{{Main article|Constitution of the Year III}}
{{quote|A middle way between royalty and anarchy.|[[Antoine Claire Thibaudeau|Antoine Thibaudeau]]{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=29}}}}

[[File:Constitution 1795.jpg|left|thumb|Constitution 1795|Constitution de la République Française du 5 Fructidor l'an III (22 août 1795)]]
The victors now could set up a new constitution, the task the National Convention was originally elected for. The Commission of Eleven (the most notable members of which were [[Daunou]], [[Lanjuinais]], [[François Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas|Boissy d'Anglas]], [[Antoine Claire Thibaudeau|Thibaudeau]] and [[Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux|La Révellière]]) drafted a text which would reflect the new balance of power. It was presented on 5 Messidor (23 June) and passed on 22 August 1795 (5 Fructidor of the Year III).

The new constitution went back to the constitution of 1791 as to the dominant ideology of the country. Equality was certainly confirmed, but within the limits of civil equality. Numerous democratic rights of the constitution 1793 – the right to work, to relief, to education – were omitted. The Convention wanted to define rights and simultaneously reject both the privilege of the old order and social leveling.

The constitution went back to the distinction between active and passive citizens. Only citizens over twenty-five years old, disposing of an income of two hundred days of work, were eligible to be electors. This electoral body, which held the real power, included 30,000 people, half as many as in 1791. Guided by recent experience, institutions were set up to protect the Republic from two dangers: the omnipotence of an assembly and dictatorship.

Bicameral legislature as a precaution against sudden political fluctuations was proposed: the [[Council of Five Hundred]] with rights to propose laws and Council of the Ancients, 250 deputies, with powers to accept or reject proposed laws. Executive power was to be shared between five Directors chosen by the Ancients from the list drawn by Five Hundred. One of the Directors would be renewed each year with re-election after five years. As one of the practical precautions, no military were allowed within 60 miles of the sitting assembly and it could relocate in case of danger. The Directory still retained great power, including emergency powers to curb freedom of the press and freedom of association.

The Constitution generally was accepted favorably, even by those on the right, who were hopeful for the upcoming elections and even more happy to get rid of the legislative body so hated by them.

But how to make sure that the new elected body would not overturn the constitution as it was before with Legislative Assembly? Thermidorians attempted this on 5 Fructidor (22 August) by voting for a decree on &quot;formation of a new legislative body&quot;. Article II stipulated: &quot;All members presently active in the Convention are re-eligible. Election assemblies may not take fewer than two-thirds of them to form the legislative body&quot;. This was known as the Law of the Two-Thirds.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=166}}

[[File:13Vendémiaire.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Napoleon Bonaparte quelling of the Royalist revolt 13 Vendémiaire'', in front of the [[Église Saint-Roch]], rue Saint-Honoré.]]
On 23 September the results were announced: the constitution was accepted by 1,057,390 votes, with 49,978 against. The Two-Thirds decrees obtained only 205,498 votes in favor and 108,754 against.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=247}}

But the Convention had not taken into account those Paris sections who were against Two-Thirds decrees and failed to provide precise vote figures: 47 Parisian sections had rejected the decrees.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=31}} Eighteen of the Paris sections contested the result. The ''Lepeletier'' section issued a call to insurrection. By 11 Vendemiaire seven sections were in state of revolt, sections which were the base of the Convention since 9 Thermidor and now won by the far right if not royalists. The Convention declared itself permanent.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=473}} The ''conventionnels'' knew the score. They knew the art of insurrection by heart and to bring down ''[[muscadins]]'' was easier than the ''sans-culottes''.{{sfn|Furet|1996|p=167}} Five members including [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Barras]] were appointed to deal with the crisis. A decree of 12 Vendemiaire (4 October) repealed the former disarmament of the former terrorists and an appeal to ''sans-culottes'' was issued.{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|Barras reference to &quot;Faubourg Saint-Antoin whose attachment to the cause of liberty is well known&quot; in subsequent report offers curious commentary to the official evolution since journees of prairial.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=247}}}}

During the nights of Vendemiaire 12-13 (October 4–5), General Jacques de Menou de Boussay was tasked with putting down the royalist rebels and keep them from attacking the Convention. He recruited other generals to help aid in quelling the insurrection such as, Napoleon Bonaparte. The rebels outnumbered the Army by the thousands, but because of their preparations the night before, Bonaparte and the armies were able to line the road into Paris with cannons from Sablons Camp. Without a way into Paris, the rebels surrendered to the Convention on Vendemiaire 13. Barras and the Convention gave the armies permission to kill. Within 45 minutes over 300 royalist rebels were dead in front of the Church of Saint Roch. The rest had scattered and fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-empire.com/counter-revolution/13_vendemiaire.php|title=Napoleon and Counter-Revolutionary Royalists - 13 Vendémiaire Year 4 - Napoleon &amp; Empire|website=www.napoleon-empire.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moderate repression ensued and the [[First White Terror|White Terror]] in the south was stopped. On 4 Brumaire Year IV, just before breaking up, the Convention voted a general amnesty for &quot;deeds exclusively connected with the Revolution&quot;.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=473}}

== Legacy ==
The article on the Convention in the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] concludes, &quot;The work of the Convention was immense in all branches of public affairs. To appreciate it without prejudice, one should recall that this assembly saved France from a civil war and invasion, that it founded the system of public education (''Museum'', {{lang|fr|''[[École Polytechnique]]''}}, {{lang|fr|''[[École Normale Supérieure]]''}}, {{lang|fr|''[[École des langues orientales]]''}}, {{lang|fr|''[[Conservatoire]]''}}), created institutions of capital importance, like that of the {{lang|fr|''Grand Livre de la Dette publique''}}, and definitely established the social and political gains of the Revolution.&quot; By a decree of 4 February 1794 (16 pluviôse) it also ratified and expanded to the whole [[French colonial empire]] the 1793 [[Abolitionism in France|abolition of slavery]] on [[Saint-Domingue]] by civil commissioners [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax|Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel|Polverel]], though this did not affect [[Martinique]] or [[Guadeloupe]] and was abolished by the [[law of 20 May 1802]].

The '''Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793''' marks a significant milestone in the history of the [[French Revolution]]. The days of 31 May – 2 June ({{lang-fr|journées}}) resulted in the fall of the [[Girondin]] party under pressure of the Parisian ''[[sans-culottes]]'', [[Jacobins]] of the clubs, and [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] in the [[National Convention]]. By its impact and importance, the insurrection of 31 May – 2 June stands as one of the three great popular insurrections of the [[French Revolution]], following those of [[Storming of the Bastille|14 July 1789]] and [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]].{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=178}} 

== Background ==
Since the election of the [[National Convention]] eight long months had been squandered in &quot;scandalous&quot; debates that discredited the national representative body. France was expecting its Constitution; what it got was civil war, invasion and crisis so deep that it was shaking the nation to its foundation. The [[Gironde]] remained solidly established in the state bureaucracy and the provinces. It was because of the Gironde that the Assembly tempered the rigor of measures that local authorities pretended not to know about. At no other moment—except perhaps in the autumn of 1792—did the government have less influence and authority. The difficulties and dangers of the situation in the spring of 1793 were apparent.{{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=64}}{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|In an interesting letter to [[Danton]], dated 6 May, [[Tom Paine]] analysed the position as he saw it. He has stayed in France, he says, instead of returning to America, in the hope of seeing the principles of the revolution spread throughout Europe. Now he despairs of this event. The internal state of France is such that the revolution itself is in danger. The way in which the provincial deputies are insulted by the Parisians will lead to a rupture between the capital and departments, unless the Convention is moved elsewhere. France should profit by American experience in this matter, and hold its Congress outside the limits of any municipality. American experience shows (he thinks) that the ''maximum'' (price control) cannot be worked on a national, but only on municipal basis. Paine also insists on the need of staying the inflation of paper currency. But the greatest danger he signalizes is &quot;the spirit of denunciation that now prevails&quot;. {{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=350}}}}

The economic situation was deteriorating rapidly, adding to the general unrest. By the end of the winter, grain circulation had stopped completely and grain prices doubled. Despite [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]]'s advice, vast quantities of assignats were still being put in the circulation. In February 1793, they had fallen to 50 per cent of their face value. The depreciation provoked inflation and speculation. {{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=61}}

Military setbacks from the [[First Coalition]], [[Dumouriez]]'s treason and the war of [[War in the Vendée|Vendée]], which began in March 1793 aroused republican feeling and drove many republicans towards the ''[[The Mountain|montagnards]]''. The Girondins were forced to accept the creation of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and [[Revolutionary Tribunal]].{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=302}}

But authority was imperceptibly passing into hands of the 150 ''montagnards'' delegated to the ''départements'' and armed forces. The Gironde saw its influence decline in the interior and the number of anti-Brissot petitions increased by late March.{{sfn|Bouloiseau|1983|p=65}}

Faced with the combined threat from inside and outside France, the popular movement imposed the first measures of &quot;public safety&quot;. For while the perceived inability of the Gironde to fend off supposed dangers became evident, the ''montagnards'', in their determination to &quot;save the Revolution&quot;, were gradually adopting the political program proposed by the popular militants.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=303}}

== Toward the crisis ==

[[File:Lille PBA boilly triomphe de marat.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Le triomphe de Marat, [[Louis-Léopold Boilly]], 1794]]
On 5 April the [[Jacobin]]s, presided by [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], sent a circular letter to popular societies in the provinces inviting them to ask for the recall and dismissal of those ''appelants'', who had voted for the decision to execute the King to be referred back to the people. On 13 April [[Marguerite-Élie Guadet|Guadet]] proposed that Marat be charged for having, as president of the club, signed that circular, and this proposal was passed by the Convention by 226 votes to 93, with 47 abstentions, following an angry debate. Marat's case was passed to the Revolutionary Tribunal, where Marat offered himself as &quot;''the apostle and martyr of liberty''&quot;, and he was triumphantly acquitted on 24 April. Already on the 15, thirty-five of the forty-eight Paris sections had presented a petition to the Convention couched in the most threatening terms against the twenty-two most prominent Girondins.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=307}}

The Gironde turned its attack on the very citadel of Montagnard power, the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]]. In his reply to [[Camille Desmoulins]]'s ''Histoire des Brissotins'', which was read at Jacobins on 17 May, Guadet on the following day denounced the Paris authorities in the Convention, describing them as &quot;''authorities devoted to anarchy, and greedy for both money and political domination''&quot;: his proposal was that they be immediately quashed. A commission of inquiry of twelve members was at once set up, on which only Girondins sat. This Commission of Twelve ordered the arrest of [[Jacques Hébert|Hebert]] on 24 May for the anti-girondin article in number 239 of the ''Pere Duchesne''. Other popular militants were arrested, including [[Jean-François Varlet|Varlet]] and Dobsen, the president of the ''Cite'' section. These measures brought on the final crisis.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=309}}

On 25 May the Commune demanded that arrested patriots to be released. In reply, [[Maximin Isnard|Isnard]], who was presiding over the Convention, launched into a bitter diatribe against Paris which was infuriatingly reminiscent of the [[Brunswick Manifesto]]: &quot;''If any attack made on the persons of the representatives of the nation, then I declare to you in the name of the whole country that Paris would be destroyed; soon people would be searching along the banks of the Seine to find out whether Paris had ever existed''&quot;.

On the next day, at the Jacobin Club, [[Robespierre]] called on the people to revolt. The Jacobins declared themselves in a state of insurrection.

On 28 May the ''Cite'' section called the other sections to a meeting the following day at the ''Évêché'' (the Bishop's Palace) in order to organize the insurrection. Varlet and Dobsen had been freed from prison on the previous day on the orders of the Convention and were present at the meeting, which was attended only by the ''Montagne'' and by the members of the Plain. On the 29 the delegates representing thirty-three of the sections formed an insurrectionary committee of nine.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=309}}

Most of its members were comparatively young men and little known. [[Jean-François Varlet|Varlet]] had, indeed, made his name as an agitator; Hassenfratz held an important post in the War Office; Dobsen had been foremen of the jury in the Revolutionary Tribunal; Rousselin edited the ''Feuille du salut public''. But who had ever heard of the printer Marquet, who presided over the Central Committee, or of its secretary Tombe? Who had ever heard of the painter Simon of the ''Halle-au-Ble'' section, of the toy-maker Bonhommet, of Auvray, an usher from Montmartre, of Crepin the decorator, of Caillieaux the ribbon-maker, or of the ''declasse'' aristocrat Duroure? Yet these unknown men purported to be the voice of the people. They were all Frenchmen and they were all Parisians and not novices in revolution.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=353}}

On 30 May the department gave its support to the movement.

== Friday, 31 May ==
The insurrection started on 31 May and directed by the committee at the ''Évêché'' (the Bishop's Palace Committee), developed according to the methods already tested on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August]]. At six o'clock in the morning the delegates of the 33 sections, led by Dobsen, presented themselves at ''[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]'', showed the full powers with which the members had invested them, and suppressed the Commune, whose members had retired to the adjourning room. Next the revolutionary delegates provisionally reinstated the Commune in its functions.

The insurgent committee, which was now sitting at the ''Hôtel de Ville'', dictated to the Commune, now reinstated by the people, what measures it was to take. It obtained [[François Hanriot]], commandant of the battalion of the ''Jardin des Plantes'', to be nominated as sole commander-in-chief of the National Guard of Paris. It was decided that the poorer National Guards who were under arms should receive pay at the rate of 40 ''sous'' a day. The alarm-gun was fired towards noon. The assembly of the Parisian authorities, summoned by the departmental assembly, resolved to cooperate with the Commune and the insurrectionary committee, whose numbers were raised to 21 by the addition of delegates from the meeting at the Jacobins.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=323}} Hanriot's first care was to seize the key positions—[[Bassin de l'Arsenal|the Arsenal]], the ''[[Place des Vosges|Place Royale]]'', and the ''[[Pont Neuf]]''. Next the barriers were closed and prominent suspects arrested.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=354}}
 
The sections were very slow in getting under way. 31 May was a Friday, so the workers were at their jobs. The demonstration took shape only in the afternoon. The Convention assembled at the sound of the [[:wikt:tocsin|tocsin]] and of the drum beating to arms. Girondins protested against the closing of the city gates and against the tocsin and alarm-gun. Petitioners from the sections and the Commune appeared at the bar at about five o'clock in the afternoon. They demanded that 22 and commission of 12 should be cited before the Revolutionary Tribunal, that a central revolutionary army should be raised, that the price of bread should be fixed at three ''sous'' a pound, that nobles holding senior rank in the army should be dismissed, that armories should be created for arming the ''sans-culottes'', the departments of State purged, suspects arrested, the right to vote provisionally reserved to ''sans-culottes'' only, and a fund set apart for the relatives of those defending their country and for the relief of aged and infirm.

The petitioners made their way into the hall and sat down besides the Montagnards. [[Robespierre]] ascended the tribune and supported the suppression of the commissions. When [[Vergniaud]] called upon him to conclude, Robespierre turned towards him and said: &quot;Yes, I will conclude, but it will be against you! Against you, who, after the revolution [[10 August 1792|10 August]], wanted to send those responsible for it to the scaffold; against you, who have never ceased to incite to the destruction of Paris; against you, who wanted to save the tyrant; against you, who conspired with [[Dumouriez]]... Well my conclusion is: the prosecution of all Dumouriez's accomplices and all those whose names have been mentioned by the petitioners...&quot; To this Vergniaud did not reply. The Convention suppressed the commissions of twelve and approved the ordinance of the Commune granting two ''livres'' a day to workmen under arms.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=324}}

Yet the rising of 31 May ended unsatisfactorily. That evening at the Commune, [[Chaumette]] and Dobsen were accused by [[Jean-François Varlet|Varlet]] of weakness. Robespierre had declared from the tribune that the ''journee'' of 31 May was not enough. At the Jacobins [[Billaud-Varenne]] echoed: &quot;Our country is not saved; there were important measures of public safety that had to be taken; it was today that we had to strike the final blows against factionalism&quot;. The Commune declaring itself duped, demanded and prepared a &quot;supplement&quot; to the revolution.{{sfn|Aulard|1910|p=110}}

== End of the Gironde ==

[[File:The elimination of Girondins 2.png|thumb|right|280px|Arrestation des Girondins à la Convention Nationale le 2 Juin 1793]]

On 1 June the National Guard remained under arms. [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] himself repaired to the ''Hôtel de Ville'', and gave, with emphatic solemnity, a &quot;counsel&quot; to the people; namely, to remain afoot and not to quit until victory was theirs. He himself climbed to the belfry of the ''Hôtel de Ville'' and rang the tocsin. The Convention broke the session at six o'clock, at the time when the Commune was to present a new petition against the twenty-two. At the tocsin sound it assembled again and the petition demanding the arrest of the Girondins was referred to the Committee of Public Safety for examination and report within three days.{{sfn|Aulard|1910|p=110}}

During the night 1–2 June insurrectionary committee, by agreement with the Commune, ordered Hanriot to &quot;''surround the Convention with an armed force sufficient to command respect, in order that the chiefs of the faction may be arrested during the day, in case the Convention refused to accede to the request of the citizens of Paris''&quot;. Orders were given to suppress the Girondin newspapers and arrest their editors.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=325}}

2 June was a Sunday. Workmen thronged to obey [[François Hanriot|Hanriot]]'s orders, and soon eighty thousand armed men with cannons, surrounded the [[Tuileries]]. The session of the Convention opened with bad news: the chief town of the [[Vendee]], had just fallen into hands of rebels. At [[Lyons]] royalist and Girondin sections had gained control of the ''Hotel de Ville'' after a fierce struggle, in which it was said that eight hundred republicans had perished.

Despite that [[Lanjuinais]] denounced the revolt of the Paris Commune and asked for its suppression. &quot;I demand,&quot; said he, &quot;to speak respecting the general call to arms now beating throughout Paris.&quot; He was immediately interrupted by cries of &quot;Down! down! He wants civil war! He wants a counter-revolution! He calumniates Paris! He insults the people.&quot; Despite the threats, the insults, the clamours of the Mountain and the galleries, Lanjuinais denounced the projects of the commune and of the malcontents; his courage rose with the danger. &quot;You accuse us,&quot; he said, &quot;of calumniating Paris! Paris is pure; Paris is good; Paris is oppressed by tyrants who thirst for blood and dominion.&quot; These words were the signal for the most violent tumult; several Mountain deputies rushed to the tribune to tear Lanjuinais from it; but he, clinging firmly to it, exclaimed, in accents of the most lofty courage, &quot;I demand the dissolution of all the revolutionist authorities in Paris. I demand that all they have done during the last three days may be declared null. I demand that all who would arrogate to themselves a new authority contrary to law, be placed without the law, and that every citizen be at liberty to punish them.&quot; He had scarcely concluded, when the insurgent petitioners came to demand his arrest, and that of his colleagues. &quot;Citizens,&quot; said they, &quot;the people are weary of seeing their happiness still postponed; they leave it once more in your hands; save them, or we declare that they will save themselves.&quot; The demand again was referred to the [[Committee of Public Safety]].{{sfn|Mignet|1824|p=297}}

The petitioners went out shaking their fists at the Assembly and shouting: &quot;''To arms!''&quot;. Strict orders were given by Hanriot forbidding the National Guard to let any deputy go in or out. [[Barere|Barrère]] in the name of the Committee proposed a compromise. The twenty-two and the twelve were not to be arrested, but were called upon to voluntarily to suspend the exercise of their functions. [[Maximin Isnard|Isnard]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Fauchet]] obeyed on the spot. Others refused. While this was going on, [[Charles-François Delacroix|Lacroix]], a deputy of the Mountain, rushed into the house, and to the tribune, and declared that he had been insulted at the door, that he had been refused egress, and that the convention was no longer free. Many of the Mountain expressed their indignation at Henriot and his troops. [[Danton]] said it was necessary vigorously to avenge this insult to the national majesty. Barrère proposed to the convention to present themselves to the people. &quot;Representatives,&quot; said he, &quot;vindicate your liberty; suspend your sitting; cause the bayonets that surround you to be lowered.&quot; {{sfn|Mignet|1824|p=298}}

And at the prompting of Barrère the whole Convention, save left of the Montagne, started out, led by the president, [[Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles|Hérault de Séchelles]], and attempted to exit their way through the wall of steel with which they were surrounded. On arriving at a door on the [[Place du Carrousel]], they found there [[François Hanriot|Hanriot]] on horseback, sabre in hand. &quot;What do the people require?&quot; said the president, Hérault de Séchelles; &quot;the convention is wholly engaged in promoting their happiness.&quot; &quot;Hérault,&quot; replied Henriot, &quot;the people have not risen to hear phrases; they require twenty-four traitors to be given up to them.&quot;{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|Mignet quote is a mild version of the Henriot's reply. Historian [[David Bell (historian)|David Bell]] in his review «[https://jshare.johnshopkins.edu/myweb/davidbell/andress.pdf When Terror Was Young]» of David Andress' book «[http://www.amazon.com/The-Terror-Merciless-Freedom-Revolutionary/dp/0374530734 The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France]» gives harsher version of the same reply: ''&quot;Tell your fucking president that he and his Assembly are fucked, and that if within one hour he doesn’t deliver to me the Twenty-two I’m going to blast it to the ground&quot;''. In his view (David Bell's) ''&quot;such were the words, uttered by the sans-culotte commander Hanriot, cannon literally in hand, by which France’s fledgling democracy died&quot;'' and even the very language underlines it. For [[François Furet]] it was ''&quot;the confrontation between national representation and direct democracy personified in brute force of the poorer classes and their guns&quot;''. {{sfn|Furet|1996|p=127}}}} &quot;Give us all up!&quot; cried those who surrounded the president.

The Assembly walked round the palace, repulsed by bayonets on all sides, only to return and submit.{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=326}} On the motion of [[Couthon]] the Convention voted for the suspension and internment (''arrestation chex eux'') of twenty-nine Girondin members together with ministers [[Étienne Clavière|Claviere]] and [[Pierre Henri Hélène Marie Lebrun-Tondu|Lebrun]], but stipulated that they should be placed under arrest at their own homes under guard of a gendarme.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=354}}{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|Arrested Girondins:&lt;br /&gt;[[Charles Jean Marie Barbaroux|Barbaroux]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Aubin Bigorie du Chambon|fr|3=Aubin Bigorie du Chambon|lt=Chambon}}, [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Brissot]], [[François Buzot|Buzot]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Birotteau|fr|3=Jean Birotteau|lt=Birotteau}}, [[Armand Gensonné|Gensonné]], [[Antoine Joseph Gorsas|Gorsas]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Antoine Grangeneuve|fr|3=Jean-Antoine Grangeneuve|lt=Grangeneuve}}, [[Marguerite-Élie Guadet|Guadet]], [[Jean Denis, comte Lanjuinais|Lanjuinais]], [[Marc David Alba Lasource|Lasource]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Lehardy|fr|3=Pierre Lehardy|lt=Lehardy}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Denis Toussaint Lesage|fr|3=Denis Toussaint Lesage|lt=Lesage}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernard-François Lidon|fr|3=Bernard-François Lidon|lt=Lidon}}, [[Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvrai|Louvet]], [[Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve|Pétion]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Baptiste Salle|fr|3=Jean-Baptiste Salle|lt=Salle}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Éléonor Dufriche-Valazé|fr|3=Charles Éléonor Dufriche-Valazé|lt=Valazé}}, [[Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud|Vergniaud]], {{Interlanguage link multi|François Bergoeing|fr|3=François Bergoeing|lt=Bergoeing}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Boilleau|fr|3=Jacques Boilleau|lt=Boilleau}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-François Martin Gardien|fr|3=Jean-François Martin Gardien|lt=Gardien}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-René Gomaire|fr|3=Jean-René Gomaire|lt=Gomaire}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Augustin Bernard François Le Goazre de Kervélégan|fr|3=Augustin Bernard François Le Goazre de Kervélégan|lt=Kervélégan}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Ambroise Bertrand de La Hosdinière|fr|3=Charles Ambroise Bertrand de La Hosdinière|lt=La Hosdinière}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Henry-Larivière|fr|3=Pierre Henry-Larivière|lt=Henry-Larivière}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Étienne Mollevaut|fr|3=Étienne Mollevaut|lt=Mollevaut}}, [[Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne|Rabaut]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Louis-François-Sébastien Viger|fr|3=Louis-François-Sébastien Viger|lt=Viger}}}}

== Aftermath ==

Thus the struggle which had begun in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] ended in the triumph of the Mountain. The Gironde ceased to be a political force. It had declared war without knowing how to conduct it; it had denounced the King but had shrunk from condemning him; it had contributed to the worsening of the economic crisis but had swept aside all the claims made by the popular movement.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=311}}

The 31 May soon came to be regarded as one of the great ''journees'' of the Revolution. It shared with [[Storming of the Bastille|14 July 1789]] and 10 August 1792 the honor of having a ship of the line named after it. But the results of the crisis left all the participants dissatisfied. [[Danton]]'s hopes of last-minute compromise had been shattered. Although the Montagnards had succeeded in averting bloodshed the outrage to the Assembly might well set the provinces on fire. But the Montagnards now had a chance to govern the country and to infuse new energy into national defense.{{sfn|Hampson|1988|p=180}}

Though for the popular movement most of the demands presented to the Convention were not achieved, the insurrection 31 May – 2 June 1793 inaugurated new phase in the Revolution. In the course of summer 1793 Revolutionary government was created, ''maximum'' and price controls were introduced and Jacobin republic began its offensive against the enemies of the Revolution.

On Parisian house-fronts could now be seen the inscription, suggested by a resolution of the department on 29 June, ''Unité, Indivisibilité de la République; Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité ou la mort'', surmounted by tricolor pendants, and caps of liberty. Twice within a year Paris saved France. For the second time it demanded as its reward the government of the people by the people.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=356}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36772">The [[French Revolution]] obviously had a major impact on Europe and the New World. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in [[human history]].&lt;ref&gt;Linda S. Frey and Marsha L. Frey, ''The French Revolution'' (2004), Foreword.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton, ''A History of the Modern World'' (5th ed. 1978), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferenc Fehér, ''The French Revolution and the Birth of Modernity'', (1990) pp. 117-30&lt;/ref&gt; In the short-term, France lost thousands of her countrymen in the form of [[émigrés]], or emigrants who wished to escape political tensions and save their lives.   A number of individuals settled in the neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), however quite a few also went to the United States.  The displacement of these Frenchmen led to a spread of French culture, policies regulating immigration, and a safe haven for Royalists and other counterrevolutionaries to outlast the violence of the French Revolution.  The long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarizing politics for more than a century.  The closer other countries were, the greater and deeper was the French impact, bringing liberalism and the end of many feudal or traditional laws and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Rapport and Peter McPhee. &quot;The International Repercussions of the French Revolution&quot;, in ''A Companion to the French Revolution'' (2013), pp 379–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klaits|first1=Joseph|last2=Haltzel|first2=Michael H.|last3=Haltzel|first3=Michael|title=Global Ramifications of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVilfUkW5usC|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there was also a conservative counter-reaction that defeated Napoleon, reinstalled the Bourbon kings, and in some ways reversed the new reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artz&quot;&gt;Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction &amp; Revolution: 1814–1832'' (Rise of Modern Europe) (1934), pp. 142–43&lt;!--publishing info needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the new nations created by the French were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Frederick Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution: 
:For nearly two decades the Italians had the excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artz&quot;/&gt;

Likewise in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin: 
:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp 187–88, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789–1799'' (1934), p. 235.&lt;!--publisher needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest impact came of course in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized—new names were given, &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Impact on France==
{{main article|French Revolution#France}}
The changes in France were enormous; some were widely accepted and others were bitterly contested into the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;John Hall Stewart, ''A Documentary Survey of the french revolution'' (1951) pp 783–94&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the Revolution, the people had little power or voice. The kings had so thoroughly centralized the system that most nobles spent their time at Versailles, and played only a small direct role in their home districts. Thompson says that the kings had:
:ruled by virtue of their personal wealth, their patronage of the nobility, their disposal of ecclesiastical offices, their provincial governors (''intendants''), their control over the judges and magistrates, and their command of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Thompson, ''Robespierre and the French Revolution'' (1962), p. 22&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first year of revolution, this power had been stripped away. The king was a figurehead, the nobility had lost all their titles and most of their land, the Church lost its monasteries and farmlands, bishops, judges and magistrates were elected by the people, the army was almost helpless, with military power in the hands of the new revolutionary National Guard. The central elements of 1789 were the slogan &quot;''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]''&quot; and the &quot;[[The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]&quot;, which Lefebvre calls &quot;the incarnation of the Revolution as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Georges Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&amp;pg=PA212|origyear=1947|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarizing politics for more than a century. [[François Victor Alphonse Aulard|Historian François Aulard]] writes:
:From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life.... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Aulard in Arthur Tilley, ed.|title= Modern France. A Companion to French Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c45AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=1922|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on Europe==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
Europe was wracked by two decades of war revolving around France's efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of reactionary royalty, led by Britain and Austria.  War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (1792).

===French emigration===
{{Main article|French emigration (1789–1815)}}To escape political tensions and save their lives, a number of individuals, mostly men, emigrated from France. Many settled in neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), and quite a few went to the United States.  The presence of these thousands of Frenchmen of varying socioeconomic backgrounds who had just fled a hotbed of revolutionary activity posed a problem for the nations that extended refuge to the migrants.  The fear was that they brought with them a plot to disrupt the political order, which did lead to increased regulation and documentation of the influx of immigrants in neighboring countries.  Still, most nations such as Britain remained magnanimous and welcomed the French.

===French conquests===
In foreign affairs, the French Army at first was quite successful.  It conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France.  It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states.  The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia the Ottoman Empire, and Austria).  It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and The French Army trapped in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989), pp 341–68&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History, 1789–1815: France Against Europe'' (1969)&lt;!--publisher, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon conquered most of Italy in the name of the French Revolution in 1797–99. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centered on Milan. Genoa the city became a republic while its hinterland became the [[Ligurian Republic]]. The [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] was formed out of the papal holdings while the pope himself was sent to France. The [[Neapolitan Republic (1799)|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months before the enemy forces of the Coalition recaptured it.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In 1805 he formed the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], with himself as king and his stepson as viceroy. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries where satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp 62–65, 78–79, 88–96, 115–17, 154–59&lt;!--publisher, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' 2:293–326, 365–94&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution: 
:For nearly two decades the Italians had the excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artz&quot;/&gt;

===Nationalism===
Otto Dann and John Dinwiddy report, &quot;It has long been almost a truism of European history that the French Revolution gave a great 
stimulus to the growth of modern nationalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dann|first1=Otto|last2=Dinwiddy|first2=John|title=Nationalism in the Age of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrujM36H7qUC&amp;pg=PP13|year=1988|publisher=Continuum|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationalism was emphasized by historian [[Carlton J.H. Hayes]] as a major result of the French Revolution across Europe. The impact on French nationalism was profound. Napoleon became such a heroic symbol of the nation that the glory was easily picked up by his nephew, who was overwhelmingly elected president (and later became Emperor Napoleon III).&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Fry Hyslop, ''French Nationalism in 1789'' (1968) especially chap. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The influence was great in the hundreds of small German states and elsewhere, where it was  either inspired by the French example or in reaction against it.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton J. H. Hayes, ''The Historical Evolution of Modern Nationalism'' (1931), ch 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keitner|first=Chimene I.|title=The Paradoxes of Nationalism: The French Revolution and Its Meaning for Contemporary Nation Building|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MYLwpOJMnUC|year=2007|publisher=SUNY Press|page=12}}&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Britain saw minority support, but the majority, and especially the elite, strongly opposed the French Revolution. Britain led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815, and then restored the Bourbons.  [[Edmund Burke]] was the chief spokesman for the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Vincent Macleod, ''A War of Ideas: British Attitudes to the War against Revolutionary France, 1792–1802'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: The Struggle, Volume II'' (1970), pp 459–505.&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the effect was to transform what had been an attempt by Protestant settlers to gain some autonomy into a mass movement led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]] involving Catholics and Protestants. It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland, especially in Ulster. The upshot was a revolt in 1798, led by [[Wolfe Tone]], that was crushed by Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Pelling|title=Anglo-Irish Relations: 1798 1922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttSsGEWW3tcC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' 2: 491–508.&lt;/ref&gt; This revolt is seen as the foundation for modern Irish republicanism, which eventually led to the partition of Ireland and independence for 26 of its 32 counties.

===Germany===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
{{main article|History of Germany#French Revolution 1789–1815}}
German reaction to the Revolution swung from favorable at first to antagonistic. At first it brought liberal and democratic ideas, the end of guilds, of serfdom and of the Jewish ghetto. It brought economic freedoms and agrarian and legal reform. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and  The Enlightenment.  There were enemies as well, as the royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced the overthrow of the king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

By 1793, the [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution of the French king]] and the onset of [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]] disillusioned the &quot;Bildungsbürgertum&quot; (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sheehan, ''German History, 1770–1866'' (1993), pp. 207–322.&lt;!--publisher, page(s); ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' 2:425-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanning Blanning, &quot;The French Revolution and the Modernization of Germany&quot;, in ''Central European History'' (1989) 22#2, pp 109–29.&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rheinbund 1812, political map.png|thumb|300px|The [[Confederation of the Rhine]], composed of client states under Napoleon's control, 1806 to 1813; most German states belonged except Prussia (in the northeast) and Austria (in the southeast). The map text is in German]]
After Prussia was humiliated by Napoleon opinion swung against France and stimulated and shaped German nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodore S.

France took direct control of the Rhineland 1794–1814 and radically and permanently liberalized the government, society and economy.&lt;ref&gt;T. C. W. Blanning, ''The French Revolution in Germany: Occupation and Resistance in the Rhineland 1792–1802'' (1983)&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. The most important impact came from the abolition of all feudal privileges and historic taxes, the introduction of legal reforms of the Napoleonic Code, and the reorganization of the judicial and local administrative systems. The economic integration of the Rhineland with France increased prosperity, especially in industrial production, while business accelerated with the new efficiency and lowered trade barriers. The Jews were liberated from the ghetto. One sour point was the hostility of the French officials toward the Roman Catholic Church, the choice of most of the residents. Much of South Germany felt a similar but more muted influence of the French Revolution, while in Prussia and areas to the east there was far less impact.&lt;ref&gt;Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany, 1648–1840 (1964), pp 386–87.&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms were permanent. Decades later workers and peasants in the Rhineland often appealed to Jacobinism to oppose unpopular government programs, while the intelligentsia demanded the maintenance of the Napoleonic Code (which was stayed in effect for a century).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rowe, ''From Reich to state: the Rhineland in the revolutionary age, 1780–1830'' (2003)&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{main article|Helvetic Republic}}
The French invaded Switzerland and turned it into an ally known as the &quot;[[Helvetic Republic]]&quot; (1798–1803). The interference with localism and traditional liberties was deeply resented, although some modernizing reforms took place.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Marc H.  Lerner, &quot;The Helvetic Republic: An Ambivalent Reception of French Revolutionary Liberty&quot;, ''French History'' (2004) 18#1, pp 50–75.&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' 2: 394–421&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance was strongest in the more traditional Catholic bastions, with armed uprisings breaking out in spring 1798 in the central part of Switzerland. Alois Von Reding, a powerful Swiss general, led an army of 10,000 men from the Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden against the French. This resulted in the Swiss regaining control of Lucerne, however due to the sheer greatness in size of the French army, Von Reding's movement was eventually suppressed. The French Army suppressed the uprisings but support for revolutionary ideals steadily declined, as the Swiss resented their loss of local democracy, the new taxes, the centralization, and the hostility to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Dann and John Dinwiddy|title=Nationalism in the Age of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrujM36H7qUC&amp;pg=PA194|year=1988|publisher=Continuum|pages=190–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instability of France resulted in the creation of two different revolutionary groups with different ideologies of revolt: The aristocrats, seeking the restoration of the Old Swiss Confederacy and a section of the population wanting a coup. Furthermore, Switzerland became a battleground between the armies of France, Austria and Russia. Ultimately, this instability, frequent coups within the government and the eventual Bourla-papey forced Napoleon to sign the Act of Medallion which led to the fall of the Helvetic Republic and the restoration of the Confederacy.

The long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin: 
:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp 187–88, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789–1799'' (1934), p. 235.&lt;!-- publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
{{main article|Belgium in the long nineteenth century#French rule}}
French invaded the territory of modern-day Belgium and controlled it between 1794–1814. The French imposed reforms and incorporated the territory into France. New rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Nearly everyone was Catholic, but the Church was repressed. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had a government bureaucracy selected by merit.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries: 1780–1940'' (1978) pp 65–81, 101–02.&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antwerp]] regained access to the sea and grew quickly as a major port and business center. France promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining.  In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs  flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard A. Cook, ''Belgium'' (2005) pp 49–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Clark, &quot;Nobility, Bourgeoisie and the Industrial Revolution in Belgium,&quot;  ''Past &amp; Present'' (1984) # 105 pp. 140–175; [http://www.jstor.org/stable/650548 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{main article|Batavian Republic}}
France turned the Netherlands into a puppet state that had to pay large indemnities.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' 2: 394–421&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark and Sweden===
{{main article|History of Denmark#Reforms}}
The Kingdom of Denmark adopted liberalizing reforms in line with those of the French Revolution, with no direct contact. Danes were aware of French ideas and agreed with them, as it moved from Danish absolutism to a liberal constitutional system between 1750–1850. The change of government in 1784 was caused by a power vacuum created when King Christian VII took ill, and power shifted to the crown prince (who later became King Frederik VI) and reform-oriented landowners. In contrast to Old Regime France, agricultural reform was intensified in Denmark, serfdom was abolished and civil rights were extended to the peasants, the finances of the Danish state were healthy, and there were no external or internal crises.  That is, reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organized liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Horstboll, and Uffe Ostergård, &quot;Reform and Revolution: The French Revolution and the Case of Denmark,&quot; ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (1990) 15#3 pp 155–79&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.

In Sweden, King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (reigned 1771–92) was an enlightened despot, who  weakened the nobility and  promoted numerous major social reforms.  He felt the Swedish monarchy could survive and flourish by achieving a coalition with the newly emerged middle classes against the nobility.  He was close to King Louis XVI so he was disgusted with French radicalism. Nevertheless, he decided to promote additional antifeudal reforms  to strengthen his hand among the middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;Munro Price, &quot;Louis XVI and Gustavus III: Secret Diplomacy and Counter-Revolution, 1791–1792,&quot; ''Historical Journal'' (1999) 42#2 pp.  435–466 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3020995 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the king was assassinated in 1792 his brother [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles]] became regent, but real power was with [[Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm]], who bitterly opposed the French Revolution and all its supporters. Under [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|King Gustav IV Adolf]], Sweden joined various coalitions against Napoleon, but was badly defeated and lost much of its territory, especially Finland and Pomerania.  The king was overthrown by the army, which in 1810 decided to bring in one of Napoleon's marshals, [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]], as the heir apparent and army commander.  He had a Jacobin background and was well-grounded in revolutionary principles, but put Sweden in the coalition that opposed Napoleon. Bernadotte served as a quite conservative king Charles XIV John of Sweden (1818–44).&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bernadotte: Napoleon's Marshal, Sweden's King'' (1991)&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==World impact==

===United States===
The French Revolution won widespread American support in its early phase, but when the king was executed it polarized American opinion and played a major role in shaping American politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Downer Hazen|title=Contemporary American Opinion of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1s0z2bOEUFwC|year=1897|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP}}&lt;/ref&gt; President George Washington declared neutrality in the European wars, but the polarization shaped the [[First Party System]]. In 1793, the first [[Democratic-Republican Societies|&quot;Democratic societies&quot;]] were formed. They supported the French Revolution in the wake of the execution of the king. The word &quot;democrat&quot; was proposed by French Ambassador [[Citizen Genet]] for the societies, which he was secretly subsidizing. The emerging [[Federalist party|Federalists]] led by [[Alexander Hamilton]] began to ridicule the supporters of [[Thomas Jefferson]] as &quot;democrats&quot;. Genet now began mobilizing American voters using French money, for which he was expelled by President Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Genet would have been executed if he returned to Paris; he stayed in New York, became an American citizen, and married the daughter of the governor of New York. Eugene R. Sheridan, &quot;The Recall of Edmond Charles Genet: A Study in Transatlantic Politics and Diplomacy&quot;, ''Diplomatic History'' (1994) 18#4 pp: 463–88.&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After President Washington denounced the societies as unrepublican, they faded away. In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republican Party]] favored France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. Washington and his unanimous cabinet (including Jefferson) decided the treaty did not bind the U.S. to enter the war; instead Washington proclaimed neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Under President Adams, a Federalist, an undeclared naval war took place with France in 1798–99, called the &quot;[[Quasi War]]&quot;. Jefferson became president in 1801, but was hostile to Napoleon as a dictator and emperor. Nevertheless, he did seize the opportunity to [[Louisiana Purchase|purchase Louisiana in 1803]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. Kaplan, &quot;Jefferson, the Napoleonic Wars, and the Balance of Power&quot;, ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1957) 14#2 pp. 196–217 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1922110 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad similarities but different experiences between the French and American revolutions lead to a certain kinship between France and the United States, with both countries seeing themselves as pioneers of liberty and promoting republican ideals. &lt;ref name=&quot;am &amp; fre similarities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Similarities Between the American and French Revolutions : Western Civilization II Guides|url=http://westerncivguides.umwblogs.org/2012/04/16/similarities-between-the-american-and-french-revolutions/|website=Western Civilization II Guides|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bond manifesting itself in such exchanges as the gift of the [[Statue of Liberty]] by France. &lt;ref name=&quot;Statue of liberty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The French Connection - Statue Of Liberty National Monument (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/stli/learn/historyculture/the-french-connection.htm|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=28 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haiti and Latin America===
The call for modification of society was influenced by the revolution in France, and once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of the Haitian people, there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;scholar.library.miami.edu&quot;&gt;Rand, David. &quot;The Haitian Revolution.&quot; The Haitian Revolution. Accessed March 25, 2015. http://scholar.library.miami.edu/slaves/san_domingo_revolution/ individual_essay/david.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;scholar.library.miami.edu&quot;/&gt; Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghachem, Malick W 2012&quot;&gt;Ghachem, Malick W. The Old Regime and the Haitian Revolution.

September 1, 2012. Accessed March 25, 2015. http://haitianrevolutionfblock.weebly.com/causes-of-the-haitian-revolution.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.&lt;ref&gt;Baur, John. &quot;International Repercussions of the Haitian Revolution.&quot; The Americas 26, no. 4 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1810, the term &quot;liberal&quot; was coined in Spanish politics to indicate supporters of the French Revolution. This usage passed to Latin America and animated the independence movement against Spain. In the nineteenth century &quot;Liberalism&quot; was the dominant element in Latin American political thought. French liberal ideas were especially influential in Mexico, particularly as seen through the writings of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]]. The Latin American political culture oscillated between two opposite poles: the ''traditional'', as based on highly specific personal and family ties to kin groups, communities, and religious identity; and the ''modern'', based on impersonal ideals of individualism, equality, legal rights, and secularism or anti-clericalism. The French Revolutionary model was the basis for the modern viewpoint, as explicated in Mexico in the writings of [[José María Luis Mora]] (1794–1850).

In Mexico, modern liberalism was best expressed in the [[Liberal Party (Mexico)|Liberal Party]], the [[Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857|Constitution of 1857]], the policies of [[Benito Juárez]], and finally by [[Francisco I. Madero]]'s democratic movement leading to the Revolution of 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Hale, &quot;The revival of political history and the French Revolution in Mexico&quot;, in Joseph Klaits and Michael Haltzel, eds. ''Global Ramifications of the French Revolution'' (2002), pp 158–76.&lt;!--publisher, pages, ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
The impact of the French Revolution on the Middle East came in terms of the political and military impact of Napoleon's invasion; and in the eventual influence of revolutionary and liberal ideas and revolutionary movements or rebellions. In terms of Napoleon's invasion in 1798, the response by Ottoman officials was highly negative. They warned that traditional religion would be overthrown. Long-standing Ottoman friendship with France ended. Sultan [[Selim III]] immediately realized how far behind his empire was, and started to modernize both his army and his governmental system. In Egypt itself, the ruling elite of [[Mamluk#Egypt|Mamluks]] was permanently displaced, speeding the reforms.  In intellectual terms, the immediate impact of the French Revolutionary ideas was nearly invisible, but there was a long-range influence on liberal ideas and the ideal of legal equality, as well as the notion of opposition to a tyrannical government. In this regard, the French Revolution brought such influential themes as constitutionalism, parliamentarianism, individual liberty, legal equality, and the sense of ethnic nationalism.  These came to fruition about 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Nikki R. Keddied, &quot;The French Revolution in the Middle East&quot;, in Joseph Klaits and Michael Haltzel, eds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20556">'''Symbolism in the French Revolution''' was a device to distinguish and celebrate (or vilify) the main features of the [[French Revolution]] and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instill in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Censer and Hunt, &quot;How to Read Images&quot; CD-ROM with {{Cite book|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution|year=2001|location = Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|first =Jack|last = Censer|author2=Lynn Hunt }}

[[File:Sansculottes.jpg|thumb|French revolutionaries wearing [[Phrygian cap]]s and ''tricolor'' [[cockade]]s]]

==Fasces==

[[Fasces#Fasces in France|Fasces]], like many other symbols of the French Revolution, are Roman in origin. Fasces are a bundle of birch rods containing an axe. In Roman times, the fasces symbolized the power of magistrates, representing union and accord with the Roman Republic.  The French Republic continued this Roman symbol to represent state power, justice, and unity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Censer and Hunt, &quot;How to Read Images&quot; CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Armoiries république française.svg|thumb|left|The unofficial but common [[National Emblem of France]] is backed by a fasces, representing justice.]]

During the Revolution, the fasces image was often used in conjunction with many other symbols. Though seen throughout the French Revolution, perhaps the most well known French reincarnation of the fasces is the Fasces surmounted by a Phrygian cap. This image has no display of an axe or a strong central state; rather, it symbolizes the power of the liberated people by placing the Liberty Cap on top of the classical symbol of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Tricolore cockade==

{{main|tricolore cockade}}
Cockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789. They now pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the ''Ancien Régime'' - thus producing the original [[tricolore cockade|''Tricolore'' cockade]]. Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction—although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent, and varied somewhat by region and period.
[[File:The french tricolor cockade.svg|thumb|left|250px|The tricolour cockade, created in July 1789. White (the royal color) was added to nationalise an earlier blue and red design.]]

The tricolour flag is derived from the cockades used in the 1790s. These were circular rosette-like emblems attached to the hat. [[Camille Desmoulins]] asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms. Cockades with various colour schemes were used during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowdy&quot;&gt;Crowdy, Terry, ''French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802'', p. 42 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The blue and red cockade was presented to King [[Louis XVI]] at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] on 17 July.  Lafayette argued for the addition of a white stripe to &quot;nationalise&quot; the design.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert Du Motier Lafayette (marquis de), ''Memoirs, correspondence and manuscripts of General Lafayette,'' vol. 2, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July, a tricolour cockade was adopted as part of the uniform of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], the national police force that succeeded the militia.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Dale, &quot;Can the Uniform Make the Citizen? Paris, 1789-1791,&quot; ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', 2001, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, a militant group on the far left, demanded a law in 1793 that would compel all women to wear the tricolor cockade to demonstrate their loyalty to the Republic.  The law was passed but was violently opposed by other groups of women. The Jacobins in charge of the government decided that women had no place in public affairs, and disbanded all women's organizations in October 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Darline Gay Levy, Harriet Branson Applewhite and Mary Durham Johnson, eds.  ''Women in Revolutionary Paris, 1789-1795''  (1981) pp 143-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberty cap==

In revolutionary France, the cap or ''[[:fr:bonnet rouge|bonnet rouge]]'' was first seen publicly in May 1790, at a festival in [[Troyes]] adorning a statue representing the nation, and at [[Lyon]], on a lance carried by the goddess [[Libertas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Harris, &quot;The Red Cap of Liberty: A Study of Dress Worn by French Revolutionary Partisans 1789-94.&quot; ''Eighteenth Century Studies'' (1981): 283-312. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2738492 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  To this day the [[national emblem]] of France, [[Marianne]], is shown wearing a Phrygian cap.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrigley, &quot;Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the french Revolution, ''French History''  '''11'''(2) 1997:131-169.&lt;/ref&gt; The caps were often knitted by women known as [[Tricoteuse]] who sat beside the guillotine during public executions in Paris in the French Revolution, supposedly continuing to knit in between executions.

[[File:Sans-culotte.jpg|thumb|250px||Early depiction of the tricolour in the hands of a ''[[sans-culotte]]'' during the French Revolution.]]
The Liberty cap, also known as the [[Phrygian cap]], or [[Pileus (hat)|pileus]], is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. The cap was originally worn by ancient Romans and Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460407/pileus entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The cap implies ennobling effects, as seen in its association with Homer's [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the mythical twins, [[Castor and Pollux]]. The emblem's popularity during the French Revolution is due in part to its importance in ancient Rome: its use alludes to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty. The Roman tribune [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] incited the slaves to insurrection by displaying a pileus as if it were a standard.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Cooper, and John McCardell. &quot;Liberty caps and liberty trees.&quot; ''Past and Present'' 146.1 (1995): 66-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pileus cap is often red in color. This type of cap was worn by revolutionaries at the fall of the Bastille. According to the Revolutions de Paris, it became &quot;the symbol of the liberation from all servitudes, the sign for unification of all the enemies of despotism.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Censer and Hunt, &quot;How to Read Images&quot; LEF CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt; The pileus competed with the Phrygian cap, a similar cap that covered the ears and the nape of the neck, for popularity. The Phrygian cap eventually supplanted the pileus and usurped its symbolism, becoming synonymous with republican liberty.

==Clothing==
{{main|1775–95 in Western fashion|1795–1820 in Western fashion}}
As the radicals and Jacobins became more powerful, there was a revulsion against high-fashion because of its extravagance and its association with royalty and aristocracy.  It was replaced with a sort of &quot;anti-fashion&quot; for men and women that emphasized simplicity and modesty.  The men wore plain, dark clothing and short unpowdered hair. During the Terror of 1794, the workaday outfits of the sans-culottes symbolized Jacobin egalitarianism. High fashion and extravagance returned under the Directory, 1795–99, with its [[Directoire style|&quot;directoire&quot; styles]]; the men did not return to extravagant customs.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Leith, &quot;Fashion and Anti-Fashion in the French Revolution,&quot; ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750-1850: Selected Papers'' (1998) pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberty Tree==

The Liberty Tree, officially adopted in 1792, is a symbol of the everlasting Republic, national freedom, and political revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; It has historic roots in revolutionary France as well as America, as a symbol that was shared by the two nascent republics.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and McCardell. &quot;Liberty caps and liberty trees.&quot;  (1995): 75–77&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was chosen as a symbol of the French Revolution because it symbolizes fertility in French folklore,&lt;ref&gt;Ozouf, &quot;Festivals and the French Revolution&quot; 123&lt;/ref&gt; which provided a simple transition from revering it for one reason to another. The American colonies also used the idea of a Liberty Tree to celebrate their own acts of insurrection against the British, starting with the Stamp Act riot in 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and McCardell. &quot;Liberty caps and liberty trees.&quot;  (1995): 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The riot culminated in the hanging in effigy of two Stamp Act politicians on a large elm tree. The elm tree began to be celebrated as a symbol of Liberty in the American colonies.&lt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and McCardell. &quot;Liberty caps and liberty trees.&quot;  (1995): 88&lt;/ref&gt;   It was adopted as a symbol that needed to be living and growing, along with the Republic. To that end, the tree is portrayed as a sapling, usually of an oak tree in French interpretation. The Liberty Tree serves as a constant celebration of the spirit of political freedom.

==Hercules==

The symbol of [[Hercules]] was first adopted by the [[Old Regime]] to represent the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1984, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hercules was an ancient Greek hero who symbolized strength and power. The symbol was used to represent the sovereign authority of the King over France during the reign of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon monarchs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt 1984, 101–102&quot;&gt;Hunt 1984, 101–102&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the monarchy was not the only ruling power in French history to use the symbol of Hercules to declare its power.

During the Revolution, the symbol of Hercules was revived to represent nascent revolutionary ideals. The first use of Hercules as a revolutionary symbol was during a festival celebrating the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly's]] victory over federalism on 10 August 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1984, 96&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Federalism&quot; was a movement to weaken the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Edmonds, &quot;'Federalism' and Urban Revolt in France in 1793,&quot; ''Journal of Modern History'' (1983) 55#1 pp 22-53&lt;/ref&gt; This Festival of Unity consisted of four stations around Paris which featured symbols representing major events of the Revolution which embodied revolutionary ideals of liberty, unity, and power.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1984, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of Hercules, placed at the station commemorating the fall of [[Louis XVI]], symbolized the power of the French people over their former oppressors. The statue's foot was placed on the throat of the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], which represented the tyranny of federalism which the new [[French First Republic|Republic]] had vanquished. In one hand, the statue grasped a club, a symbol of power, while in the other grasping the fasces which symbolized the unity of the French people.  The image of Hercules assisted the new Republic in establishing its new Republican moral system. Hercules thus evolved from a symbol of the sovereignty of the monarch into a symbol of the new sovereign authority in France: the French people.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1984, 97, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

This transition was made easily for two reasons. First, because Hercules was a famous mythological figure, and had previously been used by the monarchy, he was easily recognized by educated French observers.   It was not necessary for the revolutionary government to educate the French people on the background of the symbol. Additionally, Hercules recalled the classical age of the Greeks and the Romans, a period which the revolutionaries identified with [[Republicanism|republican]] and democratic ideals. These connotations made Hercules an easy choice to represent the powerful new sovereign people of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt 1984, 101–102&quot;/&gt; '''Louis XIV'''

During the more [[Reign of Terror|radical phase]] of the Revolution from 1793 to 1794, the usage and depiction of Hercules changed. These changes to the symbol were due to revolutionary leaders believing the symbol was inciting violence among the common citizens.  The triumphant battles of Hercules and the overcoming of enemies of the Republic became less prominent. In discussions over what symbol to use for the Seal of the Republic, the image of Hercules was considered but eventually ruled out in favor of [[Marianne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt 1984, 113&quot;&gt;Hunt 1984, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Hercules was on the coin of the Republic. However, this Hercules was not the same image as that of the pre-Terror phases of the Revolution. The new image of Hercules was more domesticated. He appeared more paternal, older, and wiser, rather than the warrior-like images in the early stages of the French Revolution. Unlike his 24-foot statue in the Festival of the Supreme Being, he was now the same size as Liberty and Equality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt 1984, 113&quot;/&gt;

Also the language on the coin with Hercules was very different from the rhetoric of pre-revolutionary depictions. On the coins the words, &quot;uniting Liberty and Equality&quot; were used. This is opposed to the forceful language of early Revolutionary rhetoric and rhetoric of the Bourbon monarchy. By 1798, the [[Council of Ancients]] had discussed the &quot;inevitable&quot; change from the problematic image of Hercules, and Hercules was eventually phased out in favor of an even more docile image.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt 1984, 113&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Pils - Rouget de Lisle chantant la Marseillaise.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Rouget de Lisle, composer of the Marseillaise, sings it for the first time in 1792]]

&quot;La Marseillaise&quot; ({{IPA-fr|la maʁsɛjɛz}}) became the [[national anthem]] of France.  The song was written and composed in 1792 by [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]], and was originally titled &quot;''Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin''&quot;. The [[French National Convention]] adopted it as the [[French First Republic|First Republic's]] anthem in 1795. It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by [[Fédéré|volunteers]] from [[Marseille]] marching on the capital.

The song is the first example of the &quot;European march&quot; anthemic style. The anthem's evocative melody and lyrics have led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and its incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music. Cerulo says, &quot;the design of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is credited to General Strasburg of France, who is said
to have directed de Lisle, the composer of the anthem, to 'produce one of those hymns which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. Cerulo, &quot;Symbols and the world system: national anthems and flags.&quot; ''Sociological Forum'' (1993) 8#2 pp. 243-271.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guillotine==
{{main|Guillotine}}
[[File:Cruikshank - The Radical's Arms.png|thumb|right|As shown in this British cartoon by [[Isaac Cruikshank]], the guillotine became a disparaging symbol of violent excess during the Reign of Terror. The tricolor ribbon on top is inscribed &quot;No God! No Religion! No King! No Constitution!&quot; Below the ribbon, and its Phrygian cap with tricolor cockade, are two bloody axes, attached to a guillotine, whose blade is suspended above a world aflame. An emaciated man and drunken woman dressed in ragged clothes serve as heraldic &quot;supporters&quot;, gleefully dancing on discarded royal and clerical regalia.]]
Hanson notes, &quot;The guillotine stands as the principal symbol of the Terror in the French Revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R. Hanson|title=The A to Z of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYJ4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker, more efficient and more distinctive form of execution, the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory. It was celebrated on the left as the people's avenger and cursed as the symbol of the [[Reign of Terror]] by the right.&lt;ref&gt;R. Po-chia Hsia, Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie G. Smith, ''The Making of the West, Peoples and Culture, A Concise History, Volume II: Since 1340'', (2nd ed., 2007), p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its operation became a popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators. Vendors sold programs listing the names of those scheduled to die. Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women ([[tricoteuse]]s) formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd. Parents often brought their children. By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically. Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Opie, ''Guillotine'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

What it is that horrifies people changes over time. Doyle comments:
:Even the unique horror of the guillotine has been dwarfed by the gas chambers of the Holocaust, the organized brutality of the gulag, the mass intimidation of Mao's cultural revolution, or the killing fields of Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Doyle|title=The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEi4bYIUP1sC&amp;pg=PT22|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commissioners of the Committee of Public Safety''' were appointed by the French [[Committee of Public Safety]] to oversee the various administrative departments between 1 April 1794 and 1 November 1795.

==History==

On 12 Germinal year II (1 April 1794) [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed to suppress the executive council and the six ministers, replacing the ministers with twelve committees reporting to the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. The proposal was unanimously adopted by the [[National Convention]].{{sfn|Muel|1891|p=41-42}}

The commissioners were dismissed when a new set of ministers was named by the [[French Directory]] on 3 November 1795.{{sfn|Muel|1891|p=46}}

==Committees==

Twelve committees were appointed, each composed of two members and one assistant, reporting to the Committee of Public Safety. 
The commissions were:{{sfn|Muel|1891|p=42}}

'''Pierre Joseph Duhem''' (8 July 1758 – 24 March 1807) was a French physician and politician.

==Early years==
Son of a weaver, he was born in [[Lille]]. He was study supervisor in the [[Collège d'Anchin]] ([[:fr:Collège d'Anchin|fr]]), in [[Douai]], then he obtained his medical doctorate and practised medicine in [[Quesnoy-sur-Deûle]] and in the Douai Hospital.

==Career in Legislative Assembly==
Strong supporter and advocate of [[French Revolution|revolutionary ideas]], he became one of the founder members of the [[National Constituent Assembly|Constitution]] Friends Society (11 November 1789), elected [[justice of the peace]] in Lille in 1790, then elected North member of parliament (MP) to [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] in September 1791 where he sat on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. 
The 17 November 1791, he gained attention in Assembly by giving a violent speech against [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|non-juring priest]]s. He wanted the confinement of War Ministry [[Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara|Narbonne-Lara]] but was disapproved by other MP.
Throughout that period, Duhem carried out active propaganda for republican ideas in the streets, the Assembly and the [[Revolutionary sections of Paris|sections]].
He played a role in the [[10 August (French Revolution)|insurrection of the 10 August]] and, during the night from 10 to 11 August, he presented the decrees suspending the King and calling for a [[National Convention]].
The 20 August 1792, he required to publish a decree concerning [[Arthur Dillon (1750–1794)|General Dillon]] who &quot;lost the confidence of the nation&quot;. The 21 August, he was elected secretary of the National Assembly, then sent on a mission to the [[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North]] where he reported that [[Maubeuge]] was threatened by foreign armies.

==The National Convention member==

In September 1792, he was elected again to the National Convention as North MP. He joined [[the Mountain]] and was sent again on a mission to the Army of the North. The 26 December 1792, he requested a removal measure against the Interior Minister [[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Platière|Roland]] accused of destroying some of the evidence within the [[armoire de fer]] (iron chest) found in the [[Tuileries Palace]], containing documents that indicated Louis XVI's relations with corrupt politicians. He demanded a [[roll-call vote]] for the [[trial of Louis XVI]]. He asked for death sentence without suspensions against the King.
The day of the [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution]], he joined the [[Committee of General Security]] where he sat until June.
He took advantage of his position to be resolutely opposed to [[Girondist]]s and led an armed raid on the printing establishment of [[Antoine Joseph Gorsas]] on March 9, 1793.
From 4 April to 20 July 1793, he was sent again on a mission to the North Army and he denounced the Girondist [[Charles Zachée Varlet]] ([[:fr:Charles-Zachée-Joseph Varlet|fr]]) but he supported suspected Generals as [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|Custine]] and [[Antoine Nicolas Collier|La Marlière]] against [[Jacobin]]s as General [[Jean-Baptiste de Lavalette]] whom he dismissed. But [[Robespierre]] and [[Jean Bon Saint-André]] took the side of Lavalette and Duhem became himself somewhat suspect. The 12 December 1793, Robespierre delivered a speech supporting dismissed Mountain Generals. Duhem was excluded from the club 4 days later.
To save his head, he was never heard again until [[Thermidorian Reaction|9-Thermidor]].

==The insurrection of 12 Germinal, Year III==
Under the Thermidorian regime, Duhem belonged to the group of remaining Montagnards and went after [[Louis-Marie Stanislas Fréron|Fréron]] and [[Jean-Lambert Tallien|Tallien]]. Rather he stood up for [[Bertrand Barère|Barère]], [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne|Billaud-Varenne]] accused of [[Reign of Terror|terrorism]].

Close to the last [[sans-culottes]], he was unable during the [[insurrection of 12 Germinal, Year III]], to reconstruct the bands which in the past had insured the success of the ''journees''. Arrested, he was imprisoned in [[Ham, Somme|Ham]], then in [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] but avoided trial.

Released under the December 1795 amnesty, he joined the North Army as physician.

Nevertheless, he remained politically involved and supported the main [[Jacobin (politics)|neo-jacobin]] movement during [[French Directory|Directory]] as a member of the [[Panthéon Club]]. Dismissed in 1797, he was reinstated through the [[coup of 18 Fructidor]]. In 1798, he was accused of apologising for &quot;the martyrs of the revolt of 1 Prairial Year III&quot;.

==Late career==
Transferred to the Italy Army, then to the West Army, he was posted to the [[Fortress of Mainz|military hospital in Mainz]] ([[Mont-Tonnerre]] French department) in 1802.

Pierre Joseph Duhem died in [[Mainz]] in 1807 at the age of 48.

[[Romanticism]] originated in the 2nd half of the 18th century at the same time as the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;carlyle&quot;&gt;, Carlyle, Thomas. ''The French Revolution: A History Volume I''.  London:  J.M. Dent and Sons, Ltd, 1906.  Pp. viii-xi, 45-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Romanticism continued to grow in reaction to the effects of the social transformation caused by the Revolution. There are many signs of these effects of the French Revolution in various pieces of Romantic literature. By examining the influence of the French Revolution, one can determine that Romanticism arose as a reaction to the French Revolution. Instead of searching for rules governing nature and human beings, the romantics searched for a direct communication with nature and treated humans as unique individuals not subject to scientific rules.

== The influence of the French Revolution ==
The French Revolution played a huge role in influencing Romantic writers. As the Revolution began to play out, the [[absolute monarchy]] that had ruled [[France]] for centuries collapsed in only three years.  This resulted in a complete transformation of [[society]]. A majority of the population was greatly in favor of this as the working class had been suffering [[oppression]] for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;carlyle&quot; /&gt; According to Albert Hancock, in his book ''The French Revolution and the English Poets: a study in historical criticism'', “The French Revolution came, bringing with it the promise of a brighter day, the promise of regenerated man and regenerated earth.  It was hailed with joy and acclamation by the oppressed, by the ardent lovers of [[human]]ity, by the poets, whose task it is to voice the human spirit.”&lt;ref name=&quot;hancock&quot;&gt;, Hancock, Albert Elmer.  ''The French Revolution and the English Poets:  A Study in Historical Criticism''.  New York:  Henry Holt and Company, 1899.  Pp.  7, 45-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common theme among some of the most widely known romantic poets is their acceptance and approval of the French Revolution. [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Lord Byron]], and [[Percy Shelley]] all shared the same view of the [[French Revolution]] as it being the beginning of a change in the current ways of society and helping to improve the lives of the oppressed. As the French Revolution changed the lives of virtually everyone in the nation and even continent because of its drastic and immediate shift in social reformation, it greatly influenced many writers at the time. Hancock writes, “There is no need to recount here in detail how the French Revolution, at the close of the last century, was the great stimulus to the intellectual and emotional life of the civilized world, how it began by inspiring all liberty-loving men with hope and joy.”&lt;ref name=&quot;hancock&quot; /&gt;

Literature began to take a new turn when the spirit of the revolution caught the entire nation and turned things in a whole new direction. The newly acquired freedom of the common people did not only bring about just laws and living but ordinary people also had the freedom to think for themselves, and in turn the freedom to express themselves. Triggered by the revolutionary spirit, the writers of the time were full of creative ideas and were waiting for a chance to unleash them. Under the new laws writers and artists were given a considerable amount of freedom to express themselves which did well to pave the way to set a high standard for literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;gregory&quot;&gt;, Gregory, Allene.  &quot;The French Revolution and the English Novel&quot;.  New York:  The Knickerbocker Press, 1915.  Pp. v-viii, 15-48, 270-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[French Revolution]], poems and literature were typically written about and to [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and [[clergy]], and rarely for or about the working man. However, when the roles of society began to shift resulting from the French Revolution, and with the emergence of Romantic writers, this changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;daiches&quot;&gt;, Daiches, David.  ''A Critical History of English Literature, Volume 2''.  New York:  Ronald Press Co., 1960.  Pp. 860-875.&lt;/ref&gt; Romantic poets such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley started to write works for and about the working man; pieces that the common man could relate to.  According to Christensen, “To get the real animating principle of the Romantic Movement, one must not study it inductively or abstractly; one must look at it historically.  It must be put beside the literary standards of the eighteenth century. These standards impose limits upon the [[Elysium|Elysian fields]] of poetry; poetry must be confined to the common experience of average men… The Romantic Movement then means the revolt of a group of contemporary poets who wrote, not according to common and [[doctrinaire]] standards, but as they individually pleased… there are no principles comprehensive and common to all except those of [[individualism]] and revolt.”&lt;ref name=&quot;christensen&quot;&gt;, Christensen, Jerome.  ''Romanticism at the End of History''.  Baltimore:  The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000.  Pp. 9-20, 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A closer look at the influence of the French Revolution on selected Romantic poets ==
Although the poets mentioned earlier (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley) all share the common theme of approving the [[French Revolution]], they each have their own unique ideas regarding the Revolution itself that have greatly shaped their work. This can be seen by analyzing some of each of their works.

=== Shelley ===
Ever since he was young, [[Percy Shelley]] was very nontraditional. He was born a freethinker and “in spite of all his lovable and generous traits he was a born disturber of the public peace”. At school he was known as “Mad Shelley, the [[Atheist]]”. According to Hancock, “The Goddess of Revolution rocked his cradle.”&lt;ref name=&quot;hancock&quot; /&gt;

Throughout his life Shelley’s opposition toward religion grew less violent; however, he never professed a belief in [[immortality]] or religion of any sort.&lt;ref name=&quot;dieterle&quot;&gt;, Dieterle, Bernard, Engel, Manfred, and Gillespie, Gerald.  &quot;Romantic Prose Fiction&quot;.  Philadelphia:  John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2008.  Pp. 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  His poems declare a belief in the permanence of things that are true and beautiful. Common themes that Shelley incorporated into his works include the hatred of kings, faith in the natural goodness of man, the belief in the corruption of present society, the power of reason, the rights of natural impulse, the desire for a revolution, and liberty, equality and [[fraternity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;christensen&quot; /&gt; These are all clearly shaped by the French Revolution.

=== Byron ===
While Shelley had faith that was founded upon modern ideas, [[Byron]] had faith in nothing. He stood for only destruction. Because of this he was not a true [[revolutionist]] and was rather “the arch-apostle of revolt, of rebellion against constituted authority.”&lt;ref name=&quot;hancock&quot; /&gt; This statement is easily defended as Byron admitted that he resisted authority but offered no substitute.  This is supported by what Byron once wrote, “I deny nothing… but I doubt everything.” He then said later in life, “I have simplified politics into an utter detestation of all existing governments.” &lt;ref name=&quot;towne&quot;&gt;, Towne, Edward Cornelius.  ''Library of the World’s Best Literature:  Biographical Dictionary''.  New York:  R. S. Peale and J. A. Hill Publishers, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Byron believed neither in democracy nor in equality, but opposed all forms of tyranny and all attempts of rulers to control man.

In Byron’s poetry, he incorporated deep feeling, rather than deep thinking, to make his characters strong. Often, Byron portrayed his characters as being in complete harmony with nature, causing the character to lose himself in the immensity of the world. The French Revolution played a huge role in shaping Byron’s beliefs and opposition to monarchy.

=== Wordsworth ===
While Shelley and Byron both proved to support the revolution to the end, both [[Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] joined the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] in fighting it.&lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot;&gt;, Page, Curtis Hidden.  ''British Poets of the Nineteenth Century''.  New York:  Benj. H. Sanborn &amp; Co., 1918.  Pp. v-vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Wordsworth, however is the Romantic poet who has most profoundly felt and expressed the connection of the soul with nature. He saw great value in the immediate contact with nature.  The French Revolution helped to humanize Wordsworth as his works transitioned from extremely natural experiences to facing the realities and ills of life, including society and the Revolution.  From then on, his focus became the interests of man rather than the power and innocence of nature.

=== Coleridge ===
Unlike [[Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] was more open and receptive to the social and political world around him.  He was a very versatile man and he led a life that covered many fields and his work displayed this.&lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot; /&gt;  He was a poet of nature, romance, and the Revolution.  He was a philosopher, a historian, and a political figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;daiches&quot; /&gt;  The [[French Revolution]] played a great role in shaping Coleridge into each of these things.

According to Albert Hancock, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] tended to focus his life on two things.  The first, being to separate himself from the surrounding world and to submerge himself in thought, as a [[poet]].  The second, to play a role in the world’s affairs, as a [[philosopher]], [[historian]], and [[politician]], as mentioned earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;hancock&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">The '''biens nationaux''' were [[properties]] [[confiscated]] during the [[French Revolution]] from the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], the [[monarchy of France|monarchy]], [[émigré]]s, and suspected [[counter-revolutionaries]] for &quot;the good of the nation&quot;.

''Biens'' means &quot;[[goods (disambiguation)|goods]]&quot;, both in the sense of &quot;objects&quot; and in the sense of &quot;benefits&quot;. ''Nationaux'' means &quot;of the nation&quot;. The phrase is in [[middle French]] form, and is in the [[nominative case]], so it literally means both &quot;national things&quot; and &quot;benefits for the nation&quot;.  This can be summarized as &quot;things for the good of the nation&quot;, or simply &quot;national goods&quot;.

The possessions of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were declared [[national property]] by the [[decree]] of November 2, 1789. These were sold to resolve the [[financial crisis]] that caused the Revolution. Later, the properties of [[the Crown]] were given the same treatment.

The concept of national property was later extended to the property of the [[émigré]]s, and the suspected counter-revolutionaries, which were confiscated from March 30, 1792, and sold after the decree of July 27.

==Confiscation of the goods of the clergy==
A few months into the Revolution, the public purse was all but empty. To amend this fiscal problem, the deputy [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] proposed nationalizing the goods of the clergy. Pursuing the proposal, on 2 November 1789, the  ''[[National Constituent Assembly|Assemblée Nationale]]'' voted that all the goods of the clergy &quot;will be placed at the disposal of the nation&quot;, declared to be henceforth ''biens nationaux'', national goods, to be put out to bid at auctions on behalf of the State.

==New currency==
[[Image:Assignat 400 lievres 1792-09-21.jpg|thumb|400px|
''Assignat'' of 400 livres, issued 24 Sept, 1792, first year of the Republic]] 

This legacy, evaluated to just about 3 billion [[French livre|''livres'']], constituted a substantial improvement for public finance. The disposition of these goods was entrusted to a special office, called ''la Caisse de l'Extraordinaire'', which was formed on 19 December 1789.

The difficulty was that the sale of so many ''biens'' would take time, at least a year, while the ''caisses'' of the State were empty and national bankruptcy appeared to be immediate. Therefore, it was decided to produce, the very same day as the creation of ''la Caisse de l'Extraordinaire'', a type of bonds called ''[[assignat]]s''. The value of these bills or bonds was based on the estimated value of the clerical properties. The ''Assignats'' were issued by the National Constituent Assembly.

Initially meant as bonds, the ''assignats'' developed into a paper currency used as [[legal tender]].

==Inflation==

As there was no control over the amount to be printed, the value of the ''assignats'' went beyond the limits of the confiscated properties. This caused [[hyperinflation]]. In the beginning of 1792, they had lost most of their supposed value.

This hyperinflation was inspired by continual food shortages. Rather than solving the financial problems, the ''assignats'' became a cause for food riots. Insecurity continued after the abolition of the monarchy, and the situation got worse with the wars France faced. These circumstances interfered with the completion of good financial policies that would reduce debts. Bills were passed such as the [[Maximum Price Act]] (''loi du maximum général'') of 1793, meant to control price increases.

On 28 December 1793, the Assembly issued the legislation to confiscate the property of individuals regarded as enemies of the Revolution, which included the émigrés and fugitives, hostile priesthood, the deportees, prisoners, those sentenced to death, and the aliens from enemy countries.

When the [[French Directory|''Directoire'']] came into power in 1795 the Maximum Price Act was lifted. High [[monetary inflation]] reemerged and in the next four years Paris was the scene of yet more riots. The ''assignats'' were becoming worthless.

France's financial problems were solved during the [[French Consulate]] when [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], the First Consul, created the country's new currency, the [[:French_franc#French_Empire_and_Restoration|''franc germinal'']], by the law of 28 March 1803 (''loi du 7 Germinal an XI'').

[[Nationalism]] refers to the devotion for one's own nation's interests over those of all other nations. It signifies a particular love for the nation. It  was an important factor in the development of [[Europe]]. In the 19th century, a wave of [[romantic nationalism]] swept the European continent, transforming its countries. Some newly formed countries, such as Germany, Italy and [[Romania]] were formed by uniting various regional states with a common &quot;national identity&quot;. Others, such as Greece, Switzerland, Poland and Bulgaria, were formed by uprisings against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Russia]]. More concisely, nationalism better defined these countries.&lt;ref&gt;slideshare{{clarify|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|right|350px|thumb|Storming of the Bastille, July 14th 1789.]]
The [[French Revolution]] paved the way for the modern [[nation-state]] and also played a key role in the birth of nationalism. Across Europe radical [[intellectuals]], influenced by [[Napoleon]] and the [[Napoleonic Code]] the instrument for the [[political]] transformation of Europe. Revolutionary armies carried the slogan of &quot;[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty, equality and brotherhood]]&quot; and ideas of [[liberalism]] and national self-determinism. National awakening also grew out of an [[intellectual]] reaction to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that emphasized [[national identity]] and developed a [[National romanticism|romantic view]] of [[cultural]] self-expression through [[nationhood]]. The key exponent of the modern idea of the [[nation-state]] was the German [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. Friedrich Hegel]]. He argued that a sense of [[nationality]] was the cement that held modern [[society|societies]] together in the age when [[dynastic]] and [[religious]] allegiance was in decline. In 1815, at the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]], the major powers of Europe tried to restore the old [[dynastic]] system as far as possible, ignoring the principle of [[nationality]] in favour of &quot;[[legitimism]]&quot;, the assertion of [[traditional]] claims to royal authority. With most of Europe's peoples still loyal to their local [[province]] or [[city]], nationalism was confined to small groups of [[intellectuals]] and [[political]] radicals. Furthermore, [[political repression]], symbolized by the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] published in [[Austria]] in 1819, pushed [[nationalist]] agitation underground.

== The struggle for independence ==
 [[Image:Giuseppe Mazzini.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]], campaigner for [[Italian unification]].]]
A strong resentment of what came to be regarded as [[colonialism|foreign]] rule began to develop. In [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Greece]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Norway]] local hostility to alien [[dynastic]] authority started to take the form of [[nationalism|nationalist]] agitation.{{when|date=February 2016}} The first revolt in the [[Ottoman Empire]] to acquire a national character was the [[Serbian Revolution]] (1804–17),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanioğlu2010&quot;/&gt; which was the culmination of the [[Serbian renaissance]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Singleton1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Singleton|title=A Short History of the Yugoslav Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTLSZ3ucaZMC&amp;pg=PA72|date=21 March 1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27485-2|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had begun in Habsburg territory, in [[Sremski Karlovci]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanioğlu2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

The Poles attempted twice to overthrow Russian rule in 1831 and 1846. [[Revolutions of 1848|In 1848, revolutions broke out across Europe]], sparked by severe [[famine]] and [[economic crisis]] and mounting popular demand for political change. In [[Italy]] [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] used the opportunity to encourage a war mission: &quot;A people destined to achieve great things for the welfare of humanity must one day or other be constituted a nation&quot;.
 [[Image:Berliner kongress.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Congress of Berlin]] 1878.]]
In [[Hungary]], [[Lajos Kossuth]] led a national revolt against [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule; in [[Transylvania]], [[Avram Iancu]] led successful revolts in 1848. The 1848 crisis had given nationalism its first full public airing, and in the thirty years that followed no fewer than seven new national states were created in Europe. This was partly the result of the recognition by conservative forces that the old order could not continue in its existing form. Conservative reformers such as [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] made common cause with [[liberalism|liberal]] political modernizers to create a consensus for the creation of conservative nation-states in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. In the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] a compromise was reached with Hungarian nationalists in 1867 granting them virtual independence. Native history and culture were rediscovered and appropriated for the national struggle. Following a conflict between [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]], the [[Congress of Berlin|Great Powers met at Berlin]] in 1878 and granted independence to [[Romania]], [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and a limited autonomy to [[Bulgaria]].

== Nationalism's growth and export ==
[[Image:Herzl.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Theodor Herzl]].]]
The invention of a symbolic [[Nation|national identity]] became the concern of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[ethnic groups|ethnic]] or [[language|linguistic]] groups throughout [[Europe]] as they struggled to come to terms with the rise of [[mass politics]], the decline of the [[Elitism|traditional social elites]], popular [[discrimination]] and [[xenophobia]]. Within the [[Habsburg empire]] the different peoples developed a more mass-based, violent and exclusive form of [[nationalism]]. This developed even among the [[German people|Germans]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]], who actually benefited from the power-structure of the [[empire]]. On the [[Europe]]an periphery, especially in [[Ireland]] and [[Norway]], campaigns for national [[independence]] became more strident. In 1905 [[Norway]] won independence from [[Sweden]], but attempts to grant [[Ireland]] the kind of [[autonomy]] enjoyed by [[Hungary]] foundered on the national divisions on the [[Ireland|island]] between the [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. The Polish attempts to win independence from [[Russian Empire|Russia]] had previously proved to be unsuccessful, with [[Congress Poland|Poland]] being the only country in Europe whose autonomy was gradually limited rather than expanded throughout the 19th century, as a punishment for the failed uprisings; in 1831 Poland lost its status as a formally independent state and was merged into Russia as a [[real union]] country and in 1867 she became nothing more than just another Russian province. Faced with internal and external resistance to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], as well as increased xenophobic [[anti-Semitism]], radical demands began to develop among the stateless [[Jew]]ish population of [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] and [[central Europe]] for their own national home and refuge. In 1897, inspired by the Hungarian-born Jewish nationalist [[Theodor Herzl]], the [[First Zionist Congress]] was held in [[Basel|Basle]], and declared their national 'home' should be in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. By the end of the period, the ideals of [[Europe]]an [[nationalism]] had been exported worldwide and were now beginning to develop, and both compete and threaten the empires ruled by [[Colonialism|colonial]] European nation-states.

'''''Madame Thérèse''''' is a novel jointly written by French authors [[Émile Erckmann]] and [[Alexandre Chatrian]]. It deals with the topics of the [[French Revolution]] and the resulting social upheaval, destruction caused by war, the formation of the [[first French Republic]], the ideals of justice and equality among classes, and friendship and devotion.  The book was first published in French in 1863.  It was translated into English and published under the title ''Madame Thérèse or The volunteers of '92'' by Charles Scribner and Company in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archive.org|title=Madame Thérèse, or, The volunteers of '92 (1903)|url=https://archive.org/details/madamethrseo00erck|publisher=University of California Digital Library|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

The book is told through the eyes of a young boy, Fritz, who lives with his uncle Jacob and housekeeper Lisa in a small village called Anstatt, near the present-day German towns of Kaiserlautern and Landau. After Fritz was orphaned he was adopted by his uncle, who is a doctor for the village and surrounding areas. One day in November 1793, the village awakens to find the French Republican army, who go house-to-house searching for food and supplies for their battalion. The army Colonel comes to doctor Jacob’s house, where his men start baking bread for their soldiers. It is here that little Fritz, doctor Jacob and their housekeeper first meet Thérèse, who is a [[cantinière]] travelling with the French battalion along with her little twelve-year-old brother Jean. The Colonel and the Republican army personnel do not use formal titles such as ‘Madame’ or ‘Monsieur’ when speaking to each other; instead, they address each other mutually using only the salutation ‘citizen’.

Later during the same day, a battle ensues in the village between the French Republicans and the defending armies of the Prussian and Austrian rulers. Fritz witnesses the bloody battle with his own eyes and sees firsthand the loss of lives and destruction of property that war brings. The Republican army is outnumbered and they realise they have to retreat. As the soldiers are departing, they quickly set up a barricade of stolen furniture and straw to block the street and then light it on fire, which soon spreads to nearby houses. Several other Austrian battalions pass through the village throughout the day and the accompanying army doctors and ambulances collect the wounded soldiers who are still alive. The village residents are left with putting out the fire and burying the soldiers who were killed. As the local undertaker and his men are carting away the dead bodies for burial, it is discovered that the cantinière Thérèse, who was wounded and is lying unconscious among the dead, is still alive also. She is rescued by doctor Jacob, who takes her to his house and with the help of friends performs an operation that removes a bullet from her shoulder. After several days, Thérèse regains consciousness. She continues to live and recuperate in doctor Jacob’s house along with her poodle dog Scipio, who becomes a good friend to Fritz. As time passes, Thérèse becomes well-acquainted with and respected by the members of doctor Jacob’s household and his close friends. The relationship that develops between them, as well as the turn of events on the military front, eventually culminates in her marriage to doctor Jacob, the victory of the Republican army over the Prussian forces, and the joyful reunion of Thérèse with her little brother Jean. The reader is left with the impression of a moral victory of the French Republican cause due to their ascribed ideals of social justice, fairness, and equality among classes as personified by the good-natured and kind Thérèse.

== Adaptations ==

The novel was adapted by Chatrian into a play in five acts and performed in the Théâtre du Châtelet on October 9, 1882. It was also adapted into an illustrated series published in 25 parts by the newspaper Libération in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benhamou|first=Noëlle|title=Chronologie des adaptations|url=http://www.erckmann-chatrian.eu/Adaptations/chronologiedesadaptations.html|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==

For the first time, I fully understood what death is; these men that I had seen two minutes before, full of life and strength, charging their enemies with fury, and rushing forward like wolves, lay there, pell-mell, senseless as the stones of the street. (Chapter III)

&quot;Behold what war is, Fritz; -look, and remember! Yes, this is war; death and destruction, fury and hatred, disregard of all human feelings. ''...''here it is man himself, who decrees misery to his kind, spreads his ravages far and wide, without pity. Yesterday, we were at peace; we asked nothing of anybody; we had done no harm; -and suddenly strange men came to strike, to ruin and destroy us. ''...''Fritz, remember this; war is all that is most abominable on earth. Men who do not know, who have never seen each other, rush suddenly together, to tear each other to pieces. This alone would make us believe in God, for there must be an avenger of such iniquity.&quot;  (Chapter IV)

Historians since the late 20th century have debated how women shared in the [[French Revolution]] and what long-term impact it had on [[French women]]. Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France; they were considered &quot;passive&quot; citizens; forced to rely on men to determine what was best for them. That changed dramatically in theory as there seemingly were great advances in feminism. Feminism emerged in Paris as part of a broad demand for social and political reform. The women demanded equality to men and then moved on to a demand for the end of male domination. Their chief vehicle for agitation were pamphlets and women's clubs, especially the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]]. However, the [[Jacobin]] (radical) element in power abolished all the women's clubs in October 1793 and arrested their leaders. The movement was crushed. Devance explains the decision in terms of the emphasis on masculinity in wartime, [[Marie Antoinette]]'s bad reputation for feminine interference in state affairs, and traditional male supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Devance, &quot;Le Féminisme pendant la Révolution Française,&quot; ''Annales Historiques de la Révolution Française'' (1977) 49#3 pp 341-376&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later the  [[Napoleonic Code]] confirmed and perpetuated women's second-class status.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Abray, &quot;Feminism in the French Revolution,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' (1975) 80#1 pp. 43-62 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1859051 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chérieux - Club des femmes patriotes dans une église - 1793.jpg|thumb|Club of patriotic women in a church]]

==Traditional roles==
Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France; they could not vote or hold any political office. They were considered &quot;passive&quot; citizens; forced to rely on men to determine what was best for them in the government. It was the men who defined these categories, and women were forced to accept male domination in the political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Scott &quot;Only Paradoxes to Offer&quot; 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were taught to be committed to their husbands and &quot;all his interests... [to show] attention and care... [and] sincere and discreet zeal for his salvation.&quot; A woman’s education often consisted of learning to be a good wife and mother; as a result women were not supposed to be involved in the political sphere, as the limit of their influence was the raising of future citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Marquise de Maintenon, &quot;Writings&quot; 321&lt;/ref&gt; The subservient role of women prior to the revolution was perhaps best exemplified by the Frederician Code, published in 1750 and attacked by Enlightenment philosophers and publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;belloffenbell often&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan G. Bell and Karen M. Offen, eds.|title=Women, the family, and freedom. 1. 1750 - 1880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibUicWY4SlIC&amp;pg=PA35|year=1983|publisher=Stanford U.P.|pages=29–37|isbn=9780804711715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highly influential ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' in the 1750s set the tone of the Enlightenment, and its ideas exerted influence on the subsequent Revolution in France. Writing a number of articles on women in society, [[Louis de Jaucourt]] criticized traditional roles for women, arguing that &quot;it would be difficult to demonstrate that the husband's rule comes from nature, in as much as this principle is contrary to natural human equality... a man does not invariably have more strength of body, of wisdom, of mind or of conduct than a woman... The example of England and Russia shows clearly that women can succeed equally in both moderate and despotic government...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;belloffenbell often&quot; /&gt; One of greatest influences foreshadowing the revolutionary and republican  transformations in women's roles was Jean-Jacques Rousseau's educational treatise ''Emile'' (1762).&lt;ref&gt;Joan Landes, ''Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
Some liberal men advocated equal rights for women including [[women's suffrage]]. [[Marquis de Condorcet|Nicolas de Condorcet]] was especially noted for his advocacy, in his articles published in the ''Journal de la Société de 1789'', and by publishing ''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité'' [http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/condorcet4.html (&quot;For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women&quot;)] in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;David Williams,&quot;Condorcet, Feminism, and the Egalitarian Principle.&quot; ''Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture'' 5 (1976): 151+.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Brookes, &quot;The feminism of Condorcet and Sophie de Grouchy.&quot; ''Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century'' 189 (1980): 314+&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary action==

When the Revolution started, some women struck forcefully, using the volatile political climate to assert their active natures. In the time of the Revolution, women could not be kept out of the political sphere. They swore oaths of loyalty, &quot;solemn declarations of patriotic allegiance, [and] affirmations of the political responsibilities of citizenship.&quot; [[Charlotte Corday|De Corday d'Armont]] is a prime example of such a woman; engaged in the revolutionary political faction of the [[Girondists]], she assassinated the [[Jacobins|Jacobin]] leader, [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]]. Throughout the Revolution, other women such as [[Pauline Léon]] and her [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] supported the radical Jacobins, staged demonstrations in the National Assembly and participated in the riots, often using armed force.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton &quot;Madame Roland&quot; 262&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist agitation===
{{Main|Militant Feminism in the French Revolution}}
The [[Women's March on Versailles]] is but one example of feminist militant activism during the French Revolution. While largely left out of the thrust for increasing rights of citizens, as the question was left indeterminate in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebel Daughters pg. 79&quot;&gt;Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution Edited by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt; activists such as [[Pauline Léon]] and [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt|Théroigne de Méricourt]] agitated for full citizenship for women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olwen W pg. 23&quot;&gt;Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Women were, nonetheless, &quot;denied political rights of ‘active citizenship’ (1791) and democratic citizenship (1793).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebel Daughters pg. 79&quot;/&gt;

Pauline Léon, on 6 March 1792, submitted a petition signed by 319 women to the National Assembly requesting permission to form a garde national in order to defend Paris in case of military invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olwen W pg. 23&quot;/&gt;  Léon requested permission be granted to women to arm themselves with pikes, pistols, sabers and rifles, as well as the privilege of drilling under the French Guards. Her request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1792, Théroigne de Méricourt made a call for the creation of &quot;legions of amazons&quot; in order to protect the revolution. As part of her call, she claimed that the right to bear arm would transform women into citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Women and the Limits of Citizenship by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:MaratMurder.jpg|thumb|Assassin of Marat]]

On 20 June 1792 a number of armed women took part in a procession that &quot;passed through the halls of the Legislative Assembly, into the Tuilleries Gardens, and then through the King’s residence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  Militant women also assumed a special role in the funeral of [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], following his murder on 13 July 1793. As part of the funeral procession, they carried the bathtub in which Marat had been murdered as well as a shirt stained with Marat’s blood.&lt;ref&gt;Women and the Limits of Citizenship by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The most radical militant feminist activism was practiced by the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]], which was founded by Léon and her colleague, [[Claire Lacombe]] on 10 May 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the club was &quot;to deliberate on the means of frustrating the projects of the enemies of the Republic.&quot; Up to 180 women attended the meetings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Deviant Women of the French Revolution and the Rise of Feminism by Lisa Beckstrand pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Of special interest to the Society was &quot;combating hoarding [of grain and other staples] and inflation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Women and the Limits of Citizenship by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 1793, women were at the fore of a crowd that demanded &quot;bread and the Constitution of 1793.&quot; When their cries went unnoticed, the women went on a rampage, &quot;sacking shops, seizing grain and kidnapping officials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gender, Society and Politics: France and Women 1789–1914 by James H. McMillan pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society demanded a law in 1793 that would compel all women to wear the [[French Revolution#Tricolore cockade|tricolore cockade]] insignia to demonstrate their loyalty to the Republic.  They also repeated their demands for vigorous price controls to keep bread&amp;nbsp;– the major food of the poor people&amp;nbsp;– from becoming too expensive. After the Convention passed the cockade law in September 1793, the Revolutionary Republican Women demanded vigorous enforcement, but were countered by market women, former servants, and religious women who adamantly opposed price controls (which would drive them out of business) and resented attacks on the aristocracy and on religion.  They said that &quot;Only whores and female Jacobins wear cockades.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dominique Godineau|title=The Women of Paris and Their French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHNZKRWcp58C&amp;pg=PA160|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|pages=160–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fist fights broke out in the streets between the two factions of women.&lt;ref&gt;Darline Gay Levy, Harriet Branson Applewhite and Mary Durham Johnson, eds.  ''Women in Revolutionary Paris, 1789-1795''  (1981) pp 143-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the men who controlled the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers.  At this point the Jacobins controlled the government; they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, and decreed that all women's clubs and associations were illegal.  They sternly reminded women to stay home and tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men.  Organized women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after October 30, 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Levy et al. ''Women in Revolutionary Paris, 1789-1795''  (1981) pp 143-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these outwardly activist women were punished for their militancy. The kind of punishment received during the Revolution included public denouncement, arrest, execution, or exile. Théroigne de Méricourt was arrested, publicly flogged and then spent the rest of her life sentenced to an insane asylum. Pauline Léon and Claire Lacombe were arrested, later released, and continued to receive ridicule and abuse for their activism. Many of the women of the Revolution were even publicly executed for &quot;conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Deviant Women by Beckstrand pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women writers===
[[File:Marie-Olympe-de-Gouges.jpg|thumb|[[Olympe de Gouges]] was the author of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' in 1791.]]
While some women chose a militant, and often violent, path, others chose to influence events through writing, publications, and meetings. [[Olympe de Gouges]] wrote a number of plays, short stories, and novels. Her publications emphasized that women and men are different, but this shouldn’t stop them from equality under the law. In her &quot;Declaration on the Rights of Woman&quot; she insisted that women deserved rights, especially in areas concerning them directly, such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Gouges Writings 564–568&quot;&gt;De Gouges &quot;Writings&quot; 564–568&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gouges also expressed non-gender political views; even before the start of the terror, Olympe de Gouges addressed Robespierre using the pseudonym &quot;Polyme&quot; calling him the Revolution’s &quot;infamy and shame.&quot; She warned of the Revolution’s building extremism saying that leaders were &quot;preparing new shackles if [the French people’s liberty were to] waver.&quot; Stating that she was willing to sacrifice herself by jumping into the Seine if Robespierre were to join her, de Gouges desperately attempted to grab the attention of the French citizenry and alert them to the dangers that Robespierre embodied.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Gouges Writings 564–568&quot;/&gt; In addition to these bold writings, her defense of the king was one of the factors leading to her execution. An influential figure, one of her suggestions early in the Revolution, to have a voluntary, patriotic tax, was adopted by the National Convention in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Mousset &quot;Women’s Rights&quot; 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madame Roland]] (aka Manon or Marie Roland) was another important female activist. Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation. She focused on other aspects of the government, but was a feminist by virtue of the fact that she was a woman working to influence the world. Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy; in addition, she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins, a political group which allowed women to join.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalton Madame Roland 262–267&quot;&gt;Dalton &quot;Madame Roland&quot; 262–267&lt;/ref&gt;

While limited by her gender, Madame Roland took it upon herself to spread Revolutionary ideology and spread word of events, as well as to assist in formulating the policies of her political allies. Unable to directly write policies or carry them through to the government, Roland influenced her political allies and thus promote her political agenda. Roland attributed women’s lack of education to the public view that women were too weak or vain to be involved in the serious business of politics. She believed that it was this inferior education that turned them into foolish people, but women &quot;could easily be concentrated and solidified upon objects of great significance&quot; if given the chance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalton Madame Roland 262–267&quot;/&gt;

As she was led to the scaffold, Madame Roland shouted &quot;O liberty! What crimes are committed in thy name!&quot; Witnesses of her life and death, editors, and readers helped to finish her writings and several editions were published posthumously. While she did not focus on gender politics in her writings, by taking an active role in the tumultuous time of the Revolution, Roland took a stand for women of the time and proved they could take an intelligent active role in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Walker &quot;Virtue&quot; 413–416&lt;/ref&gt;

Though women did not gain the right to vote as a result of the Revolution, they still greatly expanded their political participation and involvement in governing. They set precedents for generations of feminists to come.

===Counter-revolutionary Women===
A major aspect of the French Revolution was the [[dechristianisation]] movement, a movement that many common people did not agree with. Especially for women living in rural areas of France, the demise of the [[Catholic Church]] meant a loss of normalcy. For instance, the ringing of Church bells resonating through the town called people to confession and was a symbol of unity for the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hufton, Olwen pg. 106-107&quot;&gt;Hufton, Olwen. Women and the Limits of Citizenship 1992 pg. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; With the onset of the [[dechristianisation]] campaign the Republic silenced these bells and sought simultaneously to silence the religious fervor of the majority [[Catholic]] population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hufton, Olwen pg. 106-107&quot;/&gt;

When these revolutionary changes to the Church were implemented, it spawned a [[counter-revolutionary]] movement, particularly amongst women. Although some of these women embraced the political and social amendments of the Revolution, they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and the formation of revolutionary cults like the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] advocated by [[Robespierre]].&lt;ref&gt;Desan pg. 452&lt;/ref&gt; As Olwen Hufton argues, these women began to see themselves as the &quot;defenders of faith&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hufton, Olwen pg. 303&quot;&gt;Hufton, Olwen. &quot;In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.&quot; 1998 pg. 303&lt;/ref&gt; They took it upon themselves to protect the Church from what they saw as a heretical change to their faith, enforced by revolutionaries.

Counter-revolutionary women resisted what they saw as the intrusion of the state into their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, ''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' 1992 pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Economically, many peasant women refused to sell their goods for [[assignats]] because this form of currency was unstable and was backed by the sale of confiscated Church property.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, &quot;In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.&quot; pg. 303&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; By far the most important issue to counter-revolutionary women was the passage and the enforcement of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] in 1790. In response to this measure, women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic.  This diminished the social and political influence of the juring priests because they presided over smaller congregations and counter-revolutionary women did not seek them for baptisms, marriages or confession. Instead, they secretly hid [[nonjuring]] priests and attended clandestine traditional masses.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, Olwen. Women and the Limits of Citizenship 1992 pg. 104-5&lt;/ref&gt; These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, &quot;In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.&quot; 1998 pg. 304, 311&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this determined resistance to the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] and the [[dechristianisation]] campaigns that played a major role in the re-emergence of the Catholic Church as a prominent social institution. Olwen Hufton notes about the Counter-Revolutionary women: &quot;for it is her commitment to her religion which determines in the post-Thermidorean period the re-emergence of the Catholic Church...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, &quot;In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.&quot; 1998 pg. 305&lt;/ref&gt;  Although they struggled, these women were eventually vindicated in their bid to reestablish the Church and thereby also to reestablish traditional family life and social stability. This was seen in the [[Concordat of 1801]], which formally reinstated the Catholic Church in France.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, &quot;In Search of Counter-Revolutionary Women.&quot; 1998 pp. 130, 326&lt;/ref&gt; This act came after years of attempts at [[dechristianisation]] or state-controlled religion, which were thwarted in part due to the resistance of religiously devout counter-revolutionary women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="183637">'''Paris in the 18th century''' was the second-largest city in Europe, after London, with a population of about 600,000 persons. The century saw the construction of [[Place Vendôme]], the [[Place de la Concorde]], the [[Champs-Élysées]], the church of [[Les Invalides]], and the [[Panthéon (Paris)|Panthéon]], and the founding of the [[Louvre Museum]]. Paris witnessed the end of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], was the center stage of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]], saw the first manned flight, and was the birthplace of high fashion and the modern restaurant.

==Paris at the end of the reign of Louis XIV==
[[File:LouisXIVLesInvalides1706.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Louis XIV makes his last visit to Paris to see the new dome of Les Invalides (1706)]]

===“The new Rome”===
[[Louis XIV]] distrusted the Parisians; when he was young he had been forced to flee the city twice, and he did not forget it. He moved his residence from the [[Tuileries Palace]] to the [[Palace of Versailles]] in 1671, and moved his entire court to Versailles in 1682. But while he disliked the Parisians, he wanted Paris to be a monument to his glory; he declared in 1666 that he wished to &quot;do for Paris what Augustus had done for Rome.&quot;{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=103}} He decorated the city with new squares and public buildings; the ''[[Collège des Quatre-Nations]]'' (1662–1672); the ''[[Pont Royal]]'' in 1685, and in the same year began construction of two new monumental squares: ''[[Place des Victoires]]'' and ''Place Louis le Grand'', (now ''[[Place Vendôme]]''). He also began the ''[[Hôtel des Invalides]]'' (1671–1678), a residence and hospital for wounded soldiers. In 1699, a monumental equestrian statue of the King was dedicated in the center of the ''place Vendôme''. During his reign, Louis XIV spent more than 200 million livres for new buildings, of which ten percent was spent in Paris; ten million for rebuilding the Louvre and the Tuileries; 3.5 million for the new factories of Gobelins and the Savonnerie; and a little more than 2 million for Les Invalides.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=75}}

Several new churches were also begun during the reign of Louis XIV, but not finished until well into the 18th century; these included the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of Saint-Sulpice]], whose cornerstone was laid by the Queen, Anne of Austria, in 1646, but not finished until 1745; the [[Church of Saint-Roch, Paris|Church of Saint-Roch]], begun in 1653 and finished in 1740; the church of [[Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet]] (1656–1765); and the church of [[Église Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin (Paris)|Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin]] (1683–1770).{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=110}}
[[File:Einzug des Alvise Mocenigo in Paris 1709.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Place Royale, now [[Place des Vosges]], in 1709. The square was a fashionable area until the French Revolution, though most of the nobility have left beyond Saint-Germain des Pres ]]

Louis XIV also made a dramatic change to the borders of the city; he decided that Paris wasn't secure from any enemy attack, and had the old ring of walls and fortifications demolished. The old city gates were replaced by ceremonial arches, celebrating his victories; the [[Porte Saint-Denis]] (1672) and [[Porte Saint-Martin]] (1674). The walls were pulled down and replaced by wide boulevards, which in the 18th century became the most popular promenades for Parisians.

The administration of the city was complicated and deliberately divided, designed to keep the city tightly under royal authority. The position of Governor of Paris, held by a duke, was purely ceremonial, as was the position of the Provost of Paris, earlier held by a leading merchant, but in the early 18th century by a nobleman. Their powers were shared with the Intendant of Paris, a high noble with rather vague duties, the Bureau of the City, the Procureur-General of the Parliament, the Civil Lieutenant of the [[Grand Châtelet|Châtelet]], and the Secretary of State of the King's Household, who had the title &quot;Minister of Paris&quot;, but reported to the Controller General of Finances. The position of Lieutenant-General of Police of Paris was created in 1667, and given to [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]], the first police chief of the city, and he became a sort of Vice-Minister. All of these officials were responsible for some part of the city's business, but all important decisions had to be made by the King and his council.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=113}}

Despite the grandeur of the new monuments, the center of the city at the beginning of the 18th century was overcrowded, dark, unhealthy, and had little light, air, or drinking water. It was also dangerous, despite the addition of the first metal lanterns on the main streets and the enlargement of the police night watch to four hundred men.

The last years of the King's long reign were marked by natural catastrophes which caused great suffering for the Parisians; they began with a bad harvest followed by a famine in the winter of 1692-1693. Dozens of large ovens were built in the courtyard of the Louvre to bake bread for the poor, but the distribution of the loaves at central points around the city resulted in fighting and riots. That winter, fourteen or fifteen people a day died of hunger at the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel Dieu]] hospital next to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=76-77}} Another bad harvest and severe winter hit Paris in 1708-1709, with temperatures reaching below 20 degrees (Celsius). The Seine froze from January 26 until April 5, making it impossible to deliver grain to the city by boat. During the summer of 1709, the government announced the creation of workshops for the poor and unemployed, who would receive 1.5 pounds of bread and two sous for each day of work. Six thousand persons lined up before dawn near the ''Porte Saint-Martin'' for two thousand available jobs. Riots followed, the crowds attacked ''[[Les Halles]]'', and Musketeers had to occupy the main streets and squares to restore order. Placards criticizing the King and his government began to appear on the city gates, the churches and the main squares.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=76-77}}

On 28 August 1706 Louis XIV made his last visit to Paris to see the construction of the new chapel, with a great gilded dome, he was building for the ''Hôtel des Invalides''.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=106}} He died on September 1, 1715. [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Louis de Rouvroy, the Duke of Saint-Simon]] wrote in his memoirs that, at the news of the King's death, &quot;the people, ruined, crippled, desperate, gave thanks to God.&quot;{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=78}}

==Paris under Louis XV==
[[File:Pierre-Denis Martin 003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Louis XV]], five years old and the new King, makes a grand exit from the Royal Palace on the ''Île de la Cité'' (1715).]]	
Immediately following the death of Louis XIV, his nephew, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d’Orléans]], manoeuvered the Parlement into breaking the King's will and naming him the Regent for the five-year-old king [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. On 12 September, the Regent had the child King brought to the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|''Palais de Justice'']] to ratify his Regency, and then to the ''[[Château de Vincennes]]''. On 30 December, the young King was installed in the [[Tuileries Palace]], while the Regent took up residence in his family's palace, the ''[[Palais Royal]]'', the former ''Palais-Cardinal'' of [[Cardinal Richelieu]].

Under the Regent, the pleasures and amusements forbidden in Paris during the last years of Louis XIV were resumed. The ''[[Comédie-Italienne]]'' theater company had been banned from Paris in 1697 for presenting a thinly disguised satire about the King's wife, [[Françoise d'Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon|''Madame de Maintenon'']], called ''La Fausse Prude''. The Regent invited the company back and that they perform at the ''Palais-Royal'' on 18 May 1716. The company moved to their own stage, the ''Théâtre-Italien'' in the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|''Hôtel de Bourgogne'']], where they performed in his presence on 1 June 1716. In November 1716, the pleasure-loving Regent brought back another Paris amusement, the masked balls; these were held three times a week at the opera hall of the Palais-Royal. Masks were obligatory; a high admission charge of four [[French livre|''livres'']] kept out undesirable guests.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=79}}

The young King was educated in Paris under the guidance of the Regent. He played on the terrace of the [[Tuileries Garden]], had his own private zoo, and a room filled with scientific instruments telescopes, microscopes, compasses, mirrors, and models of the planets, where he was instructed by members of the Academy of Sciences. A printing press was installed in the palace for him to learn typography. He was taken hunting in the ''[[Bois de Boulogne]]'' and the ''[[Bois de Vincennes]]''. In 1720 and 1721, when he was just ten, the young King himself danced before for the court and public in ballet performances in the [[Théâtre des Tuileries|''Salle des Machines'']] of the Tuileries Palace.{{sfn|Antoine|1989|pages=64-67}}

The Regent also made an important contribution to the intellectual life of Paris. In 1719, he moved the Royal library to the ''Hôtel de Nevers'' near the ''Palais-Royal'', where it eventually became the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]'' (National Library of France). The king and government remained in Paris for seven years.

===Monuments===
[[File:Place Louis XV - Projet de Gabriel.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Design of [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] for Place Louis XV, now the [[Place de la Concorde]]]]
In 1722, Louis XV returned the court to Versailles, and visited the city only on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;
While he rarely came into Paris, he did make important additions to the city's landmarks. His first major building was the ''[[École Militaire]]'', a new military school, on the Left Bank. Work began in 1753 and was completed in 1760, when the King first visited it. A chapel for the school was begun in 1768, and finished in 1773.{{sfn|Antoine|1989|pages 558-559}}

Louis XIV had promised to build a new church dedicated to Saint Genevieve, but it had never gotten underway. Louis XV laid the first stone for the new church on 6 September 1764. For the opening, a temporary portico of light materials was erected, to show what the church would look like. It was not completed until 1790, at the time of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, when it became the ''[[Panthéon]]''.{{sfn|Antoine|1989|pages 558-559}}

In 1748, the Academy of Arts commissioned a monumental statue of the king on horseback by the sculptor [[Bouchardon]], and the Academy of Architecture was assigned to create a square, to be called ''Place Louis XV'', where it could be erected. The site selected was the marshy open space between the Seine, the moat and bridge to the Tuileries garden, and the [[Champs-Élysées]], which led to the ''Étoile'', convergence of hunting trails on the western edge of the city (now ''[[Place Charles de Gaulle|Place Charles de Gaulle-Étoile]]''). The winning plans for the square and buildings next to it were drawn by the architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]. Gabriel designed two large mansions with a street between them, [[Rue Royale, Paris|''Rue Royale'']], designed to give a clear view of the statue in the center of the square. Construction began in 1754, and the statue was put in place and dedicated on 23 February 1763. The two large mansions were still unfinished, but the ''façades'' were finished in 1765-66.{{sfn|Antoine|1989|pages=556-557}}
[[File:4 saisons vue d'ensembleG.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The [[Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons]] (1774) was monumental, but originally had only two small water spouts for filling containers]]
The other monumental major building projects of Louis XV were all on the Left Bank: a new mint, the [[Hôtel des Monnaies, Paris|''Hôtel des Monnaies'']], with a 117-meter façade along the Seine (1767–1775); a new medical school, the ''[[École de Chirurgie]]'', designed by [[Jacques Gondouin]] (1771–1775), and a new theater for the ''[[Comédie Française]]'', called the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|''Théâtre de l'Odéon'']], designed by the architects [[Charles de Wailly]] and [[Marie-Joseph Peyre]], which was begun in 1770, but not finished until 1774.{{sfn|Antoine|1989|pages=556-560}}

In addition to classical buildings, Louis XV constructed a monumental fountain, the [[Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons]], richly decorated with classical sculpture by the [[Bouchardon]] glorifying the King, at 57-59 rue de la Grenelle. While the fountain was huge, and dominated the narrow street, it originally had only two small spouts, from which residents of the neighborhood could fill their water containers. It was criticized by [[Voltaire]] in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, as the fountain was still under construction:

{{quote|I have no doubt that Bouchardon will make of this fountain a fine piece of architecture; but what kind of fountain has only two faucets where the water porters will come to fill their buckets? This isn't the way fountains are built in Rome to beautify the city. We need to lift ourselves out of taste that is gross and shabby. Fountains should be built in public places, and viewed from all the gates. There isn't a single public place in the vast [[faubourg Saint-Germain]]; that makes my blood boil. Paris is like [[Daniel 2|the statue of Nabuchodonosor]], partly made of gold and partly made of muck.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Voltaire to Caylus, extract published in A. Roserot (1902), cited by Rabreau, pg. 99.Translation by D.R Siefkin.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Parisians==
There was no official census of the Parisians before 1801, but based on parish records and other sources, most historians estimate that the population of Paris was about 500,000 persons at the beginning of the 18th century and grew to between 600,000 and 650,000 shortly before the Revolution of 1789. Following the [[Reign of Terror]], economic hardship and the emigration of the nobility, the 1801 census reported that the population had dropped to 546,856, but it quickly recovered to reach 622,636 in 1811.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=281-283}} It was no longer the largest city in Europe; London passed it in population in about 1700, but it was by far the largest city in France, and throughout the 18th century grew at a rapid rate, largely by an immigration from the Paris basin and from the north and east of France. The center of the city became more and more crowded; building lots became smaller and buildings taller, to four, five and even six stories. In 1784, the height of buildings was finally limited to nine [[Toise|''toises'']], or about eighteen meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarmant, Thierry p. 129-131&quot;&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'', pp. 129-131&lt;/ref&gt;

===The nobles===
[[File:Hotel de Brunoy.jpg|thumb|300px|The Hotel de Brunoy, the town house of the Duke de Brunoy on the rue de Faubourg Saint-Honoré, seen from the Champs-Élysées (1779)]]

Until the 1789 Revolution, Paris had a strict social hierarchy, whose customs and rules were established by long tradition. It was described by [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] in the ''Le Tableau de Paris'', written in 1783: &quot;There are in Paris eight distinct classes; the princes and great nobles (these are the least numerous); the [[Nobles of the Robe]]; the financiers; the traders and merchants; the artists; the craftsmen; the manual workers; the servants; and the ''bas peuple'' (lower class).&quot;{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=428}}

The nobility, including the upper levels of the clergy, who were closely connected with them by family ties, numbered only about three or four percent of the population; their number was estimated by modern historians at about twenty thousand men, women and children. At the very top of the nobility were the Dukes and Pairs, numbering about forty families, including that of the ''duc d'Orléans'', who spent two million livres a year, and owned the ''Palais-Royal''. Below them were about a hundred families with incomes between 10,000 and 50,000 livres a year, including many high-ranking military men, magistrates, and financiers. The old nobility received their income from their estates, while newer nobles depended upon payments they received from the royal government in Versailles for various government positions and titles they held.{{sfn|Roche|2015|page=92}}

The nobility had greatly expanded under Louis XIV, who liberally awarded or sold titles to men who had served the royal government. By 1726, two-thirds of the members of the Estates-General, who largely lived in Paris, had acquired or were in the process of acquiring noble status. The playwright [[Beaumarchais]], the son of a watchmaker, was able to buy a title. Wealthy merchants and financiers were often able to obtain noble status for their families by marrying daughters to members of the old nobility.{{sfn|Roche|2015|page=92}}

Nobles who went into military service automatically received high ranks because of their status; they entered the service at the age of fifteen or sixteen, and, if they were well connected, could expect to command a regiment by the time they were only twenty-five. The children of the nobility attended the most select schools in Paris; the ''Collège de Clermont'', and especially the Jesuit college of [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand|''Louis-le-Grand'']]. In addition to their academic courses, they were taught fencing and horsemanship.

At the beginning of the 18th century, most of the noble families had their large ''hôtels particuliers'', or town houses, in the [[Le Marais|Marais]] neighborhood, but over the course of the century they moved to the neighborhoods of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, near the ''Palais Royal'', and especially to the left bank, to the new ''[[Faubourg Saint-Germain]]'' or north-west to the [[Luxembourg Palace]]. By 1750, only about ten percent of noble families still resided in the ''Marais''.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=429}}

By 1763, the ''Faubourg Saint-Germain'' had replaced the ''Marais'' as the most fashionable residential neighborhood for the aristocracy and the wealthy, but the Marais never completely lost all of its nobility, and always remained fashionable until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. They built magnificent private residences there, in the Faubourg, many of which later became government residences or institutions; the ''Hôtel d'Évreux'' (1718–1720) later became the [[Élysée Palace]], the residence of the Presidents of the Republic; the ''[[Hôtel Matignon]]'' became the residence of the Prime Minister; the ''[[Palais Bourbon]]'' became the home of the National Assembly; the Hôtel Salm became the [[Palace of the Legion of Honor]], and the ''Hôtel de Biron'' eventually became the [[Rodin Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'', pp. 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

===The wealthy and the middle class===

The ''bourgeois'', or members of the middle class of Paris, financiers, merchants, shopkeepers, artisans, and those in the liberal professions (doctors, lawyers, accountants, teachers, government officials) were a growing social class. They were specifically defined by law as persons who had lived in the city at least a year in their own residence, and earned enough money to pay taxes. In 1780, there were an estimated 25,000 Paris households who fell into this category, about fourteen percent of the total.{{sfn|Garrich|2015|page=108}} Many of those in the upper middle class rose from modest social origins to amass very large fortunes. Many of the wealthiest bourgeois built their own palatial town houses in the ''Faubourg Saint-Germain'', in the Montmartre quarter, the banking center of the city, or close to the ''Palais Royal''. The upper middle class, once they had made their fortunes, frequently lived by buying the debts and collecting ''rentes'' from the nobility and the government, which during the 18th century were both always short of cash.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=463}} While the nobles tended to dress in rich and elaborate costumes and bright colors, the bourgeois wore rich fabrics but dark and sober colors. The bourgeois played a very active role in each neighborhood; they were the leaders of the religious ''confréries'' which organized charitable and religious activities for each profession, managed the finances of the parish churches, and ran the corporations which governed each profession in Paris.

Some professions were able to advance up the professional and social scale. At the beginning of the 18th century, doctors were members of the same professional corporation as barbers, and required no special training. In 1731, they established the first Society of Surgeons, and in 1743, a university medical degree was required to practice surgery. In 1748, the Society of Surgeons became the [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Academy of Surgery]]. The lawyers followed the same path; at the beginning of the 18th century, the University of Paris taught only church law. In the 1730s, the lawyers formed their own association and began to provide formal professional training in civil law.{{sfn|Garrioch|2015|page=1115}}

Forty-three percent of Parisian property owners were merchants or belonged to the liberal professions; thirty percent were shopkeepers and master artisans, who usually had had one or two employees and one servant, and lived above or behind their shop or workshop.{{sfn|Garrioch|2015|page=1112}}

The skilled workers and craftsmen of Paris had been divided for centuries into ''métiers'' or professions. In 1776, there were 125 recognized ''métiers'', ranging from barbers, apothecaries, bakers and cooks to sculptors, barrel-makers, lace-makers and musicians. Each ''métier'' or profession had its own corporation, rules, customs, and patron saint. The corporation set prices, controlled entry into the profession, and provided charitable services, including paying for the funeral, of members. In 1776, the government tried to reform the system, and consolidated the ''métiers'' into six corporations: the ''drapiers'', or cloth-dealers; ''bonnetiers'', who made and sold hats; ''épiciers'', who sold food products; ''merciers'', who sold clothing; ''pelletiers'', or fur merchants, and ''orfèvres'', who included silversmiths, goldsmiths, and jewelers.{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|page=99}}

===Workers, servants and the poor===
[[File:Études prises dans le bas peuple ou les Cris de Paris - Cotterets.jpg|thumb|right|200px|a woman selling firewood (1737)]]
Most Parisians belonged to the working class or the poor. There were some forty thousand domestic servants, mostly working for middle-class families. Most came from the provinces; only five percent were born in Paris. They lived with the families they served, and their living and working conditions depended entirely on character of their employers. They received very low wages, worked long hours, and if they lost their job, or if a woman became pregnant, they had little hope of getting another position.{{sfn|Garrioch|2015|page=41}} A large portion of the working poor, especially women and including many children, worked at home, sewing, embroidering, making lace, dolls, toys and other products for small shops.

An unskilled male worker earned about twenty to thirty ''sous'' a day (there were twenty ''sous'' in a ''livre''); a woman earned about half as much. A skilled mason could earn fifty ''sous''. A four-pound loaf of bread cost eight or nine ''sous''. A family with two children, where both parents worked, consumed two four-pound loaves a day. Because there were between 110 and 150 holidays, Sundays and other non-working days, families often spent half their income on bread alone. In 1700, the minimum rent for an attic room was thirty to forty ''livres'' a year; rent for two rooms was a minimum of sixty ''livres''.{{sfn|Garrioch|2015|pages=58-59}}

The indigent, those who were unable to support themselves, were numerous, and largely depended upon religious charity or public assistance to survive. They included the elderly, widows with children, the sick, the handicapped and the injured. In 1743, the curate of Saint-Médard in the poor Faubourg Saint-Marcel reported that of the 15,000 to 18,000 people in his parish, some 12,000 needed assistance to survive, even during good economic periods. In 1708, in the wealthier [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice parish]]), there were 13,000 to 14,000 poor who received assistance. One historian, [[Daniel Roche (historian)|Daniel Roche]], estimated that in 1700 there were between 150,000 and 200,000 indigent persons in Paris, or about a third of the population. The number grew in times of economic hardship. This included only those who were officially recognized and assisted by the churches and the city.{{sfn|Garrioch|2015|pages=53-55}}

The working class Parisians and the poor were concentrated in the crowded maze of streets in the center of the city, on the Île de la Cité or close to the central market at [[Les Halles]], and in the eastern neighborhood of the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]] (One of the reasons the nobility slowly moved to the Faubourg Saint-Germain), where thousands of small workshops and the furniture business were located, or on the Left Bank, near the [[Bièvre (river)|Bièvre River]], where the tanners and dyers were located. In the years just before the Revolution, these neighborhoods were flooded with thousands unskilled immigrants from the poorer regions of France. In 1789, these unemployed and hungry workers became the foot soldiers of the Revolution.

==The Economy==

===Banking and finance===
In the domain of finance and banking, Paris was far behind other European capitals, and even other French cities. The first venture of Paris into modern finance was launched by the Scottish economist [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], who, encouraged by the Regent, in 1716 started a private bank and issued paper money. Law invested heavily in the [[Mississippi Company]], causing wild speculation, with shares rising to sixty times their original value. The bubble burst in 1720, and Law closed the bank and fled the country, ruining many Parisian investors. Thereafter, Parisians were suspicious of banks and bankers. The [[Paris Bourse|''Bourse'']], or Paris stock market, did not open until 24 September 1724 on ''rue Vivienne'', in the former ''hôtel de Nevers'', long after stock markets had existed in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulouse and other cities. The ''[[Banque de France]]'' was not founded until 1800, long after the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] (1609), and the [[Bank of England]] (1694).

Throughout the 18th century, the government was unable to pay its mounting debts. As [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] wrote, the taxpayers of France were obliged to pay for &quot;a war badly begun and badly supported, the greed of a prime minister, of a favorite, of a mistress, of foolish expenditures, and the prodigality of a King, which soon exhausted a bank and… undermined the Kingdom.&quot;.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=476}} The ruined finances of the kingdom, and the dismissal by Louis XVI of his finance minister, the Swiss-born [[Jacques Necker]], led Paris directly into the French Revolution in 1789.{{sfn|Fierro|thumb|page=477}}

===Luxury Goods===
[[File:Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory - One of a Pair of Potpourri Vases (Vases ovales Mercure) - Walters 48635 - Back.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A vase from the [[Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory]] (about 1770) in the Walters Art Museum]] 
During the 18th century, French royal workshops produced jewelry, snuff boxes, watches, porcelain, carpets, silverware, mirrors, tapestries, furniture and other luxury goods not only for the French Court, but also for the Empresses of Russia, the Emperor of Austria, and the other courts of Europe. Louis XV oversaw royal manufacturers of tapestries ([[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]] and Beauvais), of carpets ([[Savonnerie manufactory]]), and established a royal workshop to make fine dishes at the
''[[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]]'' between 1753 ann 1757. In 1759, the Sèvres manufactory became his personal property; the first French-made [[porcelain]] was presented to him on 21 December 1769. He gave complete services as gifts to the King of Denmark and the Queen of Naples, and established the first annual exhibition of porcelain at Versailles beginning in 1769. The chair-makers, upholsterers. wood carvers, and foundries of Paris were kept busy making luxury furnishings, statues, gates, door knobs, ceilings, and architectural ornament for the royal palaces and for the new town houses of the nobility in the ''Faubourg Saint-Germain''.{{sfn|Antoine|1989|page=566}}

===High Fashion===
[[File:François Boucher 008.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The ''Modiste'', by François Boucher (1746)]]
Fashion and [[haute couture]] was a flourishing business in the mid and late 18th century, as the aristocrats copied the styles of clothing worn by the Queen and her court, and the wives of Paris bankers and wealthy merchants copied the styles worn by the aristocrats. The fashion industry was formally born in 1776, when the guild of fashion merchants (''marchands de mode''), along with plume merchants and florists, was officially separated from the ''mercers'', those who sold ordinary clothing. By 1779 two hundred different models of hats were being sold in Paris, at prices ranging from ten to one hundred pounds, along with every other possible fashion item.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=999}} 
[[File:Marie-Antoinette, 1775 - Musée Antoine Lécuyer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marie Antoinette wears an elaborate pouf designed by her hair stylist, [[Léonard Autié]] (1775)]]
The most prominent name in fashion was [[Rose Bertin]], who made dresses for [[Marie Antoinette]]; in 1773 she opened a shop called the ''Grand Mogol'' on the Faubourg rue Saint-Honoré that catered to the wealthiest and most fashion-conscious Parisians. The dressmaker's shops in the galleries of the [[Palais Royal]] were another important place for seeing and having copies made of the latest dresses, hats, shoes, shawls, ribbons and other accessories. A specialized press developed to provide illustrations of the new fashions to the wealthy consumers of the European capitals. The first Paris fashion journal ''Le Journal des Dames'' appeared in 1774, followed by the ''Galerie des modes et du costume française'' in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire historique de Paris'', (2013), Le Livre de Poche, ISBN 978-2-253-13140-3, pages 468-469&lt;/ref&gt; The shop of Rose Bertin went out of business with the Revolution and the disappearance of her clients. but she continued to supply ribbons and other modest items to Marie-Antoinette during her imprisonment in the Temple until her execution.

The Paris perfume industry also emerged in its modern form in the second part the 18th century, after the guild of perfumers separated from the guild of glove-makers. The perfumes were usually made in [[Grasse]], in Provence, but the shops that sold them were opened in Paris. In 1798 the perfumer of the Queen, Pierre-François Lubin, opened a perfume shop at 53 rue Helvétius (now rue Sainte-Anne), with the name ''au Bouquet de Roses.'' Other perfumers opened similar shops catering to wealthy Parisians and visitors.

Wig-makers and hair stylists also made their fortunes from wealthy and aristocratic Parisian clients. Powdered wigs for men continued to be the fashion, even during the Revolution; the architect of the Reign of Terror, Robespierre, wore a powdered wig until his own execution. The hair stylist of Marie-Antoinette, [[Léonard Autié]], known simply as Monsieur Leonard, created extravagant poufs and other towering hair styles that were eagerly imitated by the court and the wealthiest Parisiennes.

Throughout the century, fashion was a sign of the social class of the person wearing the clothes. Aristocrats, men and women, wore the most expensive, colorful and elaborate fabrics; bankers and merchants wore more sober colors, usually dark brown, green or blue, to show their seriousness, though their wives dressed as richly as aristocrats. Men wore [[culottes]], a type of tight short trouser attached below the knee to silk stockings. The Revolutionaries and poor mocked the rich by calling themselves the ''sans-culottes'', those without culottes. With the Revolution and the disappearance of the aristocrats, men's clothing became less colorful and more sober, and women's clothing began to imitate the popular view of the clothing of ancient Rome and Greece, in keeping with the revolutionary ideals of the new French Republic.

===From workshops to factories===
[[File:Encyclopédie Paper manufacturing.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Illustration of paper manufacturing, from Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'']]
During most of the 18th century, the Parisian economy was based on thousands of small workshops, where skilled artisans produced products. The workshops were clustered in particular neighborhoods; furniture makers in the ''faubourg Saint-Antoine''; cutlery and small metal-work in neighborhood called the [[Quinze-Vingts National Eye Hospital|''Quinze Vingts'']] near the [[Bastille]]. There were a few large enterprises, including the dye factory of Gobelins, next to the Bièvre river, which made scarlet dye for the Gobelin royal tapestry workshop, the oldest factory in the city, founded at the end of the 17th century; the royal manufactory of Sèvres, making porcelain; the royal mirror factory in the ''faubourg Saint-Antoine'', which employed a thousand workers; and the factory of [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon|Réveillon]] on ''rue de Montreuil'', which made painted wallpaper. There were a handful of pioneering large-scale enterprises at the edge of the city; the Antony candle factory and a large factory making printed cotton fabrics, directed by the German-born [[Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf]] at [[Jouy-en-Josas]], ten miles from the center of the city. Opened in 1762, this plant was one of the most modern factories in Europe; at its peak in 1774, it employed two thousand workers and produced sixty four thousand pieces of fabric.{{sfn|Le Roux|2013|page=9}}

In the second half of the 18th century, new scientific discoveries and new technologies changed the scale of Paris industry. Between 1778 and 1782, large steam engines were installed at [[16th arrondissement of Paris|Chaillot]] and ''Gros-Caillou'' to pump drinking water from the Seine. Major changes took place between 1770 and 1790 in chemical manufacturing, due to the pioneering work of French chemists. The first chemical factories were built between 1770 and 1779, based on the work of [[Lavoisier]], an innovative chemist who was head of the laboratory of the Paris Arsenal and was also the head of the royal administration for making gunpowder. He modernized the production of [[saltpeter]], the main ingredient of black powder, in large factories around Paris. The French chemist [[Berthollet]] discovered [[chlorine]] in 1785, creating a new industry for the manufacture of [[potassium chloride]].{{sfn|Le Roux|2013|page=18}}{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|page=99}}

New discoveries about acids, used extensively in fabric dyeing and metallurgy, led to the creation of new industries in Paris; the first French plant to manufacture [[sulfuric acid]] was opened in 1779. It was owned by the brother of king [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], the [[Charles X of France|Count of Artois]]; the King himself promoted it, eager that France complete successfully with England in industrial manufacturing. The chemical factory at ''Javel'' branched out to make other chemical products, including [[chlorine]] and [[hydrogen]] gas; the hydrogen made possible the first manned balloon flights by the [[Montgolfier Brothers]] shortly before the Revolution.{{sfn|Le Roux|2013|page=18}}

==Institutions==

===The city administration===
[[File:Nicolas-Jean-Baptiste Raguenet, Place de Grève.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Hôtel de Ville in 1753]]
From the beginning of the 18th century until the Revolution, Paris was governed by a multitude of royal Lieutenants, provosts and other officers whose positions had been created over the centuries, many of which were purely ceremonial, and none of whom had complete power over the city. The provost of the merchants, once a powerful position, had become purely ceremonial, and was named by the King. The corporations of the different professions had formerly governed Paris commerce; but after 1563, they were replaced by a system of royal commercial judges, the future commercial tribunals. The oldest and last Paris corporation, that of the river merchants, lost its rights and powers in 1672. Beginning in 1681, all the senior officials of the city, including the Provost of Paris and Governor of Paris, were nobles named by the King. The Provost and ''Echevins'' of Paris had prestige; formal costumes, carriages, banquets and official portraits, but little if any power. The position of Lieutenant General of Police, who served under the King and had his office at the fortress of Châtelet, was created in 1647. He did have some real authority; he was in charge of maintaining public order, and was also in charge of controlling weights and measures, and cleaning and lighting the streets.

With the Revolution, the city administration suddenly found itself without a royal master. On 15 July 1789, immediately after the fall of the Bastille, the astronomer Bailly was proclaimed the first modern Mayor of Paris. The old city government was abolished on 15 August, and a new municipal assembly created, with three hundred members, five from each of sixty Paris districts. On 21 May 1790, the National Assembly reorganized the city government, replacing the sixty districts with forty-eight sections. each governed by sixteen ''commissaires'' and a ''comissiaire'' of police. Each section had its own committees responsible for charity, armament, and surveillance of the citizens. The Mayor was elected for two years, and was supported by sixteen administrators overseeing five departments, including the police, finances, public works, public establishments, public works, and food supplies. The Municipal Council had thirty-two elected members. Above this was the Council General of the Commune, composed the Mayor, the Municipal Council, the city administrators, and ninety six notables, which met only to discuss the most important issues. This system was too complex and meetings were regularly disrupted by the representatives of the more radical sections.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=319-320}}

On August 10, 1792, on the same day that the members of the more radical political clubs and the ''sans-culottes'' stormed the Tuileries Palace, they also took over the Hotel de Ville, expelling the elected government and an Insurrectionary Commune. New elections by secret ballot gave the insurrectionary Commune only a minority of the Council. The more radical revolutionaries succeeded in invalidating the elections of their rivals, and took complete control of Commune. Robespierre, leading the Convention and its Committee on Public Safety, distrusted the new Commune and placed it under strict surveillance. On 17 September 1793, Robespierre put the city government under the authority of the Convention and the Committee of Public Safety. In March 1794, Robespierre had his opponents in the city government arrested and sent to the guillotine, and replaced by his own supporters. When the Convention finally turned upon Robespierre on 28 July 1794, he took sanctuary with his supporters in the City Hall, but was arrested and guillotined the same day.{{sfn|Fierro|pages=319-320}}

The new government, the Directory, had no desire to see another rival government appear in the Hôtel-de-Ville. On 11 October 1795, the Directory changed the status of Paris from an independent department to a canton of the Department of the Seine. The post of mayor was abolished, and the city was henceforth governed by the five administrators of the Department of the Seine. The city was divided into twelve municipalities subordinate to the government of the Department. Each municipality was governed by seven administrators named by the heads of the Department. Paris did not have its own elected Mayor again until 1977.{{sfn|Fierro|pages=319-321}}

===The police===
[[File:Étienne Jeaurat 001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The policemen of the ''Guet'', in blue uniforms, transport a cartload of prostitutes to the hospital-prison of Salpêtrière (1745)]] 
At the beginning of the 18th century, security was provided by two different corps of police; the ''Garde de Paris'' and the ''Guet Royal'', or royal watchmen. Both organizations were under the command of the Lieutenant General of Police. The ''Garde'' had one hundred twenty horsemen and four hundred archers, and was more of a military unit. The ''Guet'' was composed of 4 lieutenants, 139 archers, including 39 on horseback, and four drummers. The sergeants of the ''Guet'' wore a blue ''justaucorps'' or tight-fitting jacket with silver lace, a white plume on their hat, and red stockings, while ordinary soldiers of the guard wore a gray jacket with brass buttons and red facing on their sleeve, a white plume on their hat and a bandolier. 1750 there were nineteen posts of the ''Guet'' around the city, each the manned by twelve guards.

The members of the ''Guet'' were part of the local neighborhood, and were almost all Parisians; they were known for taking bribes and buying their commissions. The members of the ''Garde'' were mostly former army soldiers from the provinces, with little attachment to Paris. They were headquartered in the quarter Saint-Martin, and were more efficient and reliable supporters of the royal government, responsible for putting down riots in 1709 and 1725. In 1771 the ''Guet'' was formally placed under the command of the ''Garde'', and was gradually integrated into its organization. The responsibilities of the ''Garde'' were far-ranging, from chasing criminals to monitoring bread prices, keeping traffic moving on the streets, settling disputes and maintaining public order.

The Parisians considered the police both corrupt and inefficient, and relations between the people and the police were increasingly strained. When the Revolution began, the ''Garde'' harshly repressed the first riots of 1788-89, but, submerged in the neighborhoods of Paris, it was quickly infected by revolutionary ideas. On 13 October 1789, the ''Garde'' was formally attached to the ''Garde Nationale.'' It was reformed into the ''Legion de Police Parisienne'' on 27 June 1795, but its members mutinied on 28 April 1796, when it was proposed that they become part of the Army. The ''Garde'' was finally abolished on 2 May 1796. Paris did not have its own police force again until 4 October 1802, when Napoleon created the ''Garde Municipale de Paris'', under military command.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=915-917}}

===The hospitals===
For most of the 18th century, the hospitals were religious institutions, run by the church, which provided more spiritual than actual medical care. The largest and oldest was the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu]], located on the parvis of Notre-Dame Cathedral on the opposite side of the square from its present location. It was founded in 651 by Saint [[Landry of Paris]]. Its original buildings were entirely destroyed in the course of three fires in the 18th century, in 1718, 1737 and 1772. It was staffed by members of religious orders, and welcomed the destitute as well as the sick. Despite having two, three or even four patients per bed, it was always overflowing with the sick and poor of the city. The city had many smaller hospitals run by religious orders, some dating to Middle Ages; and there were also many specialized hospitals; for former soldiers at [[Les Invalides]]; for the contagious at La Sanitat de Saint-Marcel, or La Santé; a hospital for abandoned children, called ''Les Enfants Trouvés''; a hospital for persons with sexually transmitted diseases, in a former convent on boulevard Port Royal, founded in 1784; and a hospital for orphans founded by the wealthy industrialist Beaujon, opened in 1785 on the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Some hospitals served as prisons, where beggars were confined; these included the hospital of La Pitié, and La Salpêtrie, an enormous prison-hospital reserved for women, particularly prostitutes. In 1793, during the course of the Revolution, the royal convent of [[Val-de-Grâce]] was closed and was turned into a military hospital, and in 1795, the abbey of Saint-Antoine, in the Saint-Antoine quarter, was also converted into a hospital.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=931-935}}

Women giving birth at Hotel-Dieu and other hospitals were almost always poor and often wanted to hide their pregnancy; they were literally confined, unable to leave, and were not allowed to have visitors. They wore bed clothes with blue markings so they could be spotted if they tried to leave without authorization. They slept in large beds for four persons each. In 1795, the first maternity hospital in Paris was opened at Port-Royal, which eventually also included a school for training midwives.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=976-977}}

As the practice of vaccination was introduced and showed its effectiveness, patients began to have more confidence in medical healing. In 1781, the responsibility for medical care was formally transferred from church authority to the medical profession; patients were no longer admitted to the Hôtel-Dieu except for medical treatment, and doctors insisted that the medical treatment be scientific, not just spiritual.{{sfn|Garrioch|2015|page=204}}

===Prisons and the debut of the guillotine===
[[File:Bastille 1715.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Bastille in 1715]]
Paris possessed an extraordinary number and variety of prisons, used for different classes of persons and types of crimes. The fortress of the [[Place du Châtelet|Châtelet]] was the oldest royal prison, where the office of the Provost of Paris was also located. It had about fifteen large cells; the better cells were on the upper levels, where prisoners could pay a high pension to be comfortable and well-fed, while the lower cells, called de la Fosse, de la Gourdaine, du Puits and de l'Oubliette, were extremely damp and barely lit by the sun coming through a grate at street level. The [[Bastille]] and the [[Château de Vincennes]] were both used for high-ranking political prisoners, and had relatively luxurious conditions. The last three prisoners at the Chateau de Vincennes, the [[Marquis de Sade]] and two elderly and insane noblemen, were transferred to the Bastillle in 1784. The Bastille, begun in 1370, never held more than forty inmates; At the time of the Revolution, the Bastille had just seven prisoners; four counterfeiters, the two elderly noblemen, and a man named Tavernier, half-mad, accused of participation in an attempt to kill Louis XV thirty years earlier. Priests and other religious figures who committed crimes or other offenses were tried by church courts, and each priory and abbey had its own small prison. That of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pres]] was located at 166 boulevard Saint-Germain, and was a square building fifteen meters in diameter, with floors of small cells as deep as ten meters underground. The Abbey prison became a military prison under Louis XIV; in September 1792, it was the scene of a terrible massacre of prisoners, the prelude to the [[Reign of Terror]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1109-1111}}

Two large prisons which also served as hospitals had been established under Louis XIV largely to hold the growing numbers of beggars and the indigent; La Salpêtrière, which held two to three hundred condemned women, largely prostitutes; and Bicêtre, which held five prisoners at the time of the Revolution. Conditions within were notoriously harsh, and there were several mutinies by prisoners there in the 18th century. La Salpêtrière was closed in 1794, and the prisoners moved to a new prison of Saint-Lazare.

[[File:Tour du Temple circa 1795 Ecole Francaise 18th century.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The tower of the Temple, where the royal family were held prisoner, in 1795]]
For-l'Evêque on the quai Mégesserie, built in 1222, held prisoners guilty of more serious crimes; it was only 35 meters by nine meters in size, built for two hundred prisoners, but by the time of the Revolution it held as many as five hundred prisoners. It was finally demolished in 1783, and replaced by a new prison, created in 1780 by the transformation of the large town house of the family of La Force on rue de Roi-de-Sicilie, which became known as Grande Force. A smaller prison, called la Petite Force, was opened in 1785 nearby at 22 rue Pavée. A separate prison was created for those prisoners who had been sentenced to the galleys; they were held in the château de la Tournelle at 1 quai de la Tournelle; twice a year these prisoners were transported out of Paris to the ports to serve their sentences on the galleys.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1109-1111}}

In addition to the royal and ecclesiastical prisons, there were also a number of privately owned prisons, some for those who were unable to pay debts, and some, called ''masons de correction'', for parents who wanted to discipline their children; the young future revolutionary [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] was imprisoned by his mother in one of these for running away and stealing the family silverware.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1112}}

During the Reign of Terror of 1793 and 1794, all the prisons were filled, and additional space was needed to hold accused aristocrats and counter-revolutionaries. The King and his family were imprisoned within the tower of the Temple. The Luxembourg Palace and the former convents of Les Carmes (70 rue Vaugirard) and Port-Royal (121-125 boulevard Port-Royal) were turned into prisons. The [[Conciergerie]] within the Palace of Justice was used to hold accused criminals during their trial; Marie-Antoinette was held there until her sentence and execution.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1112}}

In the first half of the 18th century, under the Old Regime, criminals could be executed either by hanging, decapitation, burning alive, boiling alive, being broken on a wheel, or by drawing and quartering. The domestic servant [[Robert-François Damiens]], who tried to kill King Louis XV, was executed in 1757 by [[drawing and quartering]], the traditional punishment for [[regicide]]. His punishment lasted an hour before he died. the last man in France to suffer that penalty. Among the last persons to be hung in Paris was the Marquis de Favras, who was hung on the Place de Greve for attempting help Louis XVI in his unsuccessful flight from Paris.
[[File:Exécution de Marie Antoinette le 16 octobre 1793.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The execution by the guillotine of Marie Antoinette on 16 October 1793]]
In October 1789 Doctor [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], in the interest of finding a more humane method, successfully had the means of execution changed to decapitation by a machine he perfected, the [[guillotine]], built with the help of a Paris manufacturer of pianos and harps named Tobias Schmidt and the surgeon Antoine Louis. The first person to be executed with the guillotine was the thief Nicholas Jacques Pelletier, on 25 April 1792. After the uprising of the sans-culottes and the fall of the monarchy on August 10, 1792, the guillotine was turned against alleged counter-revolutionaries; the first to be executed by the guillotine was Collenot d'Angremont, accused of defending the Tuilleries Palace against the attack of the sans-culottes; he was executed on 21 August 1792 on the place du Carousel, next to the Tuileries Palace. The King was executed on the Place de la Concorde, renamed the Place de la Revolution, on 21 January 1793. From that date until 7 June 1794, 1,221 persons, or about three a day, were guillotined on the Place de la Revolution, including Queen Marie-Antoinette on 16 October 1793. In 1794, for reasons of hygiene, the Convention had the guillotine moved to the place Saint-Antoine, now the rue de la Bastille, near the site of the old fortress; seventy-three heads were cut off in just three days. In June 1793, again for reasons of avoiding epidemics, it was moved to the Place du Tron-Renversé (the Place of the Overturned Throne, now [[Place de la Nation]]). There, at the height of the Reign of Terror, between 11 June and 27 July, 1,376 persons were beheaded, or about thirty a day. After the execution of Robespierre himself, the reign of terror came to an end. The guillotine was moved to the Place de Grève, and was used only for the execution of common criminals.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=917-918}}

===The University and ''Grandes écoles''===
The [[University of Paris]] had fallen gradually in quality and influence since the 17th century. It was primarily a school of theology, not well adapted to the modern world, and played no important role in the scientific revolution or the Enlightenment. The school of law taught only religious law, and the medical school had little prestige, since doctors, until the mid-18th century, were considered in the same professional category as barbers. The university shrank from about sixty colleges in the early 17th century to thirty-nine in 1700. In 1763 the twenty-nine smallest colleges were grouped together in the college Louis-le-Grand, but altogether it had only 193 students. On 5 April 1792, without any loud protest, the University was closed.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=403-404}} Following its closing, the chapel of the Sorbonne was stripped for its furnishings and the head of its founder, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], was cut out of the famous portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]]. The building of the College de Cluny on Place Sorbonne was sold; the College de Sens became a boarding house, the College Lemoine was advertised as suitable for shops; the College d'Harcourt was half-demolished and the other half turned into workshops for tanners and locksmiths, and the College Saint-Barbe became a workshop for mechanical engineers.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=20-21.}} The University was not re-established until 1808, under Napoleon, with the name ''Université imperial''.

While the University vanished, new military science and engineering teaching schools flourished during the Revolution, as the revolutionary government sought to create a highly centralized and secular education system, centered in Paris. Some of the schools had been founded before the Revolution; the [[École des ponts ParisTech|School of bridges and highways]], France's first engineering school, was founded in 1747. The [[École Militaire]] was founded in 1750 to give an academic education to the sons of poor nobles; its most famous graduate was Napoleon Bonaparte in 1785; he completed the two-year course in just one year. The [[Ecole Polytechnique]] was founded in 1794, and became a military academy under Napoleon in 1804. The [[École Normale Supérieure]] was founded in 1794 to train teachers; it had some of France's best scientists on its faculty. These so-called ''[[Grandes écoles]]'' trained engineers and teachers who launched the French industrial revolution in the 19th century.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page 404}}

===Religions and the Freemasons===
The great majority of Parisians were at least nominally Roman Catholic, and the church played an enormous role in the life of the city; though its influence declined toward the end of the century, partly because of the Enlightenment, and partly from conflicts within the church establishment. The church, along with the nobility, suffered more than any other institutions from the French Revolution.

For most of the 18th century, until the Revolution, the church ran the hospitals and provided the health care in the city; was responsible for aiding the poor, and ran all the educational establishments, from the parish schools through the University of Paris. The nobility and the higher levels of the church were closely linked; the archbishops, bishops and other high figures of the church came from noble families, promoted their relatives, lived with ostentatious luxury, did not always live highly moral lives. [[Talleyrand]], though a bishop, never bothered to hide his mistress, and was much more involved in politics than religious affairs. At the beginning of the century the ''Confreries'', corporations of the members of each of the different Paris professions, were very active in each parish at the beginning of the century, organizing, events and managing the finances of the local churches, but their importance declined over the century, as the nobility, rather than the merchants, took over management of the church. 
{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=352}}

The church in Paris also suffered from internal tensions. In the 17th century, as part of the [[Counter-Reformation]], forty-eight religious orders, including the Dominicans, Franciscans, Jacobins, Capucines, Jesuits and many others, had established monasteries and convents in Paris. These establishments reported to the Pope in Rome rather than to the Archbishop of Paris, which soon caused trouble. The leaders of the Sorbonne chose to support the leadership of the archbishop rather than the Pope, so the Jesuits established their own college, Clermont, within the University of Paris, and constructed their own church, Saint-Louis, on the rue Saint-Antoine. The conflicts continued; The Jesuits refused to grant absolution to [[Madame de Pompadour]], mistress of the King, because she was not married to him, 1763 and 1764 the King closed the Jesuit colleges and expelled the order from the city.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=352}}

[[File:Église Saint-Sulpice de Paris, 2012.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The unfinished south tower of the church of Saint-Sulpice, left as it was in 1789.]] 
The Enlightenment also caused growing difficulties, as Voltaire and other ''Philosophes'' argued against unquestioned acceptance of the doctrines of the church. Paris became a battleground between the established church and the largely upper-class followers of a sect called [[Jansenism]], founded in Paris in 1623, and fiercely persecuted by both Louis XIV and the Pope. The archbishop of Paris required that dying persons sign a document renouncing Jansenism; if they refused to sign, they were denied last rites from the church. There were rebellions over smaller matters as well; in 1765 twenty-eight Benedictine monks petitioned the King to postpone the hour of first prayers so they could sleep longer, and to have the right to wear more attractive robes. The church in Paris also had great difficulty recruiting new priests among the Parisians; of 870 priests ordained in Paris between 1778 and 1789, only one-third were born in the city.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=357}}

The Catholic diocese of Paris also was having financial problems late in the century. It was unable to pay for the completion of the south tower of the [[church of Saint-Sulpice]]. though the north tower was rebuilt between 1770 and 1780; the unfinished tower is still as it was in 1789. unable to finish it to complete the churches of Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Sauveur. Four old churches, falling into ruins, were torn down and not replaced because of lack of funds.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=357}}

After the fall of the Bastille, the new National Assembly argued that the belongings of the church belonged to the nation, and ordered that church property be sold to pay the debts incurred by the monarchy. Convents and monasteries were ordered closed, and their buildings and furnishings sold as national property. Priests were no longer permitted to take vows; instead, they were required to take an oath of fidelity to the nation. Twenty-five of fifty Paris curates agreed to take the oath, along with thirty-three of sixty-nine vicars, a higher proportion than in other parts of France. Conflicts broke out in front of churches, where many parishioners refused to accept the priests who had taken the oath to the government. As the war began against Austria and Prussia, the government hardened its line against the priests who refused to take the oath. They were suspected of being spies, and a law was passed on 27 May 1792 calling for their deportation. large numbers of these priests were arrested and imprisoned; in September 1792 more than two hundred priests were taken from the jails and massacred.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=358}}

During the Reign of Terror, the anti-religious campaign intensified. All priests, including those who had signed the oath, were ordered to sign a declaration giving up the priesthood. One third of the four hundred priests remaining renounced their profession. On 23 November 1793, all the churches in Paris were closed, or transformed into &quot;temples of reason&quot;. Civil divorce was made simple, and 1,663 divorces were granted in the first nine months of 1793, along with 5,004 civil marriages. A new law on 6 December 1793 permitted religious services in private, but in practice the local revolutionary government arrested or dispersed anyone who tried to celebrate mass in a home.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=359}}

After the execution of Robespierre, the remaining clerics in prison were nearly all released, but the Convention and Directory continued to be hostile to the church. On 18 September 1794, they declared that the state recognized no religion, and therefore cancelled salaries they had been paying to the priests who had taken an oath of loyalty to the government.and outlawed the practice of allowing government-owned buildings for worship. On 21 February, the Directory recognized the liberty of worship, but outlawed any religious symbols on the exterior of buildings, prohibited wearing religious garb in public, and prohibited the use of government-owned buildings, including churches, for worship. On May 30, 1795, the rules were softened slightly and the church was allowed the use of twelve churches, one per arrondissement; the churches opened included the Cathedral of Notre Dame, Saint-Roche, Saint-Sulpice and Saint-Eustache. The number of recognized priests who had taken the oath the government fell from six hundred in 1791 to one hundred fifty in 1796, to seventy-five in 1800, In addition, there were about three hundred priests who had not taken the oath secretly conducting religious services. The Catholic Church was required to share the use of Notre-Dame, Saint-Sulpice and Saint-Roche with two new secular religions based on reason that had been created in the spirit of the Revolution; The church of Theophilanthropy and the Church of the Decadaire, the latter named for the ten-month revolutionary calendar.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=360}}

The Protestant Church had been strictly controlled and limited by the royal government for most of the 18th century. Only one church building was allowed, at Charenton, far from the center of the city, six kilometers from the Bastille. There were an estimated 8,500 Protestants in Paris in 1680, both Calvinists and Lutherans, or about two percent of the population. At Charenton, an act of religious tolerance was adopted by the royal government in November 1787, but it was opposed by the Catholic Church and the Parlement of Paris, and never put into effect. After the Revolution, the new Mayor, Bailly, authorized Protestants to use the church of Saint-Louis-Saint-Thomas, next to the Louvre.

The Jewish community in Paris was also very small; an estimated five hundred persons in 1789. About fifty were Sephardic Jews who had originally come from Spain and Portugal, then lived in Bayonne before coming to Paris. They lived mostly in the neighborhood of Saint-German-des-Prés, and worked largely in the silk and chocolate-making businesses. There was another Sephardic community of about one hundred persons in the same neighborhood, who were originally from Avignon, from the oldest Jewish community in France, which had lived protected in the Papal state. They mostly worked in commerce. The third and largest community, about three hundred fifty persons, were Ashkenaze Jews from Alsace, Lorraine, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. They spoke Yiddish, and lived largely in the neighborhood of the Church of Saint-Merri. They included three bankers, several silk merchants and jewelers, second-hand clothing dealers, and a large number of persons in the hardware business. They were granted citizenship after the French Revolution on 27 April 1791, but their religious institutions were not recognized by the French State until 1808.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=380}}

The Freemasons were not a religious community, but functioned like one and had a powerful impact on events in Paris in the 18th century. The first lodge in France, the ''Grand Loge de France'', was founded on 24 June 1738 on the rue des Boucheries, and was led by the Duke of Antin. By 1743 there were sixteen lodges in Paris, and their grand master was the Count of Clermont, close to the royal family. The lodges contained aristocrats, the wealthy, church leaders and scientists. Their doctrines promoted liberty and tolerance, and they were strong supporters of the Enlightenment; Beginning in 1737, the freemasons funded the publication of the first ''Encylopedie'' of Diderot, by a subscription of ten Louis per member per year. By 1771 there were eleven lodges in Paris. The Duke of Chartres, eldest son of the Duke of Orleans and owner of the Palais-Royal, became the new grand master; the masons began meeting regularly in cafes, and then in the political clubs, and they played an important part is circulating news and new ideas. The Freemasons were particularly hard-hit by the Terror; the aristocratic members were forced to emigrate, and seventy freemasons were sent to guillotine in the first our months of 1794.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=384}}

==Daily Life==

===Housing===
During the 18th century, the houses of the wealthy grew in size, as the majority of the nobility moved from the center or the Marais to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Faubourg Saint-German or to the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, where land was available and less expensive. Large town houses in the Marais averaged about a thousand square meters, those in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine in the 18th century averaged more than two thousand square meters, although some mansions in the Marais were still considered very large, like the [[Hôtel de Soubise|Hotel de Soubise]], the [[Hôtel de Sully|Hotel de Sully]], and the [[Carnavalet Museum|Hotel Carnavalet]], which is now a museum. The Hotel Matignon in the Faubourg Saint-Germain (now the residence and office of the Prime Minister), built in 1721, occupied 4,800 square meters, including its buildings and courtyards, plus a garden of 18,900 square meters.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=510}}

In the center of the city, a typical residential building, following the codes instituted under Louis XIV, occupied about 120 square meters, and had a single level of basement or cellar. On the ground floor, there were usually two shops facing the street, each with an apartment behind it where the owner lived. A corridor led from the small front entrance to a stairway to the upper floors, then to a small courtyard behind the building. Above the ground floor there were three residential floors, each with four rooms for lodging, while the top floor, under the roof, had five rooms. Only about eight percent of the typical building was made of wood, the rest usually being made of white limestone from Arcueil, Vaugirard or Meudon, and plaster from the gypsum mines under Montmartre and around the city.

Seventy-one percent of Paris residences had three rooms or less, usually a salon, a bedroom and a kitchen, the salon also serving as a dining room. But forty-five percent of residences did not have a separate kitchen; meals were prepared in the salon or bedroom. In the second half of the century, only 6.5 percent of apartments had a toilet or a bath.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=510}}

===Time, the work day and the daily meals===
In the 18th century, the time of day or night in Paris was largely announced by the church bells; in 1789 there were 66 churches, 92 chapels, 13 abbeys and 199 convents, all of which rang their bells for regular services and prayers; sometimes a little early, sometimes a little late. A clock had also been installed in a tower of the palace on the Île de la Cité by Charles V in about 1370, and it also sounded the hour. Wealthy and noble Parisians began to have pocket watches, and needed a way to accurately set the time, so sundials appeared around the city. The best known-sundial was in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. In 1750, the Duke of Chartres had a cannon installed there which, following the sundial, was fired precisely at noon each day.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=926}}

The day of upper-class Parisians before the Revolution was described in the early 1780s by Sebastien Mercier in his ''Tableau de Paris''. Deliveries of fresh produce by some three thousand farmers to the central market of Les Halles began at one in the morning, followed by the deliveries of fish and meat. At nine o'clock, the ''limonadiers'' served coffee and pastries to the first clients. At ten o'clock, the clerks and officials of the courts and administration arrived at work. At noon, the financiers, brokers and bankers took their places at the Bourse and in the financial district of the Saint-Honoré quarter. At two o'clock, work stopped in the financial markets and offices, and the Parisians departed for lunch, either at home or in restaurants. At five o'clock, the streets were again filled with people, as the wealthier Parisians went to the theater, or for promenades, or to cafés. The city was quiet until nine clock, when the streets filled again, as the Parisians made visits to friends. Dinner, or &quot;souper&quot; began between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock. It was also the hour when the prostitutes came out at the Palais-Royal and other heavily frequented streets. When the ''souper'' was finished, between eleven and midnight, most Parisians headed home, with others remained to gamble in the salons of the Palais-Royal.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=928-929}} The work day for artisans and laborers was usually twelve hours, from about seven in the morning until seven in the evening, usually with a two-hour break at midday for rest and food.

The Revolution, and the disappearance of the aristocracy, completely changed the dining schedule of the Parisians, with all meals taking place earlier. In 1800 few Parisians had a late ''souper''; instead they had their evening meal, or ''dîner'', served between five and six instead of at ten or eleven, and the afternoon meal, formerly called ''dîner'', was moved up to be served at about noon, and was called ''dejeuner''.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1135}}|

===Food and drink===
[[File:Études prises dans le bas peuple ou les Cris de Paris - Garçon Boulanger.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A baker's boy carrying loaves of bread (1737)]]
The basic diet of Parisians in the 18th century was bread, meat and wine. The bread was usually white bread, with a thick crust, good for dipping or soaking up a meat broth. `For the poor, bread was often the only staple of their diet; The Lieutenant-General of Police, from 1776 to 1785, Jean Lenoir, wrote: &quot;for a large part of the population, the only nourishment is bread, vegetables and cheese.&quot; The government was well aware of the political dangers of a bread shortage, and closely regulated the supply, the price and the bakeries, but the system broke down in 1789, with disastrous results.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1041-42}}

[[File:Études prises dans le bas peuple ou les Cris de Paris - La Vie, La Vie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A street vendor selling [[eau-de-vie]] brandy (1737)]]
According to a contemporary study by the Enlightenment-era chemist Lavoisier, Parisians spent about twice as much on meat as they did on bread, which accounted for only about thirteen percent of their food budget. Butcher shops all around the city provided the meat; the animals were slaughtered in the courtyards behind the shops, and the blood often flowed out into the streets. The better cuts of meat went to aristocracy and the merchant class; poorer Parisians ate mutton and pork, sausages, andouilles, brains, tripe, salted pork, other inexpensive cuts. The uneaten meat from the tables of the upper class was carefully collected and sold by ''regrattiers'' who specialized in this trade.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1190-91}}

Wine was the third basic component of the Parisian meal. Wealthier Parisians consumed wines brought from Bordeaux and Burgundy; the Parisian middle class and workers drank wines from regions all over France, usually brought in barrels by boat or by road. In 1725 there were an estimated 1,500 wine merchants in Paris. The royal government profited from the flood of wine coming to Paris by raising taxes, until wine was the most highly taxed product coming into the city in 1668, each barrel of wine barrel of wine entering Paris by land was taxed 15 livres, and 18 livres if it arrived by boat. By 1768 the government raised the taxes to 48 livres by land and 52 by water. To avoid the taxes, hundreds of taverns called guinguettes sprang up just outside the tax barriers on the edges of the city, at Belleville, Charonne, and new shanty-towns called La Petite-Pologne, Les Porcherons, and La Nouvelle-France. A pint of wine sold in these taverns was taxed 3.5 sous a pint, while the same amount was taxed 12 to 15 sous inside Paris. The tax was hated by the Parisians, and was an important cause of the growing hostility to the royal government before the Revolution.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1194}}

===Drinking water===
[[File:Études prises dans le bas peuple ou les Cris de Paris - Porteur d'eau.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Paris water-bearer (1737]]
For obtaining drinking water, wealthier Parisians usually had wells in their residences, often in the basement. For ordinary Parisians, it was much more difficult. The water of the Seine had been polluted since the Middle Ages by the discharge of human and animal waste, the dumping of chemicals by the tanneries, and by the decomposition of bodies in the many cemeteries not far from the river. In the 18th century the Lieutenant General of Police banned taking drinking water from between the present Quai des Celestins and the modern quai de Louvre. Average Parisians depended upon the fountains around city, which were not numerous, did not run at night, were crowded, and required a payment for each bucket taken. Parisians either collected water themselves, sent a servant, or depended upon water bearers, men who carried covered buckets of water or rolled large barrels on wheels to the residence and charged a fee for the service. There were frequent fights at public fountains between water bearers and domestic servants, and water bearers were known to avoid paying the fee at fountains by simply taking the water from the Seine. In the 18th century, a few enterprising Parisians dug [[Artesian wells]]; one well at the École Militaire sent a jet of water eight to ten meters into the air; but the artesian well water was hot and had a poor taste. In 1776 the Perrier brothers started a business delivering three million liters a water a day using steam-powered pumps at [[Chaillot]] and Gros-Caillou. Facing the organized hostility of the water bearers, the company went bankrupt in 1788 and was taken over by the city. The water supply problem was not resolved until the First Empire, when Napoleon commissioned a canal from the Ourcq River.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1122}}

===Transportation===
There was no public transportation in Paris in the 18th century; the only way for ordinary Parisians to move around the city was on foot, a difficult experience in the winding, crowded and narrow streets, especially in the rain or at night. The nobles and the wealthy traversed the city either on horseback or in chairs carried by servants. These chairs gradually were replaced by horse-drawn carriages, both private and for hire. By 1750, there were more than ten thousand carriages for hire in Paris, the first Paris taxis.&lt;ref&gt;Combeau, Yvan, ''History of Paris'', pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Bateaux-Lavoirs''===
The ''Bateaux-Lavoirs'' were large flat-bottomed barges, protected by wooden or straw roofs, which were moored at designated places along the Seine and used by laundresses to wash laundry in the river. The laundresses paid the owners a fee for the use of the boat. There were some eighty of them in 1714; groups of six, moored two by two, were anchored across from Notre Dame, near the Pont Saint-Michel, and near the rue de l'Hôtel-Colbert. They preferred to be on the right bank, so the sunshine could dry the laundry.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=708}}

===The floating baths===
In the 18th century only the nobility and wealthy had bathtubs in their homes, at the [[Le Marais|Marais]] and [[Faubourg Saint-Germain]], the fashionable districts of the time. Other Parisians either did not bathe at all, bathed with a bucket, or went to one of the public bath houses, which provided hot tubs of water for a fee. They were heavily taxed by the government, and only a dozen survived until the end of the century. The more popular alternative, especially in summer, was bathing in the river from one of the large flat-bottomed bathing barges which were moored along the Seine, particularly on the right bank between the [[Cours-la-Reine]] and the [[Pont Marie]]. They were mostly former lumber barges, which were covered with wooden or straw roofs. Bathers paid an admission charge, then went down wooden steps from the barge into the river. Wooden pilings marked the limits of the bathing area, there were ropes to the pilings for the assistance of the numerous bathers who couldn't swim. In 1770 there were twenty such bathing barges, located at the Cours-la-Reine, the quai du Louvre, the quai Conti, across from the Palais-Bourbon, and at the western end of the Île-de-la-Cité, an establishment opened by the Canons of Notre-Dame. There were separate barges for men and women, and the bathers were offered bathing costumes for rent, but many preferred to bathe nude, men frequently swam into the women's area or swam along the river in full view of the people on riverbank. In 1723 the Lieutenant-General of Police condemned the baths as an offense to public morality and urged that they be moved from the center of the city, but they were popular and remained. In 1783 the police finally restricted bathing in the river during the day, but bathing at night was still allowed.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=699}}

===The Press, the pamphlet and the Post===
[[File:Mercure de France, October 1749.png|thumb|right|200px|The ''Mercure de France'' issue of October 1749, dedicated to the King]]
The first daily newspaper in the city, the ''Journal de Paris'', began publication on 1 January 1777. It was four pages long, printed on small sheets of paper, and focused on local news, and what was allowed by the royal censors. The press did not emerge as a force in Parisian life until 1789 and the Revolution, when censorship was abolished. Serious publications, such as the ''Journal des Débats'' appeared, along with thousands of short pamphlets, addressing the current topics of the day, and often virulent in their language. The period of press freedom did not last for long; in 1792 Robespierre and the Jacobins restored censorship and closed opposition newspapers and printing houses. Strict censorship was retained by governments that followed. Freedom of the press was not restored until the second half of the 19th century.

Several weekly and monthly magazines appeared in the early 18th century; the ''[[Mercure de France]]'', originally called the ''Mercure Gallant'', had first been published as an annual journal in 1611. An advertisement for an essay contest in the magazine in 1749 inspired [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to write his first important essay, &quot;[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]&quot; which brought him to public attention. The ''Journal des Savants'', first published in 1665, circulated the news of new scientific discoveries. Near the end of the century, Paris journalists and printers produced a wide range of speciality publications, on fashion, for children, and on medicine, history, and science. In addition to the official publications of the Catholic church, there was a clandestine religious journal, the ''Nouvelles Eccléstiastiques'', first printed in 1728, which circulated the ideas of the [[Jansenists]], a sect denounced by the church. Through the journals, the ideas and discoveries made in Paris were circulated around France and across Europe.

In the beginning of the 18th century Paris had a very rudimentary postal service, which had been established in 1644 to carry letters by horseback couriers to other cities in France or abroad, but there was no postal service within the city itself; Parisians had to send a domestic or deliver the letter themselves. In 1758, a private company, called the ‘’Petite Poste’', was organized to deliver letters within the city, in imitation of the &quot;penny post&quot; in London. It began to function in 1760; a letter cost two sous, and there were three distributions a day. It was successful, with nine bureaus, with twenty to thirty mailmen per bureau, and five hundred mail boxes around the city. By 1787 there were two hundred mailmen making ten rounds of delivery each day{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1097-1098}}

==Amusements==

===Parks, promenades and pleasure gardens===
[[File:Philibert-Louis Debucourt - Promenade de la galerie du Palais-Royal.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A promenade in the Palais-Royal (1798)]]
One of the chief amusements of the Parisians was to promenade, to see and be seen in the gardens and public places. There were three gardens open to the public in the 18th century; the [[Tuileries Gardens]], the [[Luxembourg Garden]], under the windows of the royal palace; and the [[Jardin des Plantes]]. There was a no admission charge, and there were often concerts and other entertainment.

It was difficult to promenade in the narrow streets, crowded, without sidewalks and filled with wagons, carts, carriages and animals. At the beginning of the century Parisians preferred to promenade on the wide [[Pont Neuf]]. As the century advanced, they were attracted to the new boulevards, built on the site of the old city walls, and to the new Champs-Élysées, where the first large town houses were being constructed. As the boulevards attracted crowds, they also attracted street entertainers; acrobats, musicians, dancers, and every kind of trained animal performed on the sidewalks.

The end of the 18th century saw the opening of the pleasure gardens of Ranelegh, Vauxhall, and [[Jardin de Tivoli, Paris|Tivoli]]. These were large private gardens where, in summer, Parisians paid an admission charge and found food, music, dancing, and other entertainment, from pantomime to magic lantern shows and fireworks. The admission fee was relatively high; the owners of the gardens wanted to attract a more upper class clientele, and to keep out the more boisterous Parisians who thronged the boulevards. 
[[File:Carmontelle - Parc Monceau 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Parc Monceau]] in 1790]]

The most extravagant pleasure garden was [[Parc Monceau]], created by [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], which opened in 1779. it was designed for the Duke by the painter [[Carmontelle]]. It contained a miniature Egyptian pyramid, a Roman colonnade, antique statues, a pond of water lilies, a tatar tent, a farmhouse, a Dutch windmill, a temple of Mars, a minaret, an Italian vineyard, an enchanted grotto, and &quot;a gothic building serving as a chemistry laboratory,&quot; as described by Carmontelle. In addition to the follies, the garden featured servants dressed in oriental and other exotic costumes, and unusual animals, such as camels.{{sfn|Jarrassé|2007|page=76}} In 1781 parts of the garden were transformed into a more traditional [[English landscape garden]], but vestiges of the original follies, including the pyramid and colonnade, can still be seen.

By far the most popular destination for promenaders in the late 18th century was the [[Palais-Royal]], the most ambitious project of the Duke of Orléans. Between 1780 and 1784 he rebuilt his family gardens into a pleasure garden surrounded by wide covered arcades, which were occupied by shops, art galleries, and the first true restaurants in Paris. There was a pavilion in the gardens for horseback riding; The basements were occupied by popular cafes with drinks and musical entertainment, and the upper floors by rooms for card-playing and gambling. At night, the galleries and gardens became the most popular meeting place between prostitutes and their clients.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=116-117}}

===Bouillons and Restaurants===
For centuries, Paris had taverns which served food at large common tables, but they were notoriously crowded, noisy, not very clean, and served food of dubious quality. In about 1765 a new kind of eating establishment, called a &quot;Bouillon&quot;, was opened on rue des Poulies, near the Louvre, by a man named Boulanger. It had separate tables, a menu, and specialized in soups made with a base of meat and eggs, which were said to be &quot;restaurants&quot; or ways of restoring oneself. Dozens of bouillons soon appeared on Paris streets.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=136-137}}

The first luxury restaurant in Paris, called the Taverne Anglaise, was opened by [[Antoine Beauvilliers]], the former chef of the Count of Provence, at the Palais-Royal. It had mahogany tables, linen tablecloths, chandeliers, well-dressed and trained waiters, a long wine list and an extensive menu of elaborately prepared and presented dishes. A rival restaurant was started in 1791 by Méot, the former chef of the Duke of Orleans, by the end of the century there were other luxury restaurants at the Grand-Palais; : Huré, the Couvert espagnol; Février; the Grotte flamande; Véry, Masse and the cafe des Chartres (now the Grand Vefour).{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1137}}

===Cafés===
[[File:Cafe de Procope 1743.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Café de Procope in 1743]]
[[Coffee]] had been introduced to Paris in 1644, and the first café opened in 1672, but the institution did not become successful until the opening of [[Café Procope]] in about 1689 in rue des Fossés-Saint-Germain, close to the Comédie-Française, which had just moved to that location.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=742}} The café served coffee, tea, chocolate, liqueurs, ice cream and confiture in a luxurious setting. The ''Café Procope'' was frequented by Voltaire (when he was not in exile), Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Diderot and D’Alembert.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, ''Paris: Biography of a City'' (2004) pp. 188, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Cafés became important centers for exchanging news, rumors and ideas, often more reliable than the newspapers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton, &quot;An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' (2000) 105#1 pp 1–35 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2652433 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1723 there were about 323 cafés in Paris; by 1790 there were more than 1,800. They were places for meeting friends, and for literary and political discussion. As Hurtaut and Magny wrote in their ‘’Dictionnaire de Paris’’ in 1779: &quot;One gets the news there, either by conversation, or by reading the newspapers. You don’t have to encounter anyone with bad morals, no loud persons, no soldiers, no domestics, no one who could trouble the tranquility of society.&quot;{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=742}} Women rarely entered cafés, but women of the nobility sometimes stopped their carriages outside and were served inside the carriage with cups on silver platters. During the Revolution the cafés turned into centers of furious political discussion and activity, often led by members of the Revolutionary clubs.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=743}}

===The Guingette===
The ''Guingette'' was mentioned as early as 1723 in the ''Dictionaire du commerce'' of Savary. It was a type of tavern located just outside the city limits of Paris, where wine and other drinks were taxed less and were much cheaper. They were open Sundays and holidays, usually had musicians for dancing, and attracted large crowds of working-class Parisians eager for rest and recreation after the work week. As time went on, they also attracted middle class Parisians with their families.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=919}}

===Dancing—The Masked ball ===
[[File:Bal des gens de maison, rue du Mont-Blanc, par Claude-Louis Desrais.jpg|Thumb|right|300px|Ball for servants on rue du Mont-Blanc (1799)]]
Public balls were banned on moral grounds during the last years of the reign of Louis XIV, and were not permitted again until under the Regency. At this time a royal ordinance of 31 December 1715 authorized the first public balls in the city. These were the famous masked balls of the Paris Opera, which took place on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays beginning on the day of Saint Martin and continuing until Carnival.

==Culture==

===The Theater===
[[File:Foire saint-laurent.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The theater of Nicolet on the Boulevard du Temple (1760s)]]
Theater was an increasingly popular form of entertainment for the Parisians throughout the 18th century. The number of theater seats grew from about four thousand in 1700 to 13,000 in 1789.{{sfn|Garrioch|2015|page=251}} In 1760, the [[boulevard du Temple]] became the main theater street of Paris, with the opening by Nicolet of the ''Théâtre des Grands Danseurs de Roi'', which later became the ''Théâtre de la Gaîeté''. In 1770 the ''Ambigu-Comique'' opened on the same street, followed in 1784 by the ''Théâtre des Élèves de l'Opéra'', also known as the ''Lycée Dramatique''. In 1790 the ''Théâtre des Variétés amusantes'', originally located on rue de Bondy, moved to the same neighborhood, to the corner of the rue Richelieu and the Palais-Royal. In 1790. The boulevard du Temple and eventually took the name of the &quot;Boulevard du Crime&quot; because of all of the melodramas that played in the theaters there. Another new theater was opened in 1784 at the northwest corner of the Palais-Royal; it was used first by the company of the Count of the Beaujolais, then by the actress [[Mademoiselle Montansier]]. The [[Comédiens Italiens]] moved in 1783 to the Salle Favert. On the left bank, the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Odéon Theater]] opened in 1782.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1172-1173}}

The most successful Paris playwright was [[Pierre Beaumarchais]] who first put on stage the ''[[Le Barbier de Séville]]'' in 1775 in the [[Tuileries Palace]], performed by the [[Comédie Française]]. It was followed by ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|Le Mariage de Figaro]]'', which was accepted for production by the management of the [[Comédie Française]] in 1781, but at private reading before the French court the play so shocked King Louis XVI that he forbade its public presentation. Beaumarchais revised the text, moving the action from France to Spain, and, after more changes, it was finally allowed to be staged. It opened at the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Théâtre Français]] on 27 April 1784 and ran for 68 consecutive performances, earning the highest box-office receipts of any French play of the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Garrioch|2015|page=251}} 
[[File:Paris Comedie-Francaise.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A performance of the [[Comedie-Française]] in the late 18th century]]

The most famous of Paris theater companies, the Comédie-Francaise, was located since 1689 on the rue des Fossés-Saint-Germain-des-Prés (now 14 rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie). In 1770, because of the decrepitude of their old theater, they were forced to move to the hall of machines of the Tuileries Palace. The hall was too large and not adapted to their style of theater, so they moved back to the left bank to the Odéon Theater. With the arrival of the Revolution, the theater company split in two; the actors who were sympathetic to the monarchy remained in place, but on 3 September 1793, after a performance of a play called ''Paméla ou la Vertu récompensé'' by François de Neufchâteau, which the more radical [[Jacobins]] felt was counter-revolutionary, the theater was closed. The actors were arrested and barely escaped the guillotine. The actors who were more sympathetic to the Revolution, led by the actor [[François-Joseph Talma]], had installed themselves in a new theater next to the Palais-Royal, built by the architect [[Victor Louis]] between 1786 and 1790. They performed first under the name of the ''Théatre de la Liberté et de la Égalité'', then under the name ''Théatre de la Republique''; under the Consulate the scripts of their plays were carefully scrutinized by a ''Commissaire'' of the government, to assure they did not contain political messages. The political differences of the actors were eventually put aside, the two troupes rejoined into one company, and established themselves in the theater which is still the home of the Comédie-Française today.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=791-792}}

===Painting and sculpture===
[[File:Salon du Louvre 1787.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Paris Salon of 1787, by Pierre Antonio Martini]]
Paris produced two important painters at the beginning of the 18th century; [[Jean-Baptiste Chardin]] and [[François Boucher]]; and two more at the end of the century, [[Hubert Robert]] and [[Jacques Louis David]]. Other notable painters, including [[Maurice Quentin de la Tour]], [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], [[Joseph Vernet]] and [[Jean Honoré Fragonard]] came to Paris from the provinces and achieved success. The [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) had been founded under Louis XIV, and from 1667 until 1791 it organized the major artistic event, the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], held every two years. It opened on 25 August, the day of Saint Louis, in honor of the King, and lasted for several weeks. In the 18th century was held in the Salon Carré of the Louvre (which gave the Salon its name) and gradually expanded over the years to the Gallery of Apollo. At the 1761 Salon, thirty-three painters, nine sculptors, and eleven engravers contributed.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]]. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700-1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 3. ISBN 0300064942&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1791 it was limited to members of the Academy, and as many as five hundred paintings were shown at each Salon. On August 8, 1793, the Academy was suspended by the [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] [[National Convention]], which decreed the abolition of all the royal artistic and literary academies.

During the Revolution, Jacques Louis David, a friend of Robespierre and a member of the radical [[Jacobin]] club, became the unofficial minister of propaganda of the Revolution. He created a series of paintings associating the French Revolution with the virtues of the ancient Rome, and designing costumes and pageants for the Revolutionary government. After the fall of Robespierre, he was imprisoned, freed, and at the beginning of the 19th century was painting portraits of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].

===Literature===
[[File:Les salons au XVIIIe siècle - Histoire Image.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A reading of a work by Voltaire in the salon of Madame Geoffrin (1755)]]
Of the great French writers of the 18th century, the two most famous, [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], spent most of their careers far from Paris, either in exile or under strict censorship. Early in his career Voltaire had been welcomed to the salon of [[Madame Pompadour]], and had been granted a government pension, which he did not touch for twelve years; the scholar and co-author of the first Encyclopedia, [[d'Alembert]] had been provided an apartment in the Louvre; and Rousseau had been feted and welcomed to the homes of the nobility. But under Louis XVI the royal attitudes changed. Voltaire very rarely visited Paris between 1760 and his death in 1784. Rousseau was allowed to return to Paris from exile only on the condition that he not publish any of his work. Nonetheless, the writing of both men was widely read, usually in clandestine editions, and shaped the ideas that led to the Revolution.

In the first half of the 18th century, eminent French writers were invited to become members of the [[Académie Française]], but the Academy in practice served largely to glorify the royal family and to keep writers under gentle control, rather to stimulate innovation in literature. Neither Rousseau nor Voltaire were chosen; only one of the great [[Philosophes]] of the enlightenment, [[Montesquieu]], was elected a member. His 1748 book ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', proposing a separation of powers between the executive, legislature and courts, had an enormous impact on political thinking outside France, especially in England and the United States.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=664}}

Despite censorship and restrictions, Paris was the leading book-publishing center of Europe, and provided books not only to France, but exported them to all the courts and aristocracies of Europe, where French was widely spoken. The plays of Voltaire, [[Pierre Beaumarchais]] and [[Pierre de Marivaux]]; the novels of [[Choderlos de Laclos]] (''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]''), [[Antoine François Prévost]] (''[[Manon Lescaut]]'') and the poetry of [[Jacques Delille]] and [[Évariste de Parny]] were read in all the major cities of the continent, as far away as Saint Petersburg.

An important feature of the Paris literary world was the literary salon, where wives of the nobility invited their friends to their homes to hear readings of new books and to discuss literature, and, later in the century, politics. The first famous Paris salon of the 18th century was that of Madame de Lambert in her town house on rue Richelieu in 1710, followed by those of Madames de Tencin, Geoffrin, Du Deffand, d'Épinay, Helvétius, and Necker.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1151}} The Revolution brought an abrupt end to the literary salons, as the aristocrats were executed or forced into exile, and some of the most promising writers, including the poet [[André Chenier]], went to the guillotine.

==The Enlightenment==
[[File:Zoom lunette ardente.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] conducting an experiment related to combustion generated by amplified sun light (1770s)]]
In the mid-18th century, Paris became the center of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The philosophic movement was led by [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued for a society based upon reason rather than faith and Catholic dogma, and for a new civil order based on natural law, and for science based on experiments and observation. The political philosopher [[Montesquieu]] introduced the idea of a [[separation of powers]] in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution.

Much of the activity was based at the Louvre, where the [[French Academy of Sciences]], founded in 1666, was located; it had separate sections for geometry, astronomy, mechanics, anatomy, chemistry and botany. Under Louis XVI, the 18th century, new sections were added on physics, natural history and mineralogy. The biologist and natural historian [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] directed the [[Jardin des Plantes]], and made it a leading center for botanic research. The mathematicians [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], [[Jean-Charles de Borda]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]; the botanist [[René Louiche Desfontaines]], the chemists [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], all contributed to the new scientific revolution taking place in Paris.{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|pages=99–105}}

The new ideas and discoveries were publicized throughout Europe by the large number of book publishers in Paris. Between 1720 and 1780, the number of books about science and art doubled, while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total.{{sfn|Petitfils|2005|pages=99-105}} [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] published their ''[[Encyclopedie]]'' in seventeen volumes between 1751 and 1766. It provided intellectuals across Europe with a high quality survey of human knowledge. Scientists came to Paris from across Europe and from the United States to share ideas; [[Benjamin Franklin]] came in 1766 to meet with Voltaire and to talk about his experiments with electricity.

===Inventions===

[[File:First parachute2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A drawing of the first frameless parachute, tested by André-Jacques Garnerin above [[Parc Monceau]] on 22 October 1797.]]
The 18th century in Paris was a particularly inventive period. Some of the discoveries of Paris scientists, particularly in the field of chemistry, were quickly put to practical use; the experiments of Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris, and the production of [[hydrogen]] gas enabled the [[Montgolfier Brothers]] to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the [[Château de la Muette]], near the [[Bois de Boulogne]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''Histoire de Paris'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the balloon led directly to the invention of the [[parachute]]. [[André-Jacques Garnerin]], who had flown in a Montgolfier balloon in 1790, wanted to find a vehicle by which a pilot could abandon a balloon in case of an accident. On 22 October 1797 he made the first descent with a frameless silk parachute, dropping from a balloon seven hundred meters above [[Parc Monceau]]. On 10 November 1798 his future wife, Jeanne-Genevieve Labrousse, became the first woman to ascend alone in a balloon, and the first woman to make a parachute jump.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1046}}

A more modest but highly useful invention, the folding [[umbrella]], was introduced in 1710 by a Paris merchant named Jean Marius, with his shop at the barrier of Saint-Honoré. He obtained a monopoly on the manufacture of umbrellas which opened and closed like modern models, and weighed less than one kilogram. A model was purchased in 1712 by the Princess Palatine, who wrote about it to her friends and helped make it a popular fashion item. An important improvement was reported to the French Academy of Sciences in 1759; an umbrella combined with a cane, with a small button the side to open the umbrella.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1047}}

==Urbanism==
[[File:Hubert Robert - Demolition of the Houses on the Pont Notre-Dame in 1786 - WGA19597.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Demolition of houses on the Pont Notre-Dame, by [[Hubert Robert]] (1786)]]
Paris in the first half of the 18th century had some beautiful buildings, but it was not a beautiful city. The philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] described his disappointment when he first arrived in Paris in 1731: 
I expected a city as beautiful as it was grand, of an imposing appearance, where you saw only superb streets, and palaces of marble and gold. Instead, when I entered by the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, I saw only narrow, dirty and foul-smelling streets, and villainous black houses, with an air of unhealthiness; beggars, poverty; wagons-drivers, menders of old garments; and vendors of tea and old hats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Roche|title=The People of Paris: An Essay in Popular Culture in the 18th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ct-vURCb2BYC&amp;pg=PA10|year=1987|publisher=U. of California Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, in ''Embellissements de Paris'', [[Voltaire]] wrote: &quot;We blush with shame to see the public markets, set up in narrow streets, displaying their filth, spreading infection, and causing continual disorders… Immense neighborhoods need public places. The center of the city is dark, cramped, hideous, something from the time of the most shameful barbarism.&quot;{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=133}}

In the second half of the century, in keeping with the ides of the Enlightenment, the administration of Paris, particularly the police, made an effort to improve the way that the city looked and functioned. One example was the sidewalk; in mid-century sidewalks existed in London, but there were none in Paris. The first sidewalk in Paris was begun in 1781, along the new rue du Théâtre Française, now rue de l’Odéon, to protect the spectators going along the street to the new theater. The second sidewalk was begun in 1788 along rue Louvois, where another new theater was planned. The sidewalk was four feet wide (1.2 meters) and 10 to 12 inches (thirty centimeters) high, with a stone border. Before the end of the century, several more sidewalks were installed along new streets in the wealthy neighborhoods around the quarter of la Chaussée d'Antin.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1184}}

An effort had begun in the 17th century to regulate the height of Paris buildings, which had grown higher and higher, blocking all light to the narrow streets. An ordinance of 18 August 1667 limited the height of buildings to 15.6 meters, the first such limit in the city. Royal declarations in 1783 and 1784 set a limit on the height of buildings determined by the width of the street; For a street at least ten meters wide, the buildings along the street could not be more than twenty meters, or six stories, including the attic. For the narrower streets, less than 7.45 meters wide, the height of buildings was limited to 11.7 meters. The result was to give a uniform appearance and height to the new Paris streets.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=516}}

The city authorities, led by the Lieutenant General of Police, made the first serious efforts to improve traffic circulation in the congested streets of the city, by removing stones and barriers put in front of houses and by restricting the placement of the tables and carts of street merchants. They also tried to improve the bottleneck of traffic created on the ten existing bridges over the Seine. The houses which lined the Pont au Change were pulled down, and a project was launched in 1725 to build a new bridge to connect two of the city's most wealthy new neighborhoods, the Faubourg de rue Saint-Honoré on the right bank and the Faubourg Saint-Germain on the right bank. Construction on the new bridge did not begin until 1788; stones from the demolished Bastille were used to help finish the bridge, which was dedicated in 1791 as the Pont Louis XVI. It was renamed the pont de la Revolution in 1792; then, in 1795, [[pont de la Concorde (Paris)|Pont de la Concorde]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1088}}

An attempt was also made in the late 18th century to improve the quality of street lighting. In 1669, under Louis XIV, the city was already lit with three thousand oil lamps, suspended in the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet, with twenty feet between each lantern, but not every street was lit, and the light was usually very dim; those going out at night or to the theater were usually obliged to hire a lantern-bearer to light their way until the end of the century. Between 1745 and 1769, the old lanterns were gradually replaced by a new model called a ''réverbère'' which, mounted on a lamp post, gave off a much brighter light. By 1789 there were 5,694 new lanterns in service. A few years later the most popular revolutionary song, ''Ça ira!'' urged Parisians to hang aristocrats from the new lanterns.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=956}}

The predominant architectural style in Paris from the mid-17th century until the regime of [[Louis Philippe]] was neo-classicism, based on the model of Greco-Roman architecture; the most classical example was the new church of ''La Madeleine'', whose construction began in 1764. It was so widely used that it invited criticism: just before the Revolution the journalist [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] wrote: “How monotonous is the genius of our architects! How they live on copies, on eternal repetition! They don't know how to make the smallest building without columns… They all more or less resemble temples.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis-Sébastien Mercier|title=Paris: Including a Description of the Principal Edifices and Curiosities of that Metropolis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIceJv8ct40C&amp;pg=PA21|year=1817|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary Paris (1789–1799)==
{{Main|French Revolution}}
[[File:Lallemand - Arrestation du gouverneur de la Bastille - 1790.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The storming of the [[Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 marked the beginning of the French Revolution]]

===The eve of the Revolution===
Louis XVI had ascended the throne of France in 1774, and his new government in Versailles desperately needed money; the treasury had been drained by the [[Seven Years' War]] (1755–63) and the French intervention in the [[American Revolution]]. To establish better relations with Paris, in 1774 the King restored the historic ''Parlement'' of Paris, France's oldest and highest court of nobles. To save money, he abolished the two companies of musketeers of the Paris garrison, and reduced the number of ''Gardes Françaises'' in Paris from six to four battalions, and dismissed or demoted many of commanders. This significantly reduced the number of loyal soldiers and police available in Paris to defend the government.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=87}} Between 1784 and 1791, the frivolity of the Court and extravagant expenditures of Marie-Antoinette ruined the public sympathy she had initially enjoyed. Dozens of clandestine pamphlets began to circulate in Paris, condemning the immorality of the Queen and nobility.

The royal administration also quickly ruined its reputation with the Parisians. They decided to build a new wall around Paris, not to keep invaders out, but to stop the smuggling of goods into Paris past the tax collectors, merchandise coming into the city. The wall, called the [[Wall of the Farmers-General]], was twenty-five kilometers long, four to five meters high, and had fifty-six gates where taxes had to be paid. Portions of the wall can still be seen at ''[[Place Denfert-Rochereau]]'' and ''[[Place de la Nation]]'', and one of the toll gates in the [[Parc Monceau]]. The wall and the taxes were highly unpopular, and, along with shortages of bread, fueled the growing discontent.&lt;ref&gt;Combeau, Yvan, ''Histoire de Paris'', pp. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The King's finance minister, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], tried to reform the finances of the state, reducing state expenses and freeing the prices of grain from state control. Speculation on grain prices drove the price of bread up, leading to bread riots in Paris on 3 May 1775. After supporting Turgot, in 1776 the King dismissed him and refused to make any further major fiscal reforms. The King also lost much of his support within the army. In 1781, the minister of the Army, Ségur, decided that any candidate to be an army officer had to show four degrees of nobility, blocking any path of advancement for talented but non-noble officers. Even noble officers had to be rich enough to pay a large sum for their promotion. When the Revolution came, the non-noble and less-wealthy officers abandoned the King and joined the Revolutionaries. By August 1788, the government had run out of money, and gave soldiers and government workers and contractors notes promising to pay, rather than cash. Riots broke out, and customs posts all over Paris were attacked and burned. The King gave way and appointed the Swiss-born banker and reformist, [[Jacques Necker]], as his new finance minister.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=90}}
[[File:Folie-titon 10.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rioters attack the house of the first prominent Paris industrialist, [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]], on 28 April 1789]]
The economic crisis within Paris continued to worsen. A trade agreement with England in 1786 allowed British manufactured goods to enter France with low tariffs; as a result, many Parisian workers, particularly in the new textile industry, lost their jobs. Riots broke out in April, as unemployed workers wrecked one textile factory, attacked the home of [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]], the city's most prominent textile factory owner, and attacked police barricades. Twenty-five rioters and twelve members of the ''Gardes-Françaises'' were killed'. The ordinary soldiers of the Gardes, discontented with their role, began to disobey their officers. The weather also contributed to the distress of the city; the winter of 1788–1789 was exceptionally cold, with an unprecedented ninety-six days of freezing temperatures, reaching to between twenty and thirty degrees below zero Celsius. The price of a four-pound loaf of bread, the standard staple of Parisians, which was 9 sous on 17 August 1788, rose to 14 sous 6 deniers on 1 February 1789.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=92}}

The King, desperate for funds, decided to summon the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], an assembly of representatives of the nobility, clergy and the &quot;Third Estate&quot;, the wealthy bourgeois and professional class, to raise funds for his government. On May 12, a week after the assembly had begun, Paris elected its Third Estate representatives, led by the prominent astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]]. When the meeting began at Versailles he was elected leader of all of the Third Estate deputies. The meeting took place in the tennis court of the Palace of Versailles. On June 23, the King, displeased by the opposition of Bailly and the Third Estate deputies, tried to have them expelled from the meeting. Bailly refused to leave, declaring that &quot;A nation assembled cannot receive orders.&quot; A large part of the clergy and forty-seven nobles, led by the Duke of Orleans, took the side of Bailly. On June 24 he King was forced to yield and welcomed the new assembly, but soon afterwards, pressured by his court, he tried to regain control and ordered twenty army regiments to march to Paris. July 11, he defied the Estates-General by dismissing his reformist finance minister, [[Jacques Necker]].

As news of the dismissal of Necker spread, Paris became extremely agitated. An English visitor named Young described the atmosphere in one Paris café:

&quot;Not only was the inside of the cafe was full, but there was a crowd of listeners at the doors and windows, listening to the speakers, who, standing on chairs and tables, each had his own small audience. One cannot imagine the thunderous applause that greeted each expression of defiance and violence against the government. I am astonished that the ministry could permit such nests and hotbeds of sedition and revolt.&quot;{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=95}}

The tensions quickly turned to violence. On 11 July 1789, soldiers of the Royal-Allemand regiment attacked a peaceful demonstration of Parisians protesting the dismissal of Necker on Place Louis XV (now [[Place de la Concorde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Paris p. 669-676&quot;&gt;''Dictionnaire Historique de Paris'', La Livre de Poche, p. 669-676&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July, a mob of Parisians occupied the ''Hôtel de Ville'', and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] organized a [[National Guard (France)|''Garde nationale'']] to defend the city against the army. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the [[Invalides]], acquiring thousands of guns, and [[storming of the Bastille|stormed the Bastille]], a symbol of royal authority, a prison which at the time held only seven prisoners, and was defended by eighty invalid soldiers, reinforced by thirty-six Swiss guards. About forty Revolutionaries were killed in the fighting.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=95}} The governor of the Bastille, the [[Bernard-René de Launay|Marquis de Launay]], surrendered and then was killed, and his head put on the end of a pike and carried around Paris. The Provost of the merchants of Paris, Jacques des Fleselles, was also murdered, and his head paraded around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Combeau, Yvan, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress itself was completely demolished by November, and the stones turned into souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, pp. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The King was forced to yield. On the 15th, he withdrew his troops from the city, and on the 16th he recalled Necker to the ministry. The first independent [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]], or city council, met in the ''Hôtel de Ville'' and on 15 July, and chose a new Mayor, the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]].{{sfn|Paine|1998|p=453}} The King himself came to Paris on 17 July, where he was welcomed by the new mayor and wore the tricolor on his hat; red and blue, the colors of Paris, and white, the royal color.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lafayette&quot;&gt;Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier Lafayette (marquis de), ''Memoirs, correspondence and manuscripts of General Lafayette,'' vol. 2, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bread prices remained extremely high, at thirteen and a half sous for a four-pound loaf, as speculators and merchants held back grain to obtain higher prices or to assure reserves for an uncertain future. On 4 October Inflammatory new newspapers appeared, including the ''Ami de Peuple'' of [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] and the ''Chronique de Paris,'' blaming the aristocracy for plotting to starve Paris.{{sfn|Fierro|page=96}} On 5 October 1789, a large crowd of Parisians [[Women's March on Versailles|marched to Versailles]] and, the following day, brought the royal family and government back to Paris, as virtual prisoners. The new government of France, the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], began to meet in the ''[[Salle du Manège]]'' of the [[Tuileries Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

With both the King and Assembly in Paris, the city became calmer, and bread prices came down. On 21 May 1790, the Charter of the city of Paris was adopted, declaring the city independent of royal authority. The city was divided into twelve municipalities (later known as [[Arrondissement|''arrondissements'']]), and into forty-eight sections. It was governed by a mayor, sixteen administrators and thirty-two city council members. Bailly was formally elected Mayor by the Parisians on 2 August 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Combeau, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; A huge celebration, the ''[[Fête de la Fédération]]'', was held on the ''Champ de Mars'' on 14 July 1790 to celebrate the first anniversary of the Revolution. Before a cheering crowd of 300,000 persons, the units of the National Guard, led by the Lafayette, took an oath to defend &quot;The Nation, the Law and the King&quot;, and swore to uphold the Constitution approved by the king.&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, tensions remained below the surface; following the seizure of the Bastille, the wealthiest Parisians began to take their belongings and go abroad for their own safety. This had a disastrous effect on the Paris economy, putting out of work dressmakers and tailors, furniture makers, cooks, maids and servants and shopkeepers in the luxury goods business. 
[[File:Federation.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Fête de la Federation on the Champ de Mars celebrated the first anniversary of the Revolution (July 14, 1790)]]

Revolutionary activity in Paris was centered around the new political clubs which quickly appeared. The radical [[Jacobins]] had their headquarters in the former convent of the Dominicans on Rue Saint-Honoré, near the meeting place of the National Assembly in the [[Riding academy|manege]] of the Tuileries Palace, and the home of its most famous member, [[Robespierre]]. The Club des [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillant]]s was also headquartered in a former convent, next to the Tuileries; its members supported the Revolution, but wanted to go no further than a constitutional monarchy; its members included Mayor Bailly, the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] and [[Talleyrand]]. The supporters of the King and absolute monarchy had their own meeting place, the Club des Impartiaux, in the former convent of the Grands-Augustins, also close to the Tuileries. A former convent of the Franciscans on the left bank, between rue Racine and rue de l’École-de-Medicine, was the home of the club of [[Cordeliers]], founded in April 1790. It included some of the most fervent revolutionaries, including [[Jean-Paul Marat]], [[Georges Danton]], [[Camille Desmoulins]]. The left bank was also the home of the printers who produced newspapers and pamphlets which shaped public opinion. Some five hundred new newspapers of all political views appeared in Paris between 1789 and 1792.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=99}}

In 1791, tensions rose again as the Assembly decided to pay the debts of the State by nationalizing the property of the church, and requiring priests to take an oath of loyalty to the government. On 18 April 1791, the King was prevented by angry crowd from taking his family from the Tuileries Palace to the château of Saint-Cloud, despite the intervention of Mayor Bailly and La Fayette. Louis XVI and his family decided it was time to escape, and fled Paris on 21 June 1791, but were captured in [[Varennes-en-Argonne|Varennes]] and brought back to Paris on 25 June.

Hostility grew within Paris between the liberal aristocrats and merchants, who wanted a constitutional monarchy, and the more radical ‘[[sans-culottes]] from the working-class and poor neighborhoods, who wanted a republic and the abolition of the old regime, including the aristocracy and the Church. On 17 July 1791, the National Guard fired upon a gathering of ''sans-culottes'' on the ''Champs de Mars'', killing dozens. A red flag, the symbol of martial law, was hoisted over the Hotel de Ville, some radical leaders were arrested, the club of the Cordeliers was closed, but the most radical leaders, including Danton, Marat and Desmoulins and Santerre escaped. Bailly and Lafayette lost what remained of their popularity, and open war broke out between the more moderate and more radical revolutionaries.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=103}}

===The fall of the monarchy===
Beginning 21 January 1792, the sans-culottes and their leaders from the radical clubs took over the major food depots of the Faubourgs Saint-Antoine, Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, seizing grain and food products and selling them at prices that they thought were fair. The police and national guard did not interfere, but simply maintained order at the markets. Thanks to a slave revolt and anarchy on the French island of Saint-Dominique, sugar supplies to the city stopped, increasing discontent in all the cafes of Paris.

The King, a prisoner in the Tuileries Palace, hoped for a military intervention by Austria and Prussia to restore his power. The Radicals and Jacobins newly elected to the National Assembly also sought war, believing it would expose traitors and unite the French against the monarch and their enemies. The French Army had lost most of its officers, who were members of the nobility; six thousand of the nine thousand officers had emigrated. Parisians read in their newspapers that armies of emigres hostile to the Revolution were gathering on the northern and eastern frontiers of France, and were told by the more radical newspapers that aristocrats and their supporters in Paris were secretly preparing to seize power.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=104}} On 20 April 1792, the Assembly voted for war against the Habsburg Empire. The French army, without officers and with its men in rebellion, lost all discipline. [[Théobald Dillon]], an Irish-born French general and aristocrat, was accused by his soldiers of favoring the Austrians and killed.{{sfn|Fierro|[page=104}}

The Jacobins, Cordeliers and their allies were increasingly in control of the legislature meeting in the Tuileries. On 7 May 1792, the assembly authorized the deportation of any priest who refused to take an oath to the government, or was denounced by a citizen. On 29 May, they dissolved the regiment that guarded the King. On 20 June sans-culottes invaded the Tuileries Palace, where they forced the King to put on a red liberty cap and to drink a toast to the nation. General Lafayette disgusted by the actions of the ''sans-culottes'', quit the National Guard and offered to organize a military coup to save the King, but Marie Antoinette refused to allow it, saying, &quot;better to perish than to be saved by Lafayette.&quot;{{sfn|Fierro|[page=104}}
[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The storming of the Tuileries Palace and massacre of the Swiss guards, 10 August 1792]]
The Austrian and Prussian armies began to assemble on the northern and eastern frontiers of France, and the legislature issued a warning that the nation was in danger. On 29 July, at the Jacobins Club, Robespierre demanded suspension of the monarchy, and the election of a National Convention to write a new constitution. On 1 August, news reached Paris that the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duke of Brunswick]], commander of the army of the [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King of Prussia]], threatened to destroy Paris unless the Parisians accepted the authority of their king.&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, pp. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before midnight on 9 August, Danton rang the church bell of the Cordelier Club, signaling an insurrection. The ''sans-culottes'' took over the ''Hôtel-de-Ville'', deposed the Paris City government, put the second mayor of Paris, [[Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve]], under house arrest, and established their own government, the insurrectional Commune. At six in the morning on the 10th, armed sans-culottes from the more radical sections of the city, joined by volunteers for the new revolutionary army who had just arrived from Brest and Marseille, attacked the Tuileries Palace. The Palace was defended by two thousand national guardsmen, whose loyalty to the King was uncertain; a company of two hundred volunteer nobles, and nine hundred Swiss guards. Early in the morning the commander of the National Guard at the Palace was invited to an urgent meeting, where he was surprised and murdered. The King and his family were persuaded to leave at the Palace, to take refuge with the National Assembly in the riding academy a short distance away. He had just left the Palace when volunteers from Brest and Marseille forced the gates and the Swiss Guards opened fire. A bloody battle followed, even after the King sent a message ordering the Swiss guards to cease fire. Most of the noble volunteers and remaining National Guardsmen escaped, but two thirds of the Swiss guards, recognizable in their red uniforms, were massacred.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=105-107}}

On 11 August, the insurrectional Commune declared that France would be governed by a [[National Convention]], which would write a new Constitution. On 13 August, Louis XVI and his family were imprisoned in the Temple fortress. The Commune was composed of two hundred eighty-eight members, mostly from the Cordeliers and Jacobin clubs and mostly from the middle class and liberal professions, including the lawyer Robespierre and Danton, the new minister of justice. As news arrived that the Austrians and Prussians had invaded France and were advancing toward Paris, the Commune imposed harsher and harsher measures, including the arrest of children and wives of those who had emigrated. From 2 to 6 September 1792, bands of ''sans-culottes'' broke into the prisons and murdered between a third and half of the three thousand prisoners they found there including priests who had refused to take an oath supporting the government, the surviving Swiss guards, and a large number of common criminals.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=108}}

Voting for members of the Convention took place in early September, under the intimidating eye of the sans-culottes, who filled the Paris voting places. Twenty-four members were elected from Paris, including Robespierre, Danton, Marat, Camille Desmoulins, and the painter David. On 20 September, the hastily assembled revolutionary army won an indecisive victory at [[Valmy]], causing the Prussians to withdraw, and saving Paris from attacks by the royalists. 
On 21 September, at its first meeting, the Convention abolished the monarchy, and the next day declared France to be a republic. The Convention moved its meeting place to a large hall within the Tuileries Palace. The Committee of Public Safety, charged with hunting down the enemies of the Revolution, established its headquarters close by in the ''[[Pavillon de Flore]]'' of the Louvre, while the Tribunal, the revolutionary court, set up its courtroom within the old Royal Palace on the ''Île-de-la-Cité'', inside what is now the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|''Palais de Justice'']].&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, pp. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commune, the government of Paris, also held elections, but these were won by the more moderate members, known as the ''Girondins'', rather than the more radical faction, the ''Montagnards'', largely because the election, unlike the Convention vote, was by secret ballot. The minority Montagnards retaliated by calling a meeting of the Commune without notifying the Girondins, redrafted the election rules in their favor, and in February 1793 eliminated the Girondins and elected a city government dominated by the Montagnards and the sans-culottes.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=110-111}} 
 
[[File:Execution of Louis XVI.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The execution of King Louis XVI on the Place de la Revolution. Drums were played loudly so his final words to the crowd could not be heard.]]

===The Convention and the Reign of Terror===
The Convention put the King on trial, and after two months, voted by a majority of a single vote, for his execution. On 21 January 1793, Louis XVI was guillotined on the [[Place de la Concorde|''Place de la Révolution'']] (former ''Place Louis XV'', now Place de la Concorde. Following the King's execution, rebellions against the government broke out in many regions of the country, particularly Brittany and Angevin. The Minister of Defense of the Commune, [[Dumouriez]], tried without success to persuade his soldiers to march on Paris to overthrow the new government, and ended up defecting to the Austrians. To deal with these new threats, real or imagined, on 6 April 1793 the Convention established a Committee of Public Safety, to hunt for enemies and watch over the actions of the government. New decrees were issued for the arrest of families of émigrés, aristocrats and refractory priests, and the immunity from arrest of members of the Convention was taken away. On 10 March the Convention created a revolutionary Tribunal, located in the Palace of Justice. Verdicts of the Tribunal could not be appealed, and sentences were to be carried out immediately.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=112}} [[Marie Antoinette]] was beheaded on 16 October 1793, and [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], the first elected mayor of Paris, was executed on 12 November 1793. The property of the aristocracy and of the Church was confiscated and declared ''[[Biens nationaux]]'' (national property); the churches were closed.

The government struggled to maintain the food supply to the city, particularly the supply of bread. Bakers were allowed to make only one kind of bread, known as ''pain de l’égalité'', or &quot;equality bread&quot;. Fortunately for the government there was a good harvest and grain was abundant. Firewood and charcoal, needed for cooking and heating, however, were in very short supply, and crowds of sans-culottes frequently invaded the depots.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=115}}

The Convention moved to eliminate all vestiges of religion, the aristocracy, and the old regime. The [[French Republican Calendar]], a new non-Christian calendar, was created, with the year 1793 becoming &quot;Year One&quot;: 27 July 1794 was &quot;9 Thermidor of the year II&quot;. Many street names were changed, and the revolutionary slogan, &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot;, was engraved on the façades of government buildings. New forms of address were required: ‘’Monsieur’’ and ‘’Madame’’ were replaced by ‘’Citoyen’’ and ‘’Citoyenne’’, and the formal ‘’vous’’ was replaced by the more proletarian ‘’tu’’.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarmant, Thierry p. 144&quot;&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Stores were forbidden to close on Sunday, and the heads of the statues of Saints on the façade of Notre-Dame cathedral were decapitated. Streets named for saints had the word &quot;saint&quot; effaced with a hammer. On 10 November, the first festival of Reason and Liberty was celebrated at the Cathedral.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=115}}
[[File:Fête de l'Etre suprême 2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Festival of the Supreme Being, held on 8 June 1794 on the [[Champs de Mars]], was an official celebration of [[Cult of reason]] presided over by [[Robespierre]]. On July 27 he was arrested and sent to the guillotine, ending the [[reign of terror]].]]

On December 4, 1793, the relative independence of the city government of Paris that it had enjoyed since 1789 was ended; the districts of the city, corresponding roughly to the present arrondissements, were placed under the control of the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee, with &quot;National Agents&quot; placed in each district to assure that they observed the decrees of the national government.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=116}} A struggle for power broke out within the Convention between the supporters of Robespierre and those of [[Georges Danton]], leading to the arrest of Danton and his supporters on 30 March, his judgment by the Revolutionary Tribunal, and his execution on 5 April 1794. On 10 June a new decree deprived those brought before Revolutionary Tribunal of any legal rights. Between 6 April 1793 and 10 June 1794, the Revolutionary Tribune had pronounced 1,250 death sentences in ninety days; between 11 June and 27 July 1794, it issued 1,376 death sentences in just 47 days. Those condemned were sent from the Palais de Justice to the execution site in convoys of carts. The guillotine was moved to the edge of the city, at the '''Barrière du Trône'', farther from the public eye, and the pace of executions accelerated to as many as fifty a day; the cadavers were buried in common graves on rue de Picpus. Among those executed in the last great surge of the reign of terror were the eminent chemist [[Lavoisier]] (8 May 1794) and the poet [[Andre Chenier]], executed 25 July 1794, just two days before the end of the Terror.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=120-121}}

On June 8, 1793, at the debut of the new wave of terror, Robespierre presided over the [[Festival of the Supreme Being]] in the huge amphitheater on the Champs de Mars which had been constructed in 1990 for the first anniversary of the Revolution; the ceremony was designed by the painter David, and featured a ten-hour parade, bonfires a statue of wisdom, and a gigantic mountain with a tree of liberty at the peak. The pretensions of Robespierre annoyed many of those present, and there were cries of &quot;dictator!&quot; and &quot;tyrant!&quot; from some in the crowd.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=120-121}} The growing number of enemies of Robespierre within the Convention began to quietly plot against him. On 26 July, Robespierre, sensing what was happening, gave a long speech at the Commune, denouncing &quot;a conspiracy against the public liberties&quot;, calling for a purge of the Convention and the arrest of his enemies. Instead of supporting him, the more moderate members of the Commune rose and spoke against him. The following day he was prevented from speaking to the Commune. The next day bells were rung calling the ''sans-culottes'' to arms to defend Robespierre, but few responded. Early in the morning of 28 July, policemen and members of the National Guard summoned by the Convention invaded the Hôtel de Ville and arrested Robespierre and his twenty-one remaining supporters. They were guillotined at seven in the evening the same day, before a large and approving crowd.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=124}}

==Paris under the Directory (1795-1799)==
[[File:Boilly-Point-de-Convention-ca1797.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Parisians during the Directory, by Louis-Léopold Boilly. A ''decrotteur'' scrapes mud from the man's boots]]
Following the execution of Robespierre, the executions stopped and the prisons gradually emptied, but the city remained agitated and barely functional. The former city government, the Commune, had virtually disappeared; of the one hundred forty members of its General Council before the Terror, eighty-seven had been guillotined, and forty imprisoned. Of the thirty-three senior city administrators, twenty had been executed and ten imprisoned. It was impossible to have a document registered for lack of living city employees.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=125}} On August 24, 1794, the new government of France, the [[French Directory|Directory]], created a whole new city government had to be created. The forty-eight sections, each governed by a revolutionary committee, were replaced by twelve arrondissements, strictly under the control of the Directory. Each arrondissement was governed by a committee of seven persons, named by the Directory. The police were under the command of a commission named by the national government. On 11 October 1795, the position of Mayor of Paris was abolished, and replaced by a committee of five administrators of the Department of the Seine, with it offices on Place Vendôme. The most important person in the new city structure was the ''Commissaire'' named by the Directory to supervise the administration of the city, a post which eventually became known as the Prefect of the Seine.

The life of ordinary Parisians was extremely difficult, due to a very cold winter in 1794–95, there were shortages and long lines for bread, firewood, charcoal meat, sugar, coffee, vegetables and wine. The money dropped sharply in value; an ''assignat'', or banknote originally issued for one hundred ''livres'', was worth thirty-four ''livres'' at the time of death of Robespierre, and sixteen in March 1795, and 4 in June 1795. Two thousand six hundred Parisians were reported as dying from hunger in January 1795, and two thousand more during the spring.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=124-128}}

The shortages led to unrest; on 1 April 1795 a crowd of Parisians, including many women and children, invaded the meeting hall of the Convention, demanding bread and the return of the old revolutionary government. They were removed from the hall by the army and the national guard. The city was placed under a state of siege and four members of the old Robespierre, blamed for the invasion, were promptly deported to Madagascar and Guyana. Another uprising took place on 20 May 1795, with another invasion of the meeting hall by ''sans-culottes''; one deputy was killed and his head paraded around; a group of radical deputies, controlling the hall, voted for a return to the revolutionary government, and bells were rung in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine calling for a general uprising. The uprising went no further;the majority of Deputies returned to the hall and overturned the decision of the radicals, and soldiers surrounded the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and disarmed the ''sans culottes''.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=124-128}}
[[File:Attaque de la Convention nationale, 1790.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The cannons of Napoleon clear rue Saint-Honoré of royalist insurgents (October 5, 1795)]]

On 3 October 1795, a coalition of royalists and constitutional monarchists made their own attempt to replace the government, taking up arms and marching in two columns on the Tuileries Palace. The first column on Quai Voltaire was met by a young general of artillery, Napoleon Bonaparte, who had placed cannon on the opposite side of the river at the gates of the Louvre and the head of the Pont de la Concorde. The cannon fire broke up the first royalist column. The second column tried to advance on rue Saint-Honore, and briefly took up position at the theater of the Comédie-Française and then made a last stand on the steps of the Church of Saint-Roche, but were unable to resist the cannon fire. The rebellion was finished by six in the evening; about two hundred royalists were killed, and an equal number of supporters of the Convention; Napoleon's career as a commander and political figure was launched.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=124-128}}

New elections were held in October 1795, and brought into power a government dominated by moderate republicans; the Paris contingent of elected officials included merchants, bankers, notaries, lawyers, as well as more radical revolutionaries and monarchists. Plots and uprisings succeeded one another; a conspiracy of monarchists attempted an uprising on 4 September 1797, but were quickly suppressed by the army. Radical Jacobins won the elections of April 1799, and allied themselves with their arch-enemies, the monarchists, to oppose the Directory. Among the twelve newly elected Directors and Ministers, seven had voted for the execution of the King. It appeared that the Revolution might begin again, when on 13 October 1799 Napoleon Bonaparte returned from his campaign in Egypt and organized a coup d’État that made him the First Consul.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=135-138}}

===Parisian society, marriage and divorce===
During the Directory, almost all the structures and rules of Paris society had been swept away, but no new structures and rules had yet been created to replace them. The [[brothers Goncourt]] meticulously described the period on their ''Histoire de la société française pendant le Directoire''. Caste and rank mattered far less; all the old titles and forms of address had disappeared, along with old customs and social conventions. Men no longer took off their hats when talking to women, and people of different ranks spoke to each other as equals. Society no longer met in private, in the houses of the nobility, but in public, at balls, restaurants and public gardens. As the Goncourts said, &quot;social anarchy&quot; reigned in Paris: &quot;everyone met with everyone.&quot; Government ministers could be seen walking or dining with actresses, bankers with courtesans.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=178}}
 
&quot;Liaisons were easy&quot;, the Goncourts reported, &quot;marriage less so.&quot; The old system of marriages arranged between families based on fortune, profession, and social condition was less common. Marriages were no longer controlled by the church, but by the new civil code, which described marriage as &quot;nature in action.&quot; Marriage was seen as a temporary, not a permanent state. Children born outside of marriage were given equal status concerning inheritance and other legal matters as those born to married couples. Divorce was much simpler, and could be requested by either the husband or wife. In one period of fifteen months, 5,994 civil law divorces were granted in Paris, of which 3,886 were requested by the wife. of 1,148 divorces granted on the grounds of &quot;incompatibility of humor&quot;, 887 were requested by the wife. The new system also led to a large increase in the number of children born outside of marriage and not wanted; in 1795 four thousand unwanted children in the Department of the Seine were turned over to founding hospitals.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=185}}

The breakdown of the old system of arranged marriages led to the creation of the first newspaper where men and women could advertise themselves for suitable spouses, called the ''Indicateur des marriages''. it also led to the establishment of the first marriage bureaus. A businessman named Liardot rented a large former mansion, brought in selected eligible young women as paying guests, and invited men seeking wives to meet them at balls, concerts and card games each given at the house each evening. The men were screened by their profession and education.{{sfn|de Goncourt|page=185}}

===The ''Muscadins''===
[[File:Les Incroyables (1795, Loursay).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Muscadins&quot; by Loursay (1795)]]
Even before the end of Robespierre, a new royalist social movement, called the ''[[Muscadins]]'' had appeared. These were largely upper middle class young men, numbering between and two and three thousand, who dressed in an extravagant fashion, spoke with an exaggerated accent, carried canes as weapons, and, particularly in 1794 and 1795, they patrolled the streets in groups and attacked ''sans culottes'' and symbols of the revolution. They tried to be and act like the nobility of the Ancien Regime, and mostly tried to live in the abandoned [[Le Marais|Marais]] area. One of the most extreme of the revolutionaries, [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], the editor of the radical newspaper ''L'Ami du people'' (&quot;Friend of the people&quot;) had been assassinated on 13 July 1793, and on 22 September 1794, his ashes had been placed with great ceremony in the Pantheon, alongside those of Voltaire and Rousseau. After the downfall of Robespierre, the Convention issued a decree that no one should be entered in the Pantheon who had not been dead for ten years. The ''Muscadin''s went even further, invading the Pantheon, destroying Marat's monument and removing his ashes.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=127}}

===The Arts during the Directory - the Salon and the Louvre===
The artists of Paris were in a difficult situation during the Directory; their most important patrons, the aristocracy, had been executed or sent into exile, and a new wealthy class was just being formed. Before the Revolution a half-figure portrait could be commissioned from a less-known artist for three hundred livres. During the Directory the price fell to forty-eight livres.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=268}} Nonetheless, the Salon took place in the Louvre in 1795 as it had in the years before the Revolution, and each year thereafter. The most prominent artist of the revolutionary period, David, closely connected with the Jacobins, was in seclusion in his studio inside the Louvre, but a new generation of artists showed their works; [[François Gérard]]; [[Anne-Louis Girodet]], a pupil of David, famous for his romantic paintings, particularly a 1797 painting of the prominent actress and courtesan Mademoiselle Lange as Venus; [[Carle Vernet]], the son and father of famous painters; The portrait painter [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]], who painted all the rulers of France from Marie-Antoinette through Napoleon III; the genre painter [[Louis-Léopold Boilly]]; [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], a young history and landscape painter, who soon achieved fame and a government position in 1796 with a heroic portrait of Napoleon at the [[battle of Arcole]]; the romantic landscapes of [[Hubert Robert]]; [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]], whose work combined classicism and romanticism; and a major neoclassical sculptor from the earlier generation, the sculptor [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], famous for his busts of George Washington and Voltaire.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=268}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The idea of making the Louvre into an art museum had first been proposed in 1747 by Lafont de Saint-Yenne and supported by Diderot in 1765 in the article on the Louvre in the ''Encylopedie''. The idea was accepted by Louis XVI, who in 1789 began work on the Grand Gallery of the Louvre. The Revolution intervened, and on 27 July 1793 the Convention decreed the creation of a Museum of the Republic, which opened on 10 August 1793, the anniversary of the storming of the Tuileries.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1004}}

In 1797, at the end of Napoleon's triumphant first Italian campaign, convoys of wagons began arriving in Paris, carrying bronze horses, Greek antiquities, tapestries, marble statues, paintings and other works of art taken from Italian cities under the terms of peace agreed by the Austrians. They included works by [[Raphael]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]], [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese]] and other masters. Other convoys arrived from the Netherlands and Flanders with more art from the Spanish provinces. The more famous works were displayed on wagons in a festive victory parade through the center of Paris. The rest was crammed, unwrapped, into the corridors, galleries and stairways of the Louvre. Work began to rebuild the Gallery of Apollo and other galleries to provide a home for the new art.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1860|pages=283-287}}

===Amusement—the Ball of the Victims, Pleasure Gardens, and new cafés===
Balls were banned again by Robespierre and the Jacobins, but after their downfall, the city experienced a frenzy of dancing which lasted throughout the period of the [[French Directory]]. The Goncourt brothers reported that six hundred forty balls took place in 1797 alone. Several former monasteries were turned into ballrooms, including the Novicial of the Jesuits, the convent of the Carmelites in the Maris, the seminary of Saint Sulpice, and even in the former cemetery Saint-Sulpice. Some of the former palatial townhouses of the nobility were rented and used for ballrooms; the Hotel Longueville put on enormous spectacles, with three hundred couples dancing, in thirty circles of sixteen dancers each, the women in nearly transparent consumes, styled after Roman togas. In the public balls, everyone danced with everyone; merchants, clerks, artisans and workers danced with shop women and seamstresses. In the more popular public balls, the ''cavaliers'' were charged 80 sous for admission, while women paid 12 sous. At more exclusive balls, admission was five livres.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=145-146}} Aristocrats who had survived or returned from exile held their own balls in their houses in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. There events called &quot;Balls of the Victims&quot; were organized, where the invitees had lost at least one parent to the guillotine.

The formal dancing of the minuet was replaced by a much more passionate new dance, the [[waltz]], which was introduced to Paris during this time from Germany. For summer evening entertainment, Parisians began to abandon the Tuileries Gardens and the gardens of the Palais-Royal and went to the new pleasure gardens which appeared in the neighborhood between the Grand boulevards and the Palais-Royal. The most famous was the Tivoli, located on rue Saint-Lazare, it had belonged to an aristocrat named Boutin, who was guillotined during the reign of terror. It was enormous, forty ''arpents'' in size, and could hold as many as ten thousand persons. It had alleys filled with promenaders, greenhouses, illuminations, an orchestra, dancing, a café and fireworks. Other new gardens competed by adding spectacles and pageants. The Élysée offered a pageant of costumed soldiers on horseback performing elaborate maneuvers and firing weapons. The Mouceaux had performers dressed as American Indians dancing and fighting battles. The Pavillon de Hannovre, formerly part of the residential complex of Cardinal Richelieu, featured a terrace for dancing and dining decorated with Turkish tents, Chinese kiosks and lanterns.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=213-234}}

Many new restaurants and cafes appeared in and around the Palais-Royal and the new boulevards, usually close to the twenty-three theaters. A new café, Tortoni, specializing in ice creams, opened in 1795 at the corner of rue Taibout and the grand boulevards. The new restaurants in the Palais-Royal were often run by the former chefs of archbishops or nobles who had gone into exile. The restaurant Méot offered a menu with over a hundred dishes. Beside Méot and Beauvilliers, the Palais-Royal had the restaurants Naudet, Robert, Very, Foy and Huré, and the Cafés Berceau, Lyrique, Liberté Conquise, de Chartres, and du Sauvage (the last owned by the former coachman of Robespierre). In the cellars of the Palais-Royal there were more popular cafés, usually with music, smaller menus and more reasonable prices. One restaurant in the cellars, Postal, offered a menu for just 36 sous. Many of the cafes in the cellars had orchestras; the most famous was the Café des Aveugles, which had an orchestra of blind musicians.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=73-83}}

Following the end of the reign of terror, the dining hours for upper-class Parisians returned gradually to what they had been before the Revolution, with ''déjeuner'' at midday, dinner at 6 or seven in the evening, and supper at 2 in the morning. When the theater performances ended at ten in the evening, the theater audiences went to the nearby cafés on the boulevards.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|page=74}}

===Paris at the end of the century===
Paris after the end of the terror, as described by the walls covered with old posters and proclamations, fountains without water, abandoned animals roaming the streets. The churches were closed, emptied of paintings and objects of art, the crosses replaced by a red liberty cap on top of a pike, and the words &quot;National Property for sale&quot; painted on the wall. The Cathedral of Notre Dame, the statues removed from its facade and the art from its interior, was used as a storage place for kegs of wine. The Hôtel-Dieu hospital had been renamed the ''Hospice of Humanity&quot;, and the 130 sisters of the order of Saint Augustine, who had tended the poor, were gone.

Thousands of poor people from the countryside came into seeking the inexpensive bread subsidized by the Commune. Thousands of sellers of wine and spirits set up shop on the streets. The quays of the Seine were transformed into vast outdoor markets, where people sold any bric-a-brac, jewelry or trinkets, books paintings of other items of value they possessed. Many churches and other large buildings had been turned into sales depots, where the belongings of the church or nobles who had emigrated were put on sale. Sainte-Chapelle was turned into a store where papers needed for judicial hearings were sold.{{sfn|de Goncourt|1864|pages=8-30}}

Many prominent historic buildings, including the enclosure of the Temple, the Abbey of Montmartre, and most of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, were nationalized and demolished. Many churches were sold as public property, and were demolished for their stone and other construction material. [[Henri Grégoire]], a priest and elected member of the Convention, invented a new word, “vandalism”, to describe the destruction of the churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarmant, Thierry p. 144&quot;/&gt;

A small group of scholars and historians collected statues and paintings from the demolished churches, and made a storeroom of the old ''Couvent des Petits-Augustins'', in order to preserve them. The paintings went to the Louvre, where the Central Museum of the Arts was opened at the end of 1793. In October 1795, the collection at the ''Petits-Augustins'' became officially the Museum of French Monuments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarmant, Thierry p. 145&quot;&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Demonstration of 20 June 1792''' ({{lang-fr|Journée du 20 juin 1792}}) was the last peaceful attempt made by the people of [[Paris]] to persuade [[King Louis XVI]] of [[France]] to abandon his current policy and attempt to follow what they believed to be a more empathetic approach to governing.  The demonstration occurred during the [[French Revolution]].  Its objectives were to convince the government to enforce the [[Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly's]], rulings, defend France against foreign invasion, and preserve the spirit of the [[French Constitution of 1791]].  The demonstrators hoped that the king would withdraw his [[veto]] and recall the ''[[Girondin]]'' ministers. 

The Demonstration was the last phase of the unsuccessful attempt to establish a [[constitutional monarchy]] in France.  After [[10 August (French Revolution)|the Insurrection of 10 August 1792]], the monarchy fell.

==Background==
Under the Girondin ministry, on 20 April 1792, King Louis XVI convinced the Legislative Assembly to declare war against [[Austria]].  The resulting war, which would last almost continuously until 1815 and shake the very foundations of Europe, put new life into the revolutionary movement in France. The monarchy was its first victim.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=241}}

Of even greater consequence was a major economic crisis.  As it struck France's towns, it again set the masses in motion.  The crisis was caused by [[inflation]] rather than scarcity as past crises, as the currency in circulation had increased by 600 million since October of 1792.  With continued [[depreciation]] of the [[assignat]], the [[exchange rate]] fell even more rapidly.  By March of 1793, French money once worth British ₤100 would buy only ₤50 worth of goods in Paris.  The flood of paper notes, misused by speculators, aggravated unrest.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|p=225}}

===Military setbacks===
France declared war on the King of [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]] ([[Austria]]) on 20 April 1792.  The French troops and their leadership were inadequate from the beginning, leaving the French army in a state of total disarray.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=241}}  The front-line regiments were insufficiently strong because most men preferred to enlist in volunteer battalions, which were better paid, elected their own officers, and could disband after the campaign.

But despite these attractions, even the volunteer battalions were slow to form.  Few volunteers were truly motivated to fight.  Frequently, [[National Guard (France)|National Guardsmen]], not wishing to leave their homes, offered bonuses to convince others to take their place and to muster the necessary quotas.  Consequently, it took time for a sufficient quantity of men to enlist.  Equipment was furnished by local authorities but arrived slowly, and insufficient arms were available.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|p = 222}}

French general [[Charles François Dumouriez]] thought the army could get its training in combat.  He argued that the enemy had no more than 30,000 men to throw into a campaign, and that foreign troops would be arranged in a cordon from the sea to [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]].  He proposed to break through this barrier: one column each from [[Veurne|Furnes]], [[Lille]], [[Valenciennes]], and [[Givet]], totalling more than 50,000 men, would set out on 29 April towards the enemy line.

The other generals, however, were trained for regular war and rejected this plan.  Additionally, the officers distrusted their undisciplined troops, while the troops were suspicious of their generals in return.  Out of 9,000 officers, at least half had already emigrated, and a few more deserted on the eve of the offensive.  In May, several others took three regiments into the enemy camp. 

On April 29, at the sight of the first Austrian troops, [[Théobald Dillon]] and [[Armand Louis de Gontaut]] ordered a retreat.  Their men cried [[treason]] and disbanded; Dillon was murdered at Lille.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|p = 223}}

The generals blamed these setbacks on a lack of discipline and on a ministry that tolerated such conditions.  In reply, the Gironde ordered Dillon’s murderers prosecuted, along with [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who had been exhorting the soldiers to get rid of their generals.  A new decree tightened military justice and authorized the generals to issue regulations bearing penalties for infractions. The decree undeniably marked a surrender of legislative power, but to no avail.  On 18 May, the leaders of the armies, meeting at [[Valenciennes]], disregarded repeated orders from the ministry and declared an offensive impossible, advising the king to make immediate peace.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|p = 223}}

As a result, the generals suspended the offensive.  On May, a whole corps, the Royal-Allemand, defected to the enemy.  [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau]], commander of the [[Army of the North (France)|''Armée du Nord'']], resigned.  Assembly member [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]] went as far as deliberate treachery.  Secretly, he proposed to the Austrians that fighting should be suspended so that he could turn his army against Paris in order to disperse the [[Jacobins]] and establish a strong regime.{{sfn|Vovelle|1984|p=224}}

===Decrees of the Assembly===
The Girondins saw no choice but to fall back on the policy of intimidation that had brought them to power.  With this goal in mind, the Assembly passed three decrees.

The first decree was directed against the priests who had refused the oath to the civil constitution.  Religious disturbances necessitated some decisive action against them, as the state could not be preserved if it continued treating as members of society those who were evidently seeking to dissolve it.  One proposal suggested assembling the non-juring priests in the capitals of the departments, but this would have meant creating eighty-three centers of discord, fanaticism, and counter-revolution.  The majority of the Assembly concluded the country must be purged.  After several days of discussion, fearing the overthrow of the constitution, the Assembly passed the following decree on 27 May 1792: &quot;When twenty active citizens of a canton shall demand that a nonjuring priest leave the realm, the directory of the department must order his [[deportation]] if the directory agrees with the petition.  If the directory does not agree with the demand of the twenty citizens, it shall determine through committees whether the presence of the priest is a threat to public peace, and if the opinion of the committee supports the demand of the twenty petitioners, the deportation shall be ordered.&quot; This decree made the clergy choose between the oath to the constitution and deportation.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1913|p=13}}

This measure was followed by another directed against the king's bodyguards. The guard had revealed anti-revolutionary sentiments and had uttered threats against the Assembly.  The guard was believed to be [[royalist]] in its sympathies; wholly devoted to the person of the king; hostile to the government; and wholly lacking in [[esprit de corps]].  Assembly member [[Claude Basire]] proposed the guard's dissolution, charging its officers with orgies and a plan for carrying away the king.  He asked to be allowed to give proof of his accusations the next day.  Meanwhile, fellow Assembly member [[François Chabot]] declared that he had 182 documents proving the existence of a plot to dissolve the Assembly, set for 27 May.  In response, the Assembly decreed that its sessions should be continuous; that the Paris guard should be doubled; and that Paris's mayor, [[Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve]], should be required to make a daily report on the state of the capital city.  Regarding the king's bodyguards, Assembly member [[Marguerite-Élie Guadet]] articulated three arguments for the guard's dissolution: first, that it was illegally organized; second, that its chiefs sought to inspire revolt; and third, that the majority favored a counter-revolution.  On 29 May 1792, the Assembly decreed that the guard should be dissolved and its commander, the [[Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac|Duc de Brissac]], arrested.  This decree was executed immediately.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1913|p=14}}

The third decree provided for a camp of 20,000 ''[[fédérés]]'' (French National Guardsmen) to be assembled on 14 June near Paris.  French general [[Joseph Marie Servan de Gerbey]] made this proposition on 4 June, reportedly without consulting either his colleagues or the king.  He argued that the initiative was necessary to establish tranquility in the country.  The decree itself stated that its purpose was to improve [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|fraternity]] between the departments of France.  However, discussions in the Assembly indicated that the decree's purpose was to ensure public security.  As allies were approaching from without and enemies of the constitution were plotting from within, Paris and the Assembly needed protection.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1913|p=16}}

===Fall of the Girondin Ministry===
King Louis refused to sacrifice the non-juring priests or to authorize the establishment of a military camp of fédérés.  On 12 June 1792, a letter from [[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Platière]], Louis' [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Minister of the Interior]], urged the King to yield on these two points, stating that his refusal would provoke the fall of the throne and a massacre of the aristocrats.  The next day, the King dismissed Roland, along with [[Étienne Clavière]], his [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Minister of Finance]], and General Servan.  On 15 June, General Dumouriez's reception by the Assembly was hostile enough to convince him that he would be arraigned.  Since the King insisted on approving only the decree disbanding his guard, Dumouriez resigned and left to rejoin the Army of the North.  The [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillants]] returned to power in a new ministry.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|p=227}}

On 18 June, Lafayette, judging that the moment had come, called on the Assembly to destroy the democratic movement, declaring: &quot;[The] Constitution of France [is] threatened by [[sedition|seditious]] groups within the country as well as by its enemies abroad.&quot;  The King's use of the royal veto, his dismissal of the Girondin ministers, and the formation of a Feuillant ministry all served to show that he and the generals were attempting to enforce the political program advocated by the followers of Lafayette and [[Alexandre-Théodore-Victor, comte de Lameth]].  They were seeking to get rid of the Jacobin threat, revise the Constitution so as to reinforce royal authority, and bring the war to an end by making a deal with the enemy.{{sfn|Soboul|1974|p=245}}

==''Journée du 20 juin''==
Faced with the threat of a [[coup]] from either the royal family or the Feuillants, the Girondins tried to make use of the popular dynamism evident in sections of Paris.  The Parisian mayor, Pétion, was sympathetic to their cause and helped the Girondins in these attempts.{{sfn|Vovelle|1984|p=226}}

The anniversary of the [[Tennis Court Oath]] on 20 June was approaching.  Sergent and Panis, the administrators of police sent out by Pétion, reached the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]] at about 8 o'clock.  They urged the people to lay down their weapons, telling them it was illegal to present a petition in arms.  The people refused to abandon their arms and said they did not intend to attack the Assembly or the King.  They said they had two objectives: to form a procession for the twenty legal petitioners who wished to present a petition to the Assembly and the King, and to celebrate the anniversary of the Tennis Court Oath by planting a [[maypole]] in military fashion.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1913|p=56}}

By five o'clock in the morning on 20 June, groups had formed in the Faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marcel, consisting of National Guardsmen, pikemen, gunners with their cannon, men armed with sabers or clubs, women, and children.  Other armed petitioners had already appeared before the National Assembly.  To prove to the city officials that they had no desire to riot, they invited the officials join the procession and march along with them.{{sfn|Taine|2011|p=298}}

The Legislative Assembly met about noon on the 20th, but did not turn its attention first to the threatened uprising.  After some other business had been discussed, the president announced that the directory of the department wished to be admitted.  The directory had shown great interest in trying to prevent the procession and had been in session since four o'clock in the morning.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1913|p=63}}

[[Pierre Louis Roederer]], the ''procureur'' of the Paris department, brought the news about the mass protest to the Assembly.  However, in the meantime, the crowd had reached the doors of the Assembly hall.  Their leaders asked permission to enter and present a petition.  A violent debate arose between the Right, who were unwilling to admit the armed petitioners, and the Left, who, on the grounds of custom, wished to receive them.  [[Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud]] argued that the Assembly would violate every principle by admitting armed bands; however, he admitted that it was impossible to deny a request in this case that had been granted in so many others.  A majority of the representatives agreed that the petitioners should be allowed in.  However, the crowd had already thronged the passages when the Assembly decided to admit them. The deputation was introduced.{{sfn|Mignet|1824|p=156}}

The deputation's spokesman, Sulpice Huguenin, expressed himself in threatening language.  He said that the people were agitated; that they were ready to make use of the means stated in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] to resist oppression; that the dissenting members of the assembly, if there were any, wanted to destroy liberty and go to [[Koblenz]].  Then, returning to the true object of the petition, he added: &quot;The executive power is not in union with you; we require no other proof of it than the dismissal of the patriot ministers. It is thus, then, that the happiness of a free nation shall depend on the caprice of a king! But should this king have any other will than that of the law? The people will have it so, and the life of the people is as valuable as that of crowned [[despotism|despots]]. That life is the genealogical tree of the nation, and the feeble reed must bend before this sturdy oak! We complain, gentlemen, of the inactivity of our armies; we require you to learn the cause of this; if it springs from the executive power, let that power be destroyed!&quot;{{sfn|Mignet|1824|p=156}}

The Assembly answered that it would take the petitioners' request into consideration; it then urged them to respect the law and the legal authorities, and allowed them to march before the Assembly.  Led by General [[Antoine Joseph Santerre]], thirty thousand people, waving revolutionary banners and symbols, sang, as they traversed the hall, the famous chorus, ''Ça ira'', and cried: &quot;''Vive la nation''!&quot; &quot;''Vivent les sans-culottes''!&quot; &quot;''À bas le veto''!&quot;  On leaving the Assembly, the group proceeded to the King's chateau, led by the petitioners.{{sfn|Mignet|1824|p=157}}

[[File:PeopleStormingTuileries.jpg|thumb|300px|Journée of 20 June 1792]]
The outer doors were opened at the King’s command, and the crowd rushed in.  They ascended to the apartments, and while they were forcing the doors open with hatchets, the King ordered them to be opened, and appeared before the crowd, accompanied by a few persons.  Louis XVI was placed in the recess of a window.  Surrounded by National Guardsmen, who formed a barrier against the mob, and seated on a chair placed on a table, Louis remained calm and firm.{{sfn|Mignet|1824|p=157}}

The crowd urged Louis to approve the decrees he had rejected.  Louis responded: &quot;This is neither the method nor the moment to obtain it of me.&quot;  Attempting to mollify the mob, he placed on his head a red cap presented to him on the top of a pike.  The crowd viewed this as a sign of humility.  He then drank a glass of wine given to him by a half-drunken workman, and received strong applause.{{sfn|Mignet|1824|p=158}}

Meanwhile, Assembly members Vergniaud and [[Maximin Isnard]], along with a few deputies of the Gironde, had moved forward to protect the King and attempt to calm the mob.  The Assembly, which had just met, convened again quickly, terrified at this outbreak, and dispatched several successive delegations to try to protect Louis XVI.  Eventually the mayor himself, Pétion, arrived; he mounted a chair, harangued the people, and urged them to withdraw quietly.  The people obeyed.  Thus, these singular insurgents, whose only aim was to obtain decrees and ministers, retired without achieving their mission.{{sfn|Mignet|1824|p=158}}

==Aftermath==
The demonstrators of 20 June did not obtain the immediate successes they had hoped for.  The day's events were disowned by the Left of the Legislature, by the future [[Girondins]], and by the [[Jacobins]].  Louis XVI, who had promised nothing, did not withdraw his veto.  The petitioners thought they had converted him to the Revolution; instead, they found him to be embittered, humiliated, and irremediably hostile.{{sfn|Aulard|1910|p=365}}

Europe saw the King insulted and treated as a prisoner.  In parts of France, [[royalism]] regained popularity.  A large number of departmental administrations protested against the insult offered to the majesty of royalty.  Lafayette, leaving his army, visited the Assembly on 28 June, demanding in the name of his soldiers that the Assembly take action against the protesters, and &quot;destroy a sect capable of infringing the national sovereignty.&quot;  But on 2 July came the news that the Army of the North was in retreat and was falling back on Lille and Valenciennes.  This made all the distrust and anxiety of the petitioners of 20 June seem justified.{{sfn|Aulard|1910|p=366}}

In the Assembly on 3 July, Vergniaud denounced all the [[treason]]ous acts of Louis XVI.  He recalled the royal veto, the disturbances it had caused in the provinces, and the deliberate inaction of the generals who had opened the way to invasion.  Furthermore, he suggested to the Assembly — though by implication rather than directly — that Louis XVI might qualify under the Constitution as being &quot;considered to have [[abdication|abdicated]] his royal office.&quot;  Thus, he put the idea of deposing the King into the public's minds.  His speech, which made an enormous impression, was circulated by the Assembly through all the [[departments of France]].{{sfn|Mathiez|1929|p=155}}

It was now certain that there would be a more violent sequel to the demonstration of 20 June 1972.  Jacobin [[Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne]] outlined a program for the next insurrection: exile the King, dismiss the generals, elect a [[National Convention]], transfer the royal veto to the people, deport all public enemies, and [[tax exemption|exempt]] the poor from taxation. This program was repeated, almost unchanged, in a strongly worded manifesto drawn up by [[Maximilien François Marie Isidore de Robespierre]], and proclaimed by a federal orator before the House. The real question was how it would be carried out.{{sfn|Thompson|1959|p=281}}

The answer came on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]] with the storming of the [[Tuileries Palace]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9297">[[File:France 1800.png|thumb|250px|The [[French First Republic]] in 1800. The then-borders of France corresponded to the 'natural borders' as defined by the French revolutionaries.]]
The '''natural borders of France''' ({{lang-fr|Frontières naturelles de la France}}) are a political and geographic theory developed in France, notably during the [[French Revolution]]. They correspond to the [[Rhine]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]], according to the revolutionaries. The term '''Greater France''' is also used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilder2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Wilder|title=The French Imperial Nation-state: Negritude &amp; Colonial Humanism Between the Two World Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtQHgL5ndz4C&amp;pg=PA39|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89772-1|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The first mention of the [[natural border]]s appeared in 1642 in an apocryphal statement by [[Armand-Jean du Plessis|Cardinal Richelieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pernot |first1=François |title=Janvier 1595 : Henri IV veut couper le Camino Español en Franche-Comté |journal=Revue historique des armées |year=2001 |issue=222 |pages=13–24 |url=http://www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/04histoire/articles/articles_rha/janvier1595henri4.htm |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212005402/http://www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/04histoire/articles/articles_rha/janvier1595henri4.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, it was not until 1786 when the idea was again developed. The [[Prussia]]n [[Jean-Baptiste Cloots]] published that year the ''Wishes of a Gallophile'' ({{lang-fr|links=no|Vœux d'un gallophile}}) and pronounced himself in favor of the annexation by France of the [[left bank of the Rhine]], &quot;natural boundary of the [[Gauls]]&quot; ({{lang-fr|links=no|borne naturelle des Gaules}}).{{sfn|Smets|1998|p=676}}
This notion was influential among the French revolutionaries after 1790, notably among the [[Jacobins]]. After the [[Battle of Valmy|victory of Valmy]] on September 20, 1792, the [[National Convention]] urged the soldiers to go after the Prussian armies of the other bank of the Rhine. For General [[Adam Philippe de Custine]], commander of the [[Army of the Rhine]], &quot;if the Rhine is not the limit of the Republic, it will perish&quot; ({{lang|fr|Si le Rhin n'est pas la limite de la République, elle périra}}).{{sfn|Smets|1998|p=677}} On December 17, the Convention adopted the Declaration of the French Revolutionary Administration of Conquered Lands ({{lang-fr|links=no|Décret sur l'administration révolutionnaire française des pays conquis}}), prelude to the annexation of [[Belgium]] by France. This was demanded by [[Georges Jacques Danton]] on January 21, 1793, justifying that &quot;the limits of France are marked by nature, we will reach the four corners of the horizon, to the edge of the Rhine, to the edge of the ocean, to the edge of the Pyrenees, to the edge of the Alps. The boundaries of our Republic must be there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Les limites de la France sont marquées par la nature, nous les atteindrons des quatre coins de l'horizon, du côté du Rhin, du côté de l'Océan, du côté des Pyrénées, du côté des Alpes. Là doivent finir les bornes de notre République.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===In the Alps===
The [[Army of the Alps]] invaded [[Savoy]], part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] allied with [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and took it with very little resistance between the September 21 and 22, 1792. On October 26, an assembly of Savoyard élites met at [[Chambéry]]. The assembly ceased to recognise [[Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia]] as the sovereign. On October 29, they pronounced the annexation of Savoy to France. This unification was decreed by the Convention on November 17, 1792, and Savoy became the [[département of Mont-Blanc]].
On January 31, 1793, the Convention annexed the [[County of Nice]] and the [[Principality of Monaco]] to form the département of [[Alpes-Maritimes]].

===In Rhineland===
{{main|Left Bank of the Rhine}}
Danton's rhetoric was spread throughout the occupied territories by the representatives of the Convention and the local supporters of the French,{{sfn|Smets|1998|pp=680–681}} in order to prepare and justify the annexation of the territories. Even so, the French were beaten at the [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Battle of Neerwinden]] on March 18, 1793, and were forced to leave Belgium. The decisive French victory at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] in July 1794 and the founding of the [[Batavian Republic]] in January 1795 confirmed the French occupation of Belgium. Prussia started the negotiations that finished with the [[Peace of Basel|first treaty of Basel]], signed April 5, 1795, by which Prussia ceded to France its territories on the left bank of the Rhine.
The [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|victories of Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy]] forced Austria to sign the [[treaty of Campo Formio]] on October 27, 1797. Austria ceded to France all its territories to the west of the Rhine. The French government reorganised the newly enlarged left bank of the Rhine and created four new departments: [[Mont-Tonnerre]], [[Rhin-et-Moselle]], [[Roer (département)|Roer]] and [[Sarre (département)|Sarre]].

===In Belgium===
After the victory at Fleurus, long debates took place at the Convention to decide the fate of the [[Austrian Netherlands]].{{sfn|Smets|1998|pp=689–691}} Pushed by [[Merlin de Douai]], the Convention feared that a separate Belgian republic, along the lines of the Batavian Republic, would be too weak to resist the English and the Austrians, and would become a buffer state against the French republic. The convention finally voted for annexation of Belgium on October 1, 1795, creating the nine Belgian départements: [[Dyle (département)|Dyle]], [[Deux-Nèthes]], [[Escaut (département)|Escaut]], [[Forêts]], [[Jemmape (département)|Jemmape]], [[Lys (département)|Lys]], [[Ourte]], [[Meuse-Inférieure]], and [[Sambre-et-Meuse]]. This annexation was confirmed by the Treaty of Campo Formio, by which the Austrian Empire ceded the Austrian Netherlands to France, followed by the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] in 1801.

==The formation of the Hexagon==
Under the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire]], Napoleon expanded France to its theoretical natural borders through his conquests, mainly with the goal of controlling the coasts. In fact, the war against the [[United Kingdom]] rested partly on the [[Continental System|ban on all commerce with Great Britain]]. In 1812, France had [[130 departments of the First French Empire|130 departments]] (134 including the four departments in [[Catalonia]], which were only partially integrated). France's territory was stretched beyond the Rhine by the annexation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1810), and the north coast of Germany to [[Lübeck]] (1811), beyond the Pyrenees by the annexation of part of Catalonia (1812), and beyond the Alps by the annexation of parts of Italy between 1801 an 1805.
After the first abdication of Napoleon on April 6, 1814, France lost, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], all its territories conquered after 1792. France only kept a small part of Savoy. After [[battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|second Treaty of Paris in 1815]], France was taken back to its 1790 borders and therefore lost Savoy. Savoy and Nice were definitively annexed by France in 1860 by the [[Treaty of Turin]].
The debate over France's borders continued throughout the nineteenth century. [[Jules Michelet]], in his ''History of France'', saw in it a deterministic cause of the history of France. The debate resurged in 1830 at the [[independence of Belgium]] and then between 1871 and 1918, when [[Alsace-Moselle]] was annexed and incorporated by the [[German Empire]].

{{Campaignbox War in the Vendee}}

The '''Machecoul massacre''' is one of the first events of the [[War in the Vendée]], a revolt against [[Levée en masse|mass conscription]] and the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|civil constitution of the clergy]].  The first massacre took place on 11 March 1793, in the provincial city of [[Machecoul]], in the district of the lower [[Loire]].  The city was a thriving center of grain trade; most of the victims were administrators, merchants and citizens of the city.

Although the Machecoul massacre, and others that followed it, are often viewed (variously) as a royalist revolt, or a counter-revolution, twenty-first century historians generally agree that Vendee revolt was a complicated popular event brought on by [[anti-clericalism]] of the Revolution, mass conscription, and [[National Convention#Federalist revolt|Jacobin anti-federalism]].  In the geographic area south of the Loire, resistance to recruitment was particularly intense, and much of this area also resented intrusion by partisans of the republic, called &quot;blue coats&quot;, who brought with them new ideas about district and judicial organization, and who required reorganization of parishes with the so-called juring priests (those who had taken the civil oath).  Consequently, the insurgency became a combination of many impulses, at which conscription and the organization of parishes led the list.  The response to it was incredibly violent on both sides.

==Background==
In 1791, two [[representatives on mission]] informed the [[National Convention]] of the disquieting condition of Vendée, and this news was quickly followed by the exposure of a royalist plot organized by the [[Charles Armand Tuffin, marquis de la Rouerie|Marquis de la Rouerie]]. It was not until the social unrest combined with the external pressures from the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] (1790) and the introduction of a [[Levée en masse#The French Revolutionary Wars|levy]] of 300,000 on the whole of France, decreed by the National Convention in February 1793, that the region erupted.&lt;ref name=Anderson-205&gt;James Maxwell Anderson (2007). ''Daily Life During the French Revolution,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, ISBN 0-313-33683-0. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LWLkLT_hEsQC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wdiRCxv0t9&amp;sig=bUlrxRpKrBWmUkKfS6WBKQuI_LQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result p. 205].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Furet. ''The French Revolution, 1770–1814'', Blackwell Publishing, France, 1996. ISBN 0-631-20299-4.

The Civil Constitution of the Clergy required all clerics to swear allegiance to it and, by extension, to the increasingly anti-clerical [[National Constituent Assembly]]. All but seven of the 160 French bishops refused the oath, as did about half of the parish priests.&lt;ref name=Joes-51&gt;Anthony James Joes,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=buHXFDFdeoQC&amp;dq Resisting Rebellion: The History and Politics of Counterinsurgency], Lexington, University Press of Kentucky, 2006  ISBN 0-8131-2339-9. p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Persecution of the clergy  and [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|of the faithful]] was the first trigger of the rebellion. Those who refused the oath, called non-juring priests, had been exiled or imprisoned. Women on their way to Mass were beaten in the streets. Religious orders had been suppressed and Church property, confiscated.&lt;ref name=Joes-51/&gt; On 3 March 1793, most of the churches were ordered closed. Soldiers confiscated sacramental vessels and the people were forbidden to place crosses on graves.&lt;ref name=Joes-52&gt;Joes, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all the purchasers of church land were [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]; very few peasants benefited from the sales.&lt;ref name=TillyLocal&gt;Charles Tilly, &quot;Local Conflicts in the Vendée before the rebellion of 1793&quot;, &lt;u&gt;French Historical Studies&lt;/u&gt; II, Fall 1961, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; To add to this insult, on 23 February 1793 the Convention required the raising of an additional 300,000 troops from the provinces, an act which enraged the populace,&lt;ref name=Anderson-205/&gt; who took up arms instead as [[Catholic and Royal Army|The Catholic Army]];  the term &quot;Royal&quot; was added later. This army fought first and foremost for the reopening of parish churches with the former priests.&lt;ref name=Jones-52-53&gt;Joes, pp. 52&amp;ndash;53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1793, as word of the conscription requirements filtered into the countryside, many Vendéans  refused to satisfy the decree of the ''levee en masse'' issued on 23 February 1793. Within weeks the rebel forces had formed a substantial, if ill-equipped, army, the ''Royal and Catholic Army'', supported by two thousand [[irregular military|irregular]] [[cavalry]] and a few captured [[artillery]] pieces. Most of the insurgents operated on a much smaller scale, using [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]], supported by the local knowledge and the good-will of the people.&lt;ref name=Hoche&gt;Jonathan North, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_military_history/v067/67.2north.html General Hoche and Counterinsurgency] ''The Journal of Military History'', 67.2 (2003), pp. 529&amp;ndash;540. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massacre==
[[File:Chateau de Machecoul ( de Gilles de Rais ).jpg|thumb|Ruins of the Château de Machecoul where most of the killings occurred.]]
The irregular army raised in the countryside had not reached Machecoul, but the officials from the conscription officers had.  On Monday, 11 March 1793, a crowd arrived in the center of the town, from the surrounding countryside; they started the chant ''Pas de milice'' (no enlistments) and surrounded the Republic's conscription officers in the town.&lt;ref name=TillyLocal/&gt; A nervous soldier opened fire and the enraged crowd retaliated. Between 22 and 26 soldiers were killed, including their lieutenant, Pierre-Claude Ferré.&lt;ref&gt;David Andress, ''The French Revolution and the People,''  London, New York, NY, Hambledon and London, 2004, {{OCLC|59305988}} p. 194 and Graeme Fife, ''The Terror: the shadow of the guillotine, France, 1792&amp;ndash;1794'', New York : St. Martin's Press, 2006. {{OCLC| 70335347}},  pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt;  The immediate victims also included the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy#Jurors and non-jurors|juring]] priest, Pierre Letort, who was bayoneted to death and whose body was mutilated,&lt;ref name=Andress&gt;Andress, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Pagnot the magistrate, and Étienne Gaschignard, the principal of the college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoche&quot;/&gt; The National Guard was routed, and the rebels, including many women, seized those they called &quot;patriots&quot; &amp;mdash;also called the &quot;Blues&quot;, or the people who supported the republican cause&amp;mdash;and led them to prison in the old castle and the convent of [[Congregation of Our Lady of Calvary|Sisters of Cavalry]]. There they killed the guardsmen and some notable inhabitants, about 20 in total, although according to some testimony, as many as 26 were killed on the first day and 18 the next day.  Alfred Lallié, another witness, gave 22 as the count of dead.&lt;ref name=Andress/&gt;

The situation then spiraled out of control. In the following days, the insurgents swelled to some six thousand men and women, and some of the republican adherents and their families fled to [[Nantes]] and other strongholds.  On 19 March, many counter-revolutionary suspects were rounded up and the republicans inflicted their own massacres: in La Rochelle, six non-juring priests were hacked to death and their heads (and other body parts) shown throughout the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andress195&quot;/&gt;  About a week later, the insurgents from Machecoul seized the neighboring harbor town of [[Pornic]] (approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|sp=us}} to the northwest) on 23 March,  this time joined by some of the irregular army that had been forming elsewhere, and sacked it.  A republican patrol surprised the Vendeans, who were carousing on liberated cellars, and killed between 200 and 500 of them.  The angry peasants returned to Machecoul and in reprisal killed another dozen prisoners on 27 March.&lt;ref&gt;Fife, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, about 200 died (not all in the battle), and when the survivors of Pornic returned to Machecoul, they pulled the detained &quot;blue coats&quot; out of the prisoner and shot them, a process that lasted over the next few weeks, into mid-April.&lt;ref name=Andress195&gt;Andress, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Machecoul - Abbaye Notre-Dame-de-la-Chaume (1).jpg|left|thumb|Sisters of Calvary abbey where some of the prisoners were taken.]]

Tales of brutality, some of which may have been true, abounded; numbers of those killed escalated. Current research suggests that 150 were executed in the town overall, but contemporary republican reports put the figure at 500.  Despite the demonization of the insurgents, though, twenty-two &quot;blue coats&quot; from the parish were saved by the request of their own neighborhoods; others were even cleared by tribunals established to monitor executions, and overseen by the local jurist, René François Souchu.&lt;ref name=Andress195/&gt; Souchu, a lawyer and judge by profession, directed the execution of approximately 50 republican officials and adherents on 3 April; they were shot down and buried in a field outside of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Morse Stephens, ''A History of the French Revolution,'' Scribner, 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CEM_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=Rene+Souchu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NxBAVbveE4mYNvvfgIAJ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Rene%20Souchu&amp;f=false p. 261].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary reports===

The most influential of the contemporary reports came from Citizen Boullemer, and was published in over 1000 pamphlets later in the year.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Citizen Boullemer, of Machecoul was a former judge and a crony of the local public prosecutor, Souchu, who escaped the butchery by supporting the insurgency.  Boullemer's recitation of the horrors of the massacre at Machecoul by the so-called brigands, reached the Legislature in late 1793. Fife, p. 108. &lt;/ref&gt; Boullemer claimed to be among the few surviving eyewitnesses: &quot;there arrived from all exits of the city, five to six thousand peasants, women and children, armed [with] guns, scythes, knives, shovels and pikes.  They shouted, running the streets: peace!  peace!&quot; Boullemer's account continues: they descended on Machecoul, confronted a detachment of the National guard that had come to enforce the levy. One hundred National Guardsmen and police defended the town against them. [[Louis-Charles-César Maupassant]], a farmer, merchant and a deputy to the Convention, tried to harangue the attackers into quiescence, but could not be heard above the din.  Most of the Republican troops and officials scattered  before the threatening crowd.  According to Louis Mortimer-Ternaux, another eye-witness, only three officers and five or six [[gendarme]]s remained at their posts.  At that time, according to him, some national guardsmen who had tried to escape through an alley were ambushed by peasants, pursued, and finally brought down by the crowd at the feet of the deputy, Maupassant.  The crowd then pulled him off his horse and killed him with a stroke of a shovel.&lt;ref name=Fife108&gt;Fife, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boullemer's wrote his sensational account well after the fact, in the safety of [[Rennes]], where he was taken after being rescued by republican forces. Boullemer admitted that he had spent most of the six weeks of the upheaval at Machecoul in the safety of his granary, hiding from the peasants. His account of the terror, though lost nothing in the fact that he had seen little: the peasants in the town sounded the [[wikt:tocsin|tocsin]], he wrote, and others exploded from the surrounding fields. Within a short time the entire affair had become a wholesale massacre of republican troops, the constitutional priest, known radical sympathizers and anyone involved with the municipal administration.  Prisoners had their hands tied behind their backs, and were linked with a rope passed under their armpits, in a so-called [[rosary]]; then they were dragged into fields and forced to dig their own graves before being gunned down. Patriots, those who supported the revolution, were hunted down, lashed to trees, and emasculated. Patriot women were raped and cut down in orchards.  Boullemer placed the count of the dead at 552.&lt;ref name=Fife108/&gt;

==View from Paris==
From the Jacobin clubs, the Convention, and the streets and alleyways in Paris, this could only be viewed as insurrection. For them, the Revolution meant a France indivisible.  Anything that divided France&amp;mdash;anything that varied from the path set the revolutionary government&amp;mdash;was dangerous to the success for the revolution itself.  Any idea, an action, or thought that ran counter to the revolutionary ideology smacked of [[federalism]] or, worse, of royalist sentiment. The historians' debate over federalism and the French Revolution reaches almost to the days of the Revolution itself.  To be called a &quot;federalist&quot; in 1793, 1794, or 1795, or any other time in the revolution, for that matter, was tantamount to being labeled as an anti-revolutionary; to be called anti-revolutionary meant one was ''de facto'' a royalist.  It was a convenient epithet: to be called a federalist alienated one from the principal radical goal of the revolution, which was to create a single, unified French Republic.  Any notion of sectionalism&amp;mdash;the possibility that a department or departments could establish for themselves a set of conditions and a government&amp;mdash;must be labeled as anti-revolutionary. For the moderate [[Girondin]]s and the radical [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]], federalism meant the watering-down of the Revolution, the violation of the civic body, and the loss of their dreams. If the peasants of the Vendée did not want to fight ''for'' the Revolution, if they preferred their priests and their (dead) king to their liberty, then they must be ''against'' the Revolution and, consequently, they must be severed from its benefits.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;For an explanation of federalism and the French Revolution, see Paul R. Hanson, ''Jacobin Republic Under Fire: The Federalist Revolt in the French Revolution.'' University Park, Penn State Press, 2003,  {{oclc| 51804615}}, particularly Chapter Four, &quot;The Federalist Program&quot; (pp. 99&amp;ndash;122).&lt;/ref&gt;

This uncompromising vision of revolutionary goals implied a plain and brutal truth: &quot;convert heads or chop them off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fife, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; One deputy complained, &quot;if there were only 30,000, it would be a simple matter of putting them all to the sword, but there are so many!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jonas, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boullemer's written description of the event was published as a  pamphlet in November 1793, and the representative on mission, [[Jacques Garnier]], sent a thousand copies to the Convention, the Executive Council and to all departments; it also served as a basis for the official report that [[François Toussaint Villers]] presented to the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Alain Gérard, ''La Vendee: 1789&amp;ndash;1793.''

==Aftermath==

There were other levy riots across France, when the departments started to draft men into the army in response to the Levy Decree  but reaction in the northwest in March was particularly pronounced with large scale rioting verging on insurrection. By early April, in areas north of the [[Loire]], order had been restored by the revolutionary government, but south of the river, in the four departments that became known as the ''Vendée Militaire'', there were few troops to control rebels and what had started as rioting quickly took on the form of a full insurrection led by priests and the local nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Donald M. G. Sutherland. ''The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order'', Blackwell Publishing France, 2008, ISBN 0-631-23363-6. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-RqlaVNxLxQC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;source=web&amp;ots=d-lvWT6BhC&amp;sig=c8h9bwYQUqWyK-E4h-ObLZYXFHM&amp;hl=en p. 155].&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence links these events to local dissatisfaction with the reorganization of the church into a government entity.  The unrest began half way through [[Lent]]; [[Easter]] that year occurred on 31 March 1793, and, significantly, the initial violence was directed at the local priest Letort.  Letort personified the revolution, and the republican government in Paris by taking the Civil Oath of the Clergy, essentially becoming a puppet of the republicans in Paris, at least in the eyes of the insurgents. The violence followed what Raymond Jonas called a singular pattern of logic: it targeted those who personified the revolution in their function or status:  National Guard Lieutenant Ferré, such prominent townsmen as Deputy Maupassant, and the constitutional priest Letort.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Anthony Jonas, ''France and the Cult of the Sacred Heart,'' University of California Press, 2000, {{OCLC|49570126}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the local district administrator, the jurist Souchu, was left alone: apparently he was known for his anti-republican sentiments and actually threw his lot in with the insurgents.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Souchu was captured in mid-April by republican troops and immediately executed.  Gérard, pp. 134–136.  Apparently, as republican troops approached Machecoul, he donned a red liberty cap and rushed out to greet the army, claiming he had been held against his will.  Someone denounced him and he was summarily killed. David Bell, ''The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It'', NY, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; After the furor in Machecoul died down later in the spring, the former pastor at Machecoul, the non-juring priest François Priou, refused to celebrate at the now &quot;liberated&quot; church because the schismatic constitutional priest had profaned it. Instead, he said the Mass outside on a makeshift altar.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class differences were not as great in the [[Vendée]] as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local [[nobility]] seems to have been more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France.&lt;ref name=Schama589&gt;[[Simon Schama]], [[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution|Citizens]], Penguin Books, 2004, ISBN 0141017279, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=Schama589/&gt;

==Revolutionary terror and Marxism==
In his article, ''The Victory of the Counter-Revolution in Vienna'', ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', No. 136, 7 November 1848, [[Karl Marx]] wrote: “… there is only one means to shorten, simplify and concentrate the murderous death throes of the old society and the bloody birth pangs of the new, only ''one means'' – ''revolutionary terrorism''&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx – Friedrich Engels – Werke, Berlin: Dietz Verlag, Vol. V, 1959, pp. 455-7. [http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me05/me_05_455.htm]; for English translation see [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; (the term terrorism, here, not to be confused with the modern meaning of the term, but rather having the same meaning as the word terror in the sense in which it is used in this article).

[[Edvard Radzinsky]], a Russian author of popular history books, in his biography of [[Joseph Stalin]] noted that Stalin wrote a ''[[nota bene]]'' — &quot;Terror is the quickest way to new society&quot; — beside the above passage in a book by [[Karl Kautsky]].&lt;ref name=Radzinsky&gt;[[Edvard Radzinsky]] ''Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives'', Anchor, (1997) ISBN 0-385-47954-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kautsky, ''Terrorism and Communism'' (1919), Ch. V. The book is item F558 O3 D90, one of two books on terror from Stalin’s private library, seen by Edvard Radzinsky (''Stalin'', 1996, pp. 150, 569).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]] and other leading [[Bolshevik]] ideologists recognized mass terror as a necessary weapon during the [[dictatorship of proletariat]] and the resulting [[class struggle]]. Thus, in his ''The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky'' (1918), Lenin wrote: “One cannot hide the fact that dictatorship presupposes and implies a “condition”, one so disagreeable to renegades [such as Kautsky], of ''revolutionary violence'' of one class against another … the “fundamental feature” of the concept of dictatorship of the proletariat is revolutionary violence.”

Similarly, in his book &quot;''Defence of Terrorism''&quot; (''Terrorism and Communism'', 1920) Trotsky emphasized that &quot;...the historical tenacity of the bourgeoisie is colossal... We are forced to tear off this class and chop it away. The Red Terror is a weapon used against a class that, despite being doomed to destruction, does not want to perish.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Black book of Communism&quot;, page 749&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, they opposed [[individual terror]], which has been used earlier by the [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|People's Will]] organization. According to Trotsky, &quot;The damaging of machines by workers, for example, is terrorism in this strict sense of the word. The killing of an employer, a threat to set fire to a factory or a death threat to its owner, an assassination attempt, with revolver in hand, against a government minister—all these are terrorist acts in the full and authentic sense. However, anyone who has an idea of the true nature of international Social Democracy ought to know that it has always opposed ''this kind'' of terrorism and does so in the most irreconcilable way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Trotsky 1911&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1911/11/tia09.htm|title=Why Marxists Oppose Individual Terrorism|publisher=[[Marxists.org]]|author=[[Leon Trotsky]]|date=November 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many later [[Marxist]]s, in particular [[Karl Kautsky]], criticized Bolshevik leaders for terrorism tactics. He stated that &quot;among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, Terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terrorism and Communism&quot;&gt;[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 Terrorism and Communism] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins, evolution and history==
German Social Democrat [[Karl Kautsky]] traces the origins of revolutionary terror to the &quot;[[Reign of Terror]]&quot; of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kautsky&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/index.htm |title=Terrorism and Communism |author=[[Karl Kautsky]] |year=1919 |chapter=Revolution and Terror |chapterurl=http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch01.htm |quote=Kautsky said: &quot;It is, in fact, a widely spread idea that Terrorism belongs to the very essence of revolution, and that whoever wants a revolution must somehow come to some sort of terms with terrorism.

==Soviet Union==
[[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]] and other leading [[Bolshevik]] ideologists promulgated mass terror as a necessary weapon during the [[dictatorship of proletariat]] and the resulting [[class struggle]]. In his book &quot;''Defence of Terrorism''&quot;  Trotsky emphasized that &quot;...the historical tenacity of the bougeoisie is colossal... We are forced to tear off this class and chop it away. The Red Terror is a weapon used against a class that, despite being doomed to destruction, does not want to perish.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, they opposed to [[individual terror]], which has been used earlied by [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Russian &quot;People's Will]] organization. According to Trotsky, &quot;The damaging of machines by workers, for example, is terrorism in this strict sense of the word. The killing of an employer, a threat to set fire to a factory or a death threat to its owner, an assassination attempt, with revolver in hand, against a government minister—all these are terrorist acts in the full and authentic sense. However, anyone who has an idea of the true nature of international Social Democracy ought to know that it has always opposed ''this kind'' of terrorism and does so in the most irreconcilable way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Trotsky 1911&quot;/&gt;

Many later marxists, in particular [[Karl Kautsky]], criticized [[Bolshevik]] leaders for terrorism tactics. He stated that &quot;among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, Terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terrorism and Communism&quot;/&gt; Kautsky recognized that [[Red Terror]] represented a variety of [[terrorism]] because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population, and included taking and executing [[hostage]]s. People were executed simply for who they were, not for their deeds.
&lt;!-- already in body above [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote a ''[[nota bene]]'' &quot;Terror is the quickest way to new society&quot; beside this passage in a book by Marx &lt;ref name=&quot;Radzinsky&quot;&gt;[[Edvard Radzinsky]].

This and similar types of pronouncements by Communist leaders have led many historians to conclude that despotism, violent persecution, repression and intolerance were intrinsic drives in Communist regimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pipes&quot;&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] Communism: A History (2001) ISBN 0-8129-6864-6, pages 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Purge]] refers collectively to several related campaigns of [[political repression]] and [[persecution]] in the [[Soviet Union]] orchestrated by [[Joseph Stalin]] during the 1930s, which removed all of his remaining opposition from power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Social Catastrophe&quot;&gt;Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe.

Knopf. 720 pages ISBN 1-4000-4005-1&lt;/ref&gt; It involved the [[purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the persecution of unaffiliated persons, both occurring within a period characterized by omnipresent police surveillance, widespread suspicion of &quot;saboteurs&quot;, imprisonment, and killings. In the [[Western World]], this was referred to as &quot;the Great Terror&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8625">The '''Bignon Commission''' ({{lang-fr|commission Bignon}}; 1793–1794) was a [[First French Republic|French]] military tribunal that [[French Terror|terrorized]] [[Nantes]] during the [[French Revolution]]. The president of the tribunal was [[Antoine Gonchon]] but it came to be known after [[François Bignon]], captain of the 2nd battalion of Paris Volunteers, who directed most of its proceedings.

During the [[Reign of Terror]], the radicals had little trust in their revolutionary committees who acted as a leadership group. With living conditions and hunger still an issue even after [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s death, the people were unsatisfied with the new leadership in the committees and often times, they were fearful of the committees. As a result, counter-revolutionary groups formed. These counter-revolutionaries believed that they were following the true ideals of the revolution, while the committees saw them as a threat instead. While some counter-revolutionaries were trained, groups such as the [[Vendée]] mostly used [[guerrilla warfare]] as a tactic to fight. The [[Vendée]] were responsible for many revolts and as a result, they caused a big uproar.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Terror in the French Revolution|last=Gough|first=Hugh|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-20181-1|location=London|pages=41–42|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generals of the [[Vendée]] often clashed with the leaders of the Committee of Public Safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The creation of military commissions such as the Bignon Commission were intended to stop counter-revolutionary groups from rallying support and inciting violence. By ending rebellious behavior, the goal was to ultimately unite the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] once again.

== The Vendée/ the Vendéans ==
The [[Vendée|Vendé]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e were a counter-revolutionary group who were seen as a threat to the [[French Revolution]]. Any group that appeared to not believe in the true ideals of the revolution were considered counter-revolutionary, and during the [[Reign of Terror]], many were quickly tried and often sentenced to death. In this way, the Committee of Public Safety only acted against them because they were seen as a big enough threat to the revolution. As a result, military commissions were created, such as the Bignon Commission to stop groups like the [[Vendée]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tragic Episodes of the French Revolution in Brittany with Unpublished Documents|last=Lenotre|first=G.|publisher=Ballantyne, Hanson &amp; Co.|year=1912|isbn=|location=London|pages=28|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee of Public Safety felt that their rebellious nature had to be suppressed before it spread to the general public. The [[Vendée]] was a violent group, as they revolted in massacres and attacks against the Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France|last=Andress|first=David|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2005|isbn=978-0-374-27341-5|location=New York|pages=244–246|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vendée]] were a group of pious individuals who typically practiced guerilla warfare in their attacks. They were against the Republic and the committees.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; They generally did not keep [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], nor did they want to kill them. They would often set their prisoners free even if it was the republican enemy. In fact, Charles-Melchior de Bonchamps ordered that 5,000 republican [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] be set free.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

== The Creation of Military Commissions ==
Military commissions were created October 9, 1792.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Longman Companion to the French Revolution|last=Jones|first=Collin|publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-582-49417-6|location=New York|pages=114|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were five judges which consisted of everyday people or soldiers. People who were tried were sentenced to death. These military commissions were initially created to put [[Émigré|emigres]] on trial, but by March 19, 1793 the law changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Rebels who had weapons or other political counter-revolutionaries were put on trial under the military commissions which is similar to a criminal court today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; However, since the people who were tried were considered to be political radicals and a threat to the [[French Revolution]], they were tried quickly and few were actually put in prison; the majority of the people tried were killed.

The Bignon Commission was one military commission created among 60 others that was intended to catch the rebels who were accused of counter-revolutionary behavior and later who had fled out of fear during the [[Reign of Terror]]. They were intended to be tried quickly and then sentenced to death. There were 8,000 people executed, and it was based off of judicial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ending the French Revolution: Violence, Justice, and Repression from the Terror to Napoleon|last=Brown|first=Howard G.|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8139-2729-9|location=|pages=393|quote=|via=footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accused were not allowed to have a lawyer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The military officials and citizens were able to act as judges and the court decisions had to be made immediately. Others such as the Brutus and Frey Commissions, and the Parien and Felix Commissions, executed many people, but the Lenoir and Bignon Commissions were responsible for the most deaths, counting at 4,000 in [[Nantes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

By April 1794, the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris was in charge of handling counter-revolutionary cases by law.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tees.ac.uk/schools/lahs/rev_france/frenrev/resource/21a(iii).htm|title=© The Incidence of the Terror during the French Revolution|website=www.tees.ac.uk|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any local commission or tribunal that was once able to trial [[Émigré|emigres]], rebels, or [[clergy]] were no longer granted that power unless the [[Committee of Public Safety]] gave them the right to do so. This decision helped to put an end to the [[Reign of Terror]] in suppression of tribunals and military commissions such as the Bignon Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In the last months of the [[Reign of Terror]], the remaining executions occurred in places such as [[Bordeaux]], [[Nîmes]] and [[Arras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;   
[[File:SavenayDrownings.jpg|thumb|390x390px|On December 23, 1793, the first battle in the War of the Vendee took place. The Bignon Commission was responsible for many deaths after the [[Battle of Savenay]].

== Executions ==
The [[Reign of Terror]] caused great fear and distrust of the committees because of their power in the swift creation of military commissions to shut down counter-revolutionary groups. Many people felt that the military commissions were unjust and were too violent and the power that the committees had was too much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living the French Revolution: 1789-1799|last=McPhee|first=Peter|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2006|isbn=978-0-230-57475-5|location=New York|pages=163–164|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quick trials and the sudden mass executions contributed to the fear of the time period.

Once counter-revolutionaries such as the [[Vendée|Vendéans]] were captured, they were given a swift trial and the majority were executed. Most people were executed by [[shooting range]]s, including girls as young at 17. By 1794, about eighty people were killed per day. Many people were also [[Drowning|drowned]]. People were tied together, herded on boats, and then drowned in packs. No records were kept of this event.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Alongside the commissions, the local militia supported the initiative. For example, the Marat Company was able to execute large groups of people with [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]]’s support, who was in favor of quick execution in order to free more prison space for radicals and anyone else against the ideals of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The '''ministers of the French National Convention''' were appointed on 10 August 1792 after the French [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] suspended King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and revoked the ministers that he had named.{{sfn|Muel|1891|p=25}}

On 12 Germinal year II (1 April 1794) [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed to suppress the executive council and the six ministers, replacing the ministers with twelve [[Commissioners of the Committee of Public Safety|Committees]] reporting to the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. The proposal was unanimously adopted by the National Convention.{{sfn|Muel|1891|p=41-42}}

The '''Lumières''' (literally in English: ''Enlighteners'') was a cultural, philosophical, literary and intellectual movement of the second half of the 18th century, originating in France and spreading throughout Europe. It included philosophers such as [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Pierre Bayle]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Over time it came to mean the {{lang|fr|''Siècle des Lumières''}}, in English the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot; name=&quot;definition&quot;/&gt;

Members of the movement saw themselves as a progressive élite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, [[obscurantism]] and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revolution-francaise.net/2006/07/07/56-contre-nous-de-la-tyrannie-des-relations-ideologiques-entre-lumieres-et-revolution-par-josiane-boulad-ayoub|title=Contre nous de la tyrannie...

Ces pensées influenceront les révolutionnaires français de 1789.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumières movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe, and was almost exclusively a development of the ideas of [[Renaissance humanism]]. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of &quot;enlightenment&quot; had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.

In the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over [[faith]] and [[belief]]; in politics and economics, the triumph of the [[bourgeois]] over [[nobility]] and [[clergy]].

==== Advances in scientific method ====

Truth radiates light; on the right, Reason and Philosophy try to capture it. 1772 engraving by [[Benoît-Louis Prévost]], from a drawing by [[Charles Nicolas Cochin]].]]

The Lumières movement was in large part an extension of the discoveries of [[Nicolas Copernicus]] in the 16th century, which were not well known during his lifetime, and more so of the theories of [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1642). Inquiries to establish certain [[axiom]]s and [[mathematical proof]]s continued as [[Cartesianism]] throughout the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]] (1646&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1716) and [[Isaac Newton]] (1642&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1727) had independently and almost simultaneously developed the [[calculus]], and [[René Descartes]] (1596&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1650) the idea of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]]. British philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume]] adopted an approach, later called [[empiricism]], which preferred the use of the [[senses]] and [[experience]] over that of [[pure reason]].

[[Baruch Spinoza]] took Descartes' side, most of all in his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|language=fr|first1=Franc̜ois|last1=Pillon|author1link=|journal=L'Année philosophique|title=Bibliothèque de philosophie contemporaine|editor-first=Félix|editor-last=Alcan|place=Paris|day=|month=|year=1903|volume=13|page=257|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MnVKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he demurred from Descartes in ''{{lang|la|[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione]]}}'' (&quot;On the Improvement of the Understanding&quot;), where he argued that the process of [[perception]] is not one of pure reason, but also the senses and [[intuition]]. Spinoza's thought was based on a model of the universe where God and Nature are one and the same. This became an anchor in the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=Antoine Eugène|last1=Genoude|author1link=|title=La Raison du christianisme, ou, Preuves de la verité de la religion tirées des écrits des plus grands hommes de la France, de l'Angleterre et de l'Allemagne|trans-title=Christian Reason, or, Thoughts on the Truth of Religion, by the Greatest Writers in France, England and Germany|publisher=Pourrat Frères|place=Paris|year=1836|chapter=2|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; held across the ages from Newton's time to that of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s (1743&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1826).

A notable change was the emergence of a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist philosophy]], spreading across Europe, embodied by Newton. The [[scientific method]] &amp;ndash; exploring experimental evidence and constructing consistent theories and axiom systems from observed phenomena &amp;ndash; was undeniably useful. The predictive ability of its resulting theories set the tone for his masterwork ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687). As an example of scientific progress in the [[Age of Reason]] and the Lumières movement, Newton's example remains unsurpassed, in taking observed facts and constructing a theory which explains them [[A priori knowledge|a priori]], for example taking the motions of the planets observed by [[Johannes Kepler]] to confirm [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|his law of universal gravitation]]. Naturalism saw the unification of pure [[empiricism]] as practiced by the likes of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] with the axiomatic, &quot;pure reason&quot; approach of Descartes.

Belief in an intelligible world ordered by a Christian God became the crux of philosophical investigations of knowledge. On one side, religious philosophy concentrated on [[piety]], and the omniscience and ultimately mysterious nature of God; on the other were ideas such as [[deism]], underpinned by the impression that the world was comprehensible by human reason and that it was governed by universal physical laws. God was imagined as a &quot;Great Watchmaker&quot;; experimental [[natural philosopher]]s found the world to be more and more ordered, even as machines and measuring instruments became ever more sophisticated and precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=J. S.|last1=Flotte|author1link=|title=Leçons élémentaires de philosophie|chapter=|publisher=Brunot-Labbé|place=Paris|day=|month=|year=1819|volume=2|page=226|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwg-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q=Dieu%20Grand%20Horloger&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous French natural philosopher of the 18th Century, [[Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon]], was critical of this natural theology in his masterwork ''[[Histoire Naturelle]]''. Buffon rejected the idea of ascribing to [[Miracle|divine intervention]] and the &quot;supernatural&quot; that which science could now explain. This criticism brought him up against the [[Sorbonne]] which, dominated by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], never stopped trying to censor him. In 1751, he was ordered to redact some propositions contrary to the teaching of the Church; having proposed 74,000 years for the [[age of the Earth]], this was contrary to the Bible which, using the scientific method on data found in [[biblical concordance]]s, dated it to around 6,000 years.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} &lt;!-- true but not part of the translation. Can quote Orwell quoting his concordance, that it was 4,004 BC at 3 oçlock in the afternoon --&gt; The Church was also hostile to his no less illustrious contemporary [[Carl von Linné]], and some have concluded that the Church simply refused to believe that order existed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yves|last=Zarka|first2=Marie-France|last2=Germain|url=http://www.bouquineo.fr/products/buffon-le-naturaliste-philosophe-1|title=Buffon, le naturaliste philosophe|publisher=Chemins de tr@verse|year=2014|accessdate=30 October 2015|isbn=978-2-313-00466-1|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individual liberty and the social contract ====
This effort to research and elucidate universal laws, and to determine their component parts, also became an important element in the construction of a philosophy of [[individualism]], where everyone had rights based only on [[fundamental human rights]]. There developed the philosophical notion of the thoughtful [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], an individual who could make decisions based on pure reason and no longer in the yoke of custom. In ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', [[John Locke]] argued that [[property rights]] are not held in common but are totally personal, and made legitimate by the work required to obtain the property, as well as its protection (recognition) by others. Once the idea of [[natural law]] is accepted, it becomes possible to form the modern view of what we would now call [[political economy]].

In his famous essay ''[[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]'' ({{lang-de|Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?}}, {{lang-fr|Qu'est-ce que les Lumières ?}}), [[Emmanuel Kant]] defined the Lumières thus:
{{quote|{{lang|fr|''Les Lumières c’est la sortie de l’homme hors de l’état de tutelle dont il est lui-même responsable. L’état de tutelle est l’incapacité de se servir de son entendement sans la conduite d’un autre. On est soi-même responsable de cet état de tutelle quand la cause tient non pas à une insuffisance de l’entendement mais à une insuffisance de la résolution et du courage de s’en servir sans la conduite d’un autre. ''{{lang|la|Sapere aude !}}'' Aie le courage de te servir de ton propre entendement ! Tel est la devise des Lumières.''}}

Enlightenment is the release of man from a state of bondage for which he is himself responsible. In this state of bondage he is unable to fulfill his intentions without the help of another. He is himself responsible for this bondage, where the cause is not a lack of understanding but a lack of resolution and courage to use it unguided. ''{{lang|la|Sapere Aude!}}'' Have the courage to use your own understanding! Such is the motto of the Lumières.}}

The Lumières' philosophy was thus based on the realities of a systematic, ordered and understandable world, which required Man also to think in an ordered and systematic way. As well as physical laws, this included ideas on the laws governing human affairs and the [[divine right of kings]], leading to the idea that the monarch acts with the consent of the people, and not the other way around. This legal concept informed [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s theory of the [[social contract]] as a reciprocal relationship between men, and more so between families and other groups, which would become increasingly stronger, accompanied by a concept of individual inalienable rights. The powers of God were moot amongst atheist Lumières.

Le Lumières movement redefined the ideas of liberty, property and rationalism, which took on meanings that we still understand today, and introduced into political philosophy the idea of the free individual, liberty for all guaranteed by the State (and not the whim of the government) backed by a strong [[rule of law]].

To understand the interaction between the Age of Reason and the Lumières, one approach is to compare [[Thomas Hobbes]] with [[John Locke]]. Hobbes, who lived for three quarters of the 17th century, had worked to create an ontology of human emotions, ultimately trying to make order out of an inherently chaotic universe. In the alternate, Locke saw in Nature a source of unity and universal rights, with the State's assurance of protection. This &quot;culture revolution&quot; over the 17th and 18th centuries was a battle between these two viewpoints of the relationship between Man and Nature.

This resulted, in France, in the spread of the notion of human rights, finding expression in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which greatly influenced similar declarations of rights in the following centuries, and left in its wake global political upheaval. Especially in France and the United States, [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of thought]] were held to be fundamental rights.

=== Social values and manifests ===
[[File:Rousseau.jpg|thumb|150px|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]

==== Representation of the people ====
The core values supported by the Lumières were [[religious tolerance]], liberty and [[social equality]].
In England, America and France, the application of these values resulted in a new definition of [[natural law]] and a separation of [[political power]]. To these values may be added a love of nature and the cult of reason.
{{quote|{{lang|fr|''Aujourd’hui nous recevons trois éducations différentes ou contraires : celles de nos pères, celles de nos maîtres, celle du monde. Ce qu’on nous dit dans la dernière renverse toutes les idées des premières.''}}&lt;br/&gt;Today we receive three different, conflicting, educations: those of our fathers, those of our masters, and those of the world. It is only when we know the last that we can reject the first two.|[[Montesquieu]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L’Esprit des lois (part I)|language=fr|volume=4|chapter=IV. Différence des effets de l’éducation chez les Anciens et parmi nous|trans-title=Difference of the Effects of Education among the Ancients and Ourselves|last=Montesquieu|authorlink=Montesquieu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Philosophical goals ====
[[File:Histoiredesdeuxindes.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover of Raynal's ''[[Histoire des deux Indes]]'', an encyclopaedia of 18th-century anticolonialism]]
The ideal figure of the Lumières was a philosopher, a [[man of letters]] with a social function of exercising his reason in all domains to guide his and others' conscience, to advocate a [[value system]] and use it in discussing the problems of the time. He is a committed individual, involved in [[society]], an {{lang|fr|''honnête homme qui agit en tout par raison''}} (''[[Encyclopédie]]''; &quot;Honest man who approaches everything with reason&quot;), {{lang|fr|''qui s’occupe à démasquer des erreurs''}} ([[Diderot]], &quot;Who concerns himself with revealing error&quot;).

The rationalism of the Lumières was not to the exclusion of aesthetics. Reason and [[Feeling|sentiment]] went hand-in-hand in their philosophy. The thoughts of the Lumières were equally capable of intellectual rigour and sentimentality.

Despite controversy about the limits of their philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Sala-Molins|title=Le Code Noir ou le calvaire de Caanan|language=fr|place=Paris|publisher=PUF|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Sala-Molins|title=Les misères des Lumières; sous la raison l'outrage''|place=Paris|publisher=Flammarion|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when they denounced black [[slavery]], many Lumières criticised slavery, or [[colonialism]], or both, including [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[De l'Esprit des Lois]]'' (while keeping a &quot;personal&quot; slave), [[Denis Diderot]] in ''[[Supplément au voyage de Bougainville]]'', [[Voltaire]] in ''[[Candide]]'' and [[Guillaume-Thomas Raynal]] in his encyclopaedic ''[[Histoire des deux Indes]]'', the very model of 18th-century [[anticolonialism]] to which, among others, Diderot and [[Paul Henri Thiry d'Holbach|d’Holbach]] contributed. It was stated without any proof that one of their number, [[Voltaire]], had shares in the [[slave trade]].

==== Encyclopaedic goals ====
At the time, there was a particular taste for compendia of &quot;all knowledge&quot;. This ideal found an instance in Diderot and d'Alembert's {{lang|fr|''Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers''}} (&quot;Encyclopaedia, or Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts&quot;), usually known simply as the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. Published between 1750 and 1770 it aimed to lead people out of ignorance through the widest dissemination of knowledge.

=== Criticism ===
The Lumières movement was, for all its existence, pulled in two directions by opposing social forces: on one side, a strong [[spiritualism]] accompanied by a traditional faith in the religion of the Church; on the other, the rise of an [[anticlerical]] movement, critical of the differences between religious theory and practice, which was most manifest in France.

Anticlericism was not the only source of tension in France: some noblemen contested monarchical power and the upper classes wanted to see greater fruit from their labours. A relaxing of morals fomented opinion against absolutism and the Ancient Order. According to Dale K. Van Kley, [[Jansenism]] in France also became a source of division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=Dale K.|last1=Van Kley|author1link=|title=Les Origines religieuses de la Révolution française, 1560-1791|publisher=Seuil|volume=|isbn=9782020855099|url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French judicial system showed itself to be outdated. Even though commercial law had become codified during the 17th century, there was no uniform, or codified, civil law.

==== Voltaire ====
[[File:voltaire.jpg|thumb|150px|Voltaire ([[Circa|c.]] 1745) by the school of [[Nicolas de Largillière]]]]
This social and legal background was criticised in works by the likes of [[Voltaire]]. Exiled in [[England]] between 1726 and 1729, he studied the works of John Locke and Isaac Newton, and the English monarchy. He became well known for his denunciation of injustices such as those against [[Jean Calas]], [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], [[François-Jean de la Barre]] and [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally]].

The Lumières philosophy saw its climax in the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|langue=|first1=Patrick|last1=Cabanel|author1link=Patrick Cabanel|first2=|last2=|author2link=|title=Histoire de France, 1750-1995|chapter=Monarchies et républiques|publisher=Presses Univ. du Mirail|lien publisher=|place=Toulouse|day=|month=|year=|volume=1|page=27|isbn=9782858162741|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5i9J2iRbkcC&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Voltaire, it was obvious that if the monarch can get the people to believe unreasonable things, then he can get them to ''do'' unreasonable things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Impie|title=Dictionnaire philosophique}}&lt;/ref&gt; This axiom became the basis for his criticism of the Lumières, and led to the basis of [[romanticism]]: that constructions from pure reason created as many problems as they solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Bénichou|title=L'École du désenchantement. Sainte-Beuve, Nodier, Musset, Nerval, Gautier|place=Paris|publisher=Gallimard|year=1992|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lumières philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lise|last=Andriès|title=Le Partage des savoirs XVIIIeme-XIXeme siecles|chapter= Littérature et idéologies|language=fr|place=Lyon|publisher=Presses Universitaires de Lyon|year=2003|isbn=9782729707330}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crucial point of intellectual progress consisted of the synthesis of knowledge, enlightened by human reason, with the creation of a sovereign moral authority. A contrary point of view that developed, arguing that such a process would be swayed by social conventions, leading to a &quot;New Truth&quot; based on reason that was but a poor imitation of the ideal and unassailable truth.

The Lumières movement thus tried to find a balance between the idea of a &quot;natural&quot; liberty (or autonomy) and the freedom ''from'' that liberty, that is to say, the recognition that the autonomy found in nature was at odds with the discipline required for pure reason. At the same time, with various monarchs' reforms, there was a piecemeal attempt to redefine the order of society, and the relationship between monarch and subjects. The idea of a natural order was equally prevalent in scientific thought, for example, in the works of the biologist [[Carl von Linné]].

==== Kant ====
In [[Germany]], [[Emmanuel Kant]] (like Rousseau, defining himself among the Lumières) heavily criticised the limitations of pure reason in his work ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' ({{lang-de|Kritik der reinen Vernunft}}), but also that of English empiricism in ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' ({{lang-de|Kritik der praktischen Vernunft}}). Compared with the rather subjective [[metaphysics]] of Descartes, Kant developed a more objective viewpoint in this branch of philosophy.

==== Adam Smith ====
Great thinkers at the end of the Lumières movement ([[Adam Smith]], Thomas Jefferson and even the young [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]) adopted into their philosophy the ideas of self-organising and evolutionary forces. The Lumières' stance was then presented with reference to what was seen as a universal truth: that Good is fundamental in nature, but it is not self-evident. On the contrary, it is the advance of human reason that reveals this constant structure. [[Romanticism]] is the exact opposite of this stance.

=== Aestheticism ===
{{POV section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Boullée - Projet d'Opéra - élévation.jpg|thumb|150px|Redevelopment of the [[Opéra de Paris]] by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], 1781]]

Plus le siècle s’avance, plus la littérature et l’art répudient la gratuité des formes, la légèreté, regardées comme aristocratiques et mondaines, pour aller vers le sérieux, l’authentique et le naturel, c’est-à-dire vers ce qui est conforme à la morale utilitaire du public bourgeois d’où le goût croissant pour le néoclassicisme, qui met en avant l’antique, non pas l’antique allégorique de l’époque classique mais un antique historique plus sobre, à la façon du peintre David''}}

{{quote|
In its general view, the aestheticism of the Lumières took on a moral aspect, the times of Voltaire's satire had passed, and Rousseau (in ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' of 1776) and the paintings of [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] sought the beautiful and the everlasting. As the century grew older, more literature and art turned its back on free forms and a lightness of touch, regarding them as aristocratic and worldly. They turned towards the serious, the authentic and the natural, that fit the utilitarian morality of the bourgeois public whose taste was for neoclassicism: still having antiquity as subject-matter, but not the allegorical antiquity; a more realistic, sober antiquity, such as in the works of the painter [[Jacques-Louis David]].
}}

This resulted in reflections about [[urbanism]]. The Lumières' model town would be a joint effort between public provision and sympathetic architects, to create administrative or utilitarian buildings (town halls, hospitals, theatres, commisariats) all provided with views, squares, fountains, promenades, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=L.|last=Hautecoeur|title=Histoire de l'architecture classique en France|volume=III, IV|date=1950–1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The French [[Académie royale d'architecture]] was of the opinion that {{lang|fr|''le beau est ce qui plait''}} (&quot;The beautiful is the pleasant&quot;). For [[Abbé Laugier]], on the contrary, the beautiful was that which was in line with rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laugier|first=Marc-Antoine|title=Essai sur l'architecture|place=Paris|date=1753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural model for all architecture was the log cabin supported by four tree trunks, with four horizontal parts and a roof, respectively [[column (architecture)|columns]], [[entablature]], and [[pediment]]s. The model of a [[Greek temple]] was thus extended into the décor and the structure. This paradigm resulted in a change of style in the middle of the 18th century: [[Rococo]] was dismissed, [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Palladian architecture]] became the principal references for [[neoclassical architecture]].

[[File:UVa Rotunda.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The rotunda of the [[University of Virginia]], designed by Thomas Jefferson.]]
The [[University of Virginia]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], was founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]]. He drew up plans for parts of the campus based on the values of the Lumières.

The [[Place Stanislas]] at [[Nancy, France]] is the focus of an array of neoclassical urban buildings, and has been on the UNESCO [[List of World Heritage Sites in France]] since 1983, as well as several other sites in the town, such as the [[Place de la Carrière]] and the [[Place d’Alliance]], the administrative centre of the time.

[[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]] (1736&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1806) was a member of the Académie d'Architecture was without doubt the architect whose projects best represented the utopian, purely rational environment. (That which is rational, and thus based in the understanding of nature, cannot be at the same time utopian.) Starting in 1775 he built the [[Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans]], a very industrial city in [[Doubs]].

The bourgeosie had learned nothing from the Lumières, even though they saw Rousseau, Montesquieu and Kant as honest men who approved of the &quot;élite&quot;: a vague concept, and one of which the Lumières amongst others disapproved.{{cite book|title=Le Discours sur la Servitude Volontaire|first=Étienn|last=de La Boétie}}

There was considerable coverage in the English and French Press, but less so in Germany and Italy; in Spain and Russia very few knew about it save a few intellectuals, senior officials and grand families participated in the movement. The mass of the people could not care less: the vast majority of the common people, even in France, had never heard of Voltaire or Rousseau.

Nevertheless, the Lumières had disrupted the old certainties. This did not stop at social and political upheaval: the Enlightenment inspired a revolutionary generation, which is not to say they explicitly encouraged the [[French Revolution of 1789]].

As [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]], the philosophers of the Lumières movement&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot; name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;In French, the term {{lang|fr|''Lumières''}} (as a collective noun) is used to designate the free-thinkers, writers and philosophers who embraced a particular philosophy; it might be regarded as an abuse of language to use it to refer to the philosophy itself.&lt;/ref&gt; came with many different talents: [[Thomas Jefferson]] had had a legal education but was equally at home with [[archaeology]] and [[architecture]]; [[Benjamin Franklin]] had been a career diplomat and was a physicist. Condorcet wrote on subjects as wide-ranging as commerce, finance, education and science.

The social origins of the philosophers were also diverse: many were from middle-class families (Voltaire, Jefferson), others from more modest beginnings ([[Emmanuel Kant]], Franklin, Diderot) or from the nobility (Montesquieu, Condorcet). Some had had a religious education (Diderot, [[Louis de Jaucourt]]) or one in the law (Montesquieu, Jefferson).

The philosophers formed networks and communicated in letters; the vitriolic correspondence between Rousseau and Voltaire is well known.{{who|date=November 2015}} The great figures of the 18th century met and debated in the salons, cafés or [[Academy#Literary-philosophical academies|academies]]. These thinkers and {{lang|fr|''savants''}} formed an international community. Franklin, Jefferson, [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Ferdinando Galiani]] all spent many years in France.

Because they criticised the established order, the philosophers were chased by the authorities and had to resort to subterfuge to escape prison. François-Marie Arouet took on the pseudonym Voltaire. In 1774, Thomas Jefferson wrote a report on behalf of the Virginia delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]], which was convened to discuss the grievances of [[Great Britain]]'s American colonies. Because its content, he could only publish it anonymously. Diderot's {{lang|fr|''Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient''}} (&quot;[[Letter on the Blind|Letter on the Blind for the Use of those who can See]]&quot;)  landed him in prison at the [[Château de Vincennes]].&lt;!-- French says [[Fort de Vincennes]] which is the ''New'' fort in both FR and EN; this is not right, since it wasn't built then. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Gamarra|authorlink=Pierre Gamarra|language=fr|title=L&quot;Histoire de la laïcité|place=Paris|publisher=IDLivre|date=2005|isbn=2747900576|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire was accused of writing pamphlets criticising [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] (1674-1723), and imprisoned in the [[Bastille]]. in 1721, Montesquieu published ''{{lang|fr|Lettres persanes}}'' (&quot;[[Persian Letters]]&quot;) anonymously in [[Holland]]. From 1728 to 1734, he went to many European countries.

Faced with [[censorship]] and in financial difficulty, the philosophers often resorted to the protection of aristocrats and patrons: [[Chrétien Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes]] and [[Madame de Pompadour]], chief mistress of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], supported Diderot. [[Marie-Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin]] (1699&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1777) paid part of the publishing costs of the ''Encyclopédie''. From 1749 to 1777 she held a fortnightly {{lang|fr|''salon''}}, inviting artists, intellectuals, men of letters and philosophers. The other great ''salon'' of the time was that of [[Claudine Guérin de Tencin]]. In the 1720s, Voltaire exiled himself in England, where he absorbed Locke's ideas.

The philosophers were, in general, less hostile to monarchical rule than they were to that of the clergy and the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=Jacques|last1=De Cock|authorlink=|title=Politique des Lumières|publisher=Fantasques|page=116|isbn=9782913846166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keTyGJQPpO4C&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his defence of [[Jean Calas]], Voltaire defended Royal justice against the excesses of fantastical provincial courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gérard|last=Lahouati|chapter=Voltaire, la Henriade et l’histoire|language=fr|title=Voltaire|volume=2|place=Université de Pau et des Pays de lAdour|publisher=Presses Paris Sorbonne|year=2002|isbn=9782840502555|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many European monarchs – [[Charles III of Spain]], [[Maria Theresa]] of the House of Habsburg, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Catherine II of Russia]], [[Gustave III of Sweden]] – met with philosophers such as Voltaire, who was presented to the Court of [[Frederick the Great]], and Diderot, who was presented to the Court of [[Catherine the Great]]. Philosophers such as d'Holbach were advocates of &quot;[[enlightened absolutism]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=D'Holbach, qui a étudié à Leyde, est beaucoup plus au courant que Voltaire du développement des sciences … tout en prônant lui aussi le despotisme éclairé|first=Jacques J.|last=Natanson|title=La Mort de Dieu : essai sur l’athéisme moderne|language=fr|trans-title=The Death of God: On Modern Atheism|place=Paris|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|date=1975|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that their ideas would spread more quickly if they had the approval of the Head of State.

=== Dissemination ===
The spread of literacy and reading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Roche|title=Le Peuple de Paris : essai sur la culture populaire au XVIIIeme siecle|language=fr|trans-title=The people of Paris: On 18th-century popular culture|place=Paris|publisher=Librairie Arthème Fayard|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean|last=de Viguerie|title=Une Forme nouvelle de vie consacrée : enseignantes et hospitalières en France aux XVIIeme-XVIIIeme siecles|chapter=Femmes et pouvoirs sous l’ancien régime|language=fr|editor1-first=Danielle Haase|editor1-last=Dubosc|editor2-first=Éliane|editor2-last=Viennot|place=Paris|publisher=Rivages|year=1991|pages=175&amp;ndash;95}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed the development of what may be called an {{lang|fr|''espace public''}}, &quot;public space&quot;; intellectual and political debate was no longer confined to the inner circle of the administrative class and the élite, encompassing larger parts of society. This process of dissemination of new ideas was increased by new methods of communication. Parts of the ''Encyclopédie'', were read by the nobility and the upper class in [[literary salon]]s, with those present giving their opinions on the writings of philosophers. Newspapers and the postal service allowed a more rapid exchange of ideas throughout Europe, resulting in a new form of cultural unity.

==== Encylopédistes ====
[[File:Jean d'Alembert.jpeg|thumb|150px|Jean le Rond d’Alembert (1753) by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]]]]
A second important change by the Lumières movement, looking back to the previous century, had its origin in France with the ''[[Encyclopédistes]]''. This intellectual movement supported the idea that there was a structural model of both scientific and moral knowledge, that this model was innate and that its expression was a form of human liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacques|last=Domenech|title=L'éthique des Lumières|publisher=Vrin|year=1989|isbn=9782711609987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting 1751, [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] published the ''{{lang|fr|[[Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]}}'' (&quot;Systematic Encyclopaedia or Dictionary of Science, Arts and Crafts&quot;). This raised questions on who should have the [[liberty]] to get hold of such information; the Press played an important role in the dissemination of ideas during the [[French Revolution]].

==== Salons and cafés ====
{{main article|Salon (gathering)|Literary café}}
[[File:Salon de Madame Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Une soirée chez Madame Geoffrin'' (1812) by [[Anicet Charles Gabriel Lemonnier]]]]
At first, literary cafés such as the [[Café Procope]] in Paris, were the favoured night-time haunt of young poets and critics, who could read and debate, and bragg about their latest success in the theatre or bookshops. But these were eclipsed by {{lang|fr|''salons littéraires''}} ([[Literary café]]s), open to all who had some talent, at least for public speaking. Their defining characteristic was their intellectual mix; men would gather to express their views and satisfy their thirst for knowledge and to establish their world-view. But it was necessary to be &quot;introduced&quot; into these salons: {{lang|fr|''grandes dames''}} received artists, thinkers and philosophers. Each hostess had her day, her speciality and her special guests. The model example is the hotel of [[Madame de Lambert]] (Anne-Thérèse de Marguenat de Courcelles) at the turn of the century.

Talented men regularly decamped there to expound their ideas and test their latest work on a privileged public. Worldly and cultured, the ''grandes dames'' who set up these salons enlivened the ''soirées'', encouraging the timid and cutting short arguments. Having strong, relatively liberated personalities, they were often writers and diarists themselves.

This social mixing was particularly prominent in 18th-century France, in the &quot;{{lang|fr|''États Généraux de l’esprit humain''}}&quot; (&quot;General States of Human Spirit&quot;) where the Lumières philosophy flourished. Some cultured women were treated as equal to the men on questions of religion, politics and science, and could bring a certain stylishness to debate, for example the contributions of [[Anne Dacier]] to the [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]], and the works of [[Émilie du Châtelet]].

==== Academies, libraries and clubs ====
{{main article|Academy|Masonic lodge}}
[[Image:Image-Jean-Honoré Fragonard 018.jpg|thumb|150px|''La Lecture'' ([[Circa|c.]] 1770) by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]]]
The {{lang|fr|''Académies''}} were [[learned society|learned societies]] which were formed to collate and disseminate works of literature and science. In France, several Royal institutions were set up in the 17th century (the [[Académie française]] in 1634; the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]] in 1663; the [[Académie des sciences (France)|Académie royale des sciences]] in 1666; the [[Académie royale d'architecture]] in 1671),; other societies were set up in Paris, such as the [[Académie nationale de médecine]] in 1731 and the [[Académie nationale de médecine]] in 1776. Clergy and, to a lesser extent, nobility formed the majority of the membership.

Provincial societies acted to bond together the intellectual élite of French towns. Their social composition shows that privileged men were less prominent than in Paris: 37% from the nobility, 20% from the Church. Commoners represented the other 43%. Merchants and manufacturers were a small minority (4%).

Neighbouring academies, public libraries and lecture halls flourished, often involving the same enthusiastic men of learning. They were often supported by individual rich men, or funded by public subscription. They collected scientific works, the great dictionaries, had a lecture hall and, nearby, a discussion room.

All learned societies functioned as open ''salons'' and formed provincial, national and Europe-wide networks, exchanging books and letters, welcoming visiting members, and launching research and teaching programmes in subjects such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mineralogy]], [[agronomy]], and [[demography]].

In the British [[Thirteen Colonies]] of North America, [[James Bowdoin]] (1726&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1790), [[John Adams]] (1735&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1826) and [[John Hancock]] (1737&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1793) founded the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] at [[Boston]] during the [[American War of Independence]]. In 1743, [[Benjamin Franklin]] founded the [[American Philosophical Society]]. At the start of the 19th century, Thomas Jefferson had one of the largest private libraries in the country.

Of all the learned societies, the most advanced was that of the [[Freemasons]], although restricted to the upper classes. Having its origin in [[Great Britain]], [[freemasonry]] embraced all the characteristics of the Lumières: God-fearing, tolerant, liberal, humanist, aesthetic. It took Europe by storm, where it had thousands of lodged by 1789. In civil, military and even religious walks of life, it did particularly well in becoming part of the State apparatus. Neither anticlerical (which they became in the 19th century) nor revolutionary, [[masonic lodge]]s helped to expand on philosophical ideas and the spirit of reform in their political strategies. Intellectual discussion took on an esoteric, or sectarian, nature. Masonic lodges, even more than the Academies, emphasised the importance of equality according to ability rather than privilege by birth.

==== Hawkers and printers ====
The spread of ideas of the Lumières relied just as heavily on the actions of travelling traders. As they moved from town to town, they took their ideas and news with them, and could spread it by word of mouth to the [[illiterate]].

The Press had helped to spread philosophical tracts (notably Diderot and d'Álembert's ''Encyclopédie''), and encouraged the habit of reflective thought in the populace. In the end, the Press helped form public opinion, in spite of the ever-present censorship. Periodicals included the ''[[Journal des savants]]'', also known as the ''Journal des Sçavans'', the ''[[Mercure de France]]'', and economic periodicals such as the  ''[[Éphémérides du citoyen]]'' under [[Nicolas Baudeau]] of the ''[[Économistes]]'' party and [[François Quesnay]] of the ''[[Physiocrates]]''. By cataloguing books and with subscriptions to learned societies, a public far from the centre of political activity could keep up with new ideas, discoveries and debates every month, if not every day.

=== Political influence ===
By the end of the 17th century, John Locke had defined the [[separation of powers]] of government as between the [[executive branch]] and [[legislative branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|langue=|first1=Adhémar|last1=Esmein|author1link=|title=Éléments de droit constitutionnel français et comparé|chapter=|publisher=Sirey|place=Paris|day=|month=|year=1921|volume=|page=458|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QABAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA458#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748) [[Montesquieu]] resurrected the idea of the separation of powers and extended it to include a third power, the [[judicial branch]].

In the 1750s attempts were made in England, Austria,  Prussia and France to &quot;rationalise&quot; their monarchs and their laws.

The &quot;enlightened&quot;' ({{lang-fr|lumineuse}}) idea of a &quot;rational&quot; (or &quot;systematic&quot;; {{lang-fr|rationnel}}) government was cast into the [[American Declaration of Independence]] and, to a lesser extent, in the manifesto of [[Jacobinism]] during the French Revolution. It propagated to the [[United States Constitution]] of 1787.

==== American Revolution ====
[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|200px|''Thomas Jefferson'' (1791) by [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]
[[Thomas Jefferson]], a cultured and learned man and one of the original planters of the [[State of Virginia]], was well known to the English philosopher John Locke, and the Genevan Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He presided over the drafting of the [[Constitution of Virginia]] in 1776, from which he took certain parts when drafting the [[American Declaration of Independence]], proclaimed on 4 July 1776 at the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In the summer of 1784, he travelled to Europe to take over the duties of [[Benjamin Franklin]] as Ambassador of the United States to France, and during this time he met many of the Lumières, becoming a frequent visitor to literary salons and bookshops in Paris.

The influence of the Lumières'philosophy is apparent in the Declaration of Independence, with the proclamations that all men are created equal and its opposition to [[tyranny]]. The 1787 [[United States Constitution]] restates Montesquieu's principle of the [[separation of powers]]  into [[legislative branch|legislative]], [[executive branch|executive]] and [[judicial branch|judicial]] branches, which together form the foundations of modern democracy.

==== French Revolution ====
As the philosophy took hold in the salons, the cafés and the clubs,  the [[absolute rule]] of the monarch disintegrated, in part because of opposition by the [[French nobility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Mornet|language=fr|title=Les Origines intellectuelles de la Révolution française (1715-1787)|place=Paris|publisher=Armand Colin|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; who saw no future for themselves in reform.

During the [[French Revolution]], philosophical ideas informed political debate. The majority of deputies to the National Assembly were from the cultured [[bourgeois]] class, who aspired to ideas of liberty and equality. For example, [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] was an enthusiastic follower of Rousseau. But most of the French philosophers died before seeing their seedlings planted during the Revolution bear fruit, with the exception of [[Nicolas de Condorcet]], [[Louis Sébastien Mercier]] and [[Abbé Raynal]]. The first two of these three [[Girondist]]s fell out of favour; only the third came out with honour, even, after his death in 1796, having a bust made in honour of his essays on the abolition of black [[slavery]], on 4 February 1794 (in the Gregorian calendar; 16 pluviôse of year II in the [[French Republican Calendar]]). He was also the uncle of a {{lang|fr|''conventionnel régicide''}}, [[Simon Camboulas]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}}

The French Revolution in particular represents a violent application of the Lumières' philosophy, especially during the [[Reign of Terror]], the [[interregnum]] of the [[Jacobin]]s. Descartes characterised the desire for a &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot; revolution as one that aimed to eradicate the Church, and Christianity, entirely.

The [[National Convention (France)|National Convention]] revoked the [[French Republican Calendar]], the system of measurement of time, and the system of [[currency]], while making the goal of equality, both social and economic, the highest priority of the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=Prosper|last1=Poullet|author1link=Prosper Poullet|title=Les institutions françaises de 1795 à 1814|chapter=|publisher=Plon-Nourrit|place=Paris|day=|month=|year=1907|volume=|page=223|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgrAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French emigration''' from the years 1789 to 1815 refers to the mass movement of citizens from France to neighboring countries in reaction to the bloodshed and upheaval caused by the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic]] rule.  Although the Revolution began in 1789 as a peaceful, [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]-led effort for increased political equality for the Third Estate (the non-elite, unprivileged masses of France), it soon turned into a violent, popular rebellion.  To escape political tensions and save their lives, a number of individuals emigrated from France and settled in the neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), however quite a few also went to the United States.

== Revolution begins ==
When the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]] convened in 1789 and aired out their political grievances, many members of each estate found themselves in agreement with the idea that the bulk of France, the Third Estate, was carrying the tax burden without equitable political representation. They even took an oath, the [[Tennis Court Oath]], swearing to pursue their political goals and committing to drafting a constitution which codified equality.  Soon, the ideologies of fair and equal treatment by the government and liberation from the old regime diffused throughout France.

=== The first émigrés ===
While the &quot;Father of the Revolution&quot;, [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sièyes]], and several other men of the first and second estates supported the Third Estate's desire for equality, several members of the clergy and nobility were averse to it.  Under the old regime, they were accustomed with a certain quality of living and with the right to pass this life to their children. The Revolution was looking to remove all privilege in an effort to make everyone politically equal, so the first [[émigré]]s, or emigrants, were proponents of the old order and chose to leave France although emigration abroad was not prohibited.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jewish Emigrés during the French Revolution|jstor = 4465274|journal = Jewish Social Studies|date = 1954-10-01|pages = 319–334|volume = 16|issue = 4|first = Zosa|last = Szajkowski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable émigrés include Madames [[Princess Marie Adélaïde of France|Adélaïde]] and [[Princess Victoire of France|Victoire]], aunts of King Louis XVI, who on 19 February 1791 started their journey to Rome to live nearer to the Pope. However, their journey was stopped by and largely debated by the National Assembly who feared that their emigration implied that King Louis and his family would soon follow suit. While this fear eventually resulted in the [[Day of Daggers]] and later the King's [[Flight to Varennes|attempt to escape Paris]], the Madames were permitted to continue their journey after statesman [[Jacques-François Menou|Jacques-François de Menou]] joking about the Assembly's preoccupation with the actions of &quot;two old women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The history of the French revolution|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yDIEAAAAQAAJ|date = 1845|first = Marie Joseph L. Adolphe|last = Thiers|page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon settling in neighboring countries such as Great Britain, they were able to assimilate well and maintained a certain level of comfort in their new lifestyles.  This was a significant emigration; it marked the presence of many royalists outside France where they could be safe, alive, and await their opportunity to reenter the French political climate.  However, the majority of the émigrés left France not in 1789 at the crux of the revolution, but in 1792 after the warfare had broken out.  Unlike the privileged classes who had voluntarily fled earlier, those displaced by war were driven out by fear for their lives and were of lower status and lesser or no means.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The French Emigres in Europe and the Struggle against Revolution, 1789-1814 (review)|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/french_forum/v026/26.2pacini.html|journal = French Forum|date = 2001-01-01|issn = 1534-1836|pages = 113–115|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1353/frf.2001.0020|first = Giulia|last = Pacini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation to leave ==
As the notions of political freedom and equality spread, people began developing different opinions on who should reap the benefits of active citizenship.  The political unity that the revolutionaries once had begun to fizzle out by 1791, although they had succeeded in establishing a [[Constitutional monarchy|Constitutional Monarchy]].

Simultaneously, the Revolution was plagued with many problems.  In addition to political divisions, they were dealing with the hyperinflation of the [[National Convention]]'s fiat paper currency, the ''[[assignat]]s,'' revolts against authority in the countryside, slave uprisings in colonial territories such as the [[Haitian Revolution]], and no peaceful end in sight.  Someone had to be blamed for the failures of the revolution, and it certainly could not be the fault of the revolutionaries for they were on the side of liberty and justice.  As Thomas E. Kaiser argues in his article &quot;From the Austrian Committee to the Foreign Plot: Marie-Antoinette, Austrophobia, and the Terror&quot;, centuries of [[Austrophobia]] was reincarnated into a firm belief in an Austrian led conspiracy aiming to thwart the revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From the Austrian Committee to the Foreign Plot: Marie-Antoinette, Austrophobia, and the Terror|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/french_historical_studies/v026/26.4kaiser.html|journal = French Historical Studies|date = 2003-01-01|issn = 1527-5493|pages = 579–617|volume = 26|issue = 4|first = Thomas|last = Kaiser}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaiser states that the Foreign Plot:  &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;consisted of a massive, multilayered conspiracy by counterrevolutionary agents abetted by the allies, who allegedly—and quite possibly in reality—sought to undermine the Republic through a coordinated effort to corrupt government officials associated with the more moderate wing of the Jacobin establishment and to defame the government by mobilizing elements on the extreme left.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A political faction known as the [[Jacobin]]s, who had a very active radical faction, the [[Girondists]], genuinely feared this conspiratorial plot.  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], a [[philosophe]] influential in the Enlightenment and fellow Jacobin, spread the idea of a &quot;collective will&quot;, a singular purpose which the people of a nation must all unequivocally support.  If anyone was against the collective will, they were a part of this counterrevolutionary conspiracy, and since the momentum of the Revolution had to be protected at all costs, any and all threats had to be eliminated.  This attitude toward dissension only grew more violent and bloodthirsty throughout 1793-1794 when [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] enacted the  [[Reign of Terror]].  In order to preserve the &quot;republic of virtue&quot;, Robespierre had to ''&quot;''cleanse&quot; the country of anyone who spoke out or acted against the virtues of the revolution by way of the [[guillotine]].  In this tumultuous time, several were justified in fearing for their lives.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Mass exodus ==
No one was really safe from scrutiny or the chopping block, ultimately not even Robespierre himself. This omnipresent sense of fear inspired many of lesser means to flee France, often without much preparation and therefore no money or helpful belongings. Those who left France were a heterogeneous bunch socioeconomically and professionally, although the vast majority of migrants were men. While these people came from diverse financial backgrounds, they all more or less suffered the same poverty while traveling. In his thesis &quot;'La Généreuse Nation!' Britain and the French Emigration 1792-1802&quot;, Callum Whittaker recounts that while leaving France one aristocrat &quot;disguised herself as a sailor, and hid for a day in the hold of a ship underneath a pile of ropes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;  Also, captains and sailors saw this as an opportunity to earn a little on the side, and so they levied taxes on the emigrants, leaving them on the shores of another nation with nothing. Yet still, thousands chose this path of discomfort and destitution because it at least provided the promise of peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

=== Jewish migration  ===
The Jewish people had historically been made a scapegoat for sociopolitical problems, and once again they were viewed with suspicion during this time.  While a percentage of the Jewish people was politically aligned with the [[Royalists]], the distrust was unwarranted.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  A majority of Jews were not counterrevolutionaries and did not partake in crimes against the republic such as money crimes with the ''[[assignats]]'', although this was highly speculated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;  In [[Alsace]], minorities such as the Jews and Protestants were pro-revolution, while the Catholic majority was not.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Despite these facts, as Zosa Szajkowski states in the text ''Jews and the French Revolutions of 1789, 1830, and 1848'' it was still a widely held belief that &quot;the Jews wanted to bring about a counter-revolution with all its destruction and death&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Thus, the Jews were continuously unfairly suspected of fraud, although rarely ever convicted for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;   Also, their correspondence in Hebrew with those living outside France was restricted.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;   August Mauger, the leader of the terror in Nancy, refused to give Jews passports.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  Those emigrating had to do so illegally, without proper documentation and thus without guarantee of success.  Threat of execution was very real for many more people than simply the Jewish population of France.  Lacoste, the safety commissioner of Alsace, believed that one-fourth of the Parisian population should be guillotined.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  Jewish and non-Jewish alike emigrated to the Upper Rhine; despite periodic [[pogrom]]s in the area, it was still better than the Lower Rhine where the Terror was rampant; very few Jewish Frenchmen remained in Alsace.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The Jewish émigrés had to face the challenges of  assimilating to a ''new'' culture which harbored a strong anti-Jewish ''and'' anti-French sentiment. Furthermore, the annual summertime invasions of the French army from 1793&amp;ndash;1799 meant the immediate evacuation of any immigrant population. Consequently, the exact number of French in any specific area varied at any given time, but historical estimates place the number in the several thousands.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

== Life after emigration ==
For most émigrés, returning to France was out of the question.  While they did manage to escape the guillotine, they would face the death penalty if they were to return.  Furthermore, their property and possessions were confiscated by the state, so there would be nowhere and nothing to return to.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Wherever the migrants ended up, it was imperative that they were able to assimilate to the local culture.

Upon arrival in their host nations, the émigrés were watched with a cautious eye.  Many locals were naturally weary of these foreigners who did not share their customs and who had been exposed to radical, violent, revolutionary principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;  Although there was initial hesitation, citizens quickly learned that these migrants were refugees, searching for tranquility and focusing on how to feed themselves and their family members, not agents sent by France to disrupt the political order.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;   While this generation of individuals did not have the luxury of being very politically active, their presence in neighboring European countries and the United States caused a wrinkle in the fabric of society.  These thousands of men, women, and children had survived a popular uprising and would never be able to forget their experiences in revolutionary France, the uncertainty, turmoil, and promise of liberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== America ===
Tens of thousands of émigrés saw America as a compelling destination for multiple reasons.  Those who craved peace and stability were drawn to the neutral stance America had taken on the many wars France was engaged in with her neighbors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The &quot;Non-Aligned Status&quot; of French Emigrés and Refugees in Philadelphia, 1793-1798|url = https://transatlantica.revues.org/1147|journal = Transatlantica.

Although they appreciated being away from the Terror, the French felt distant from their American denizens and imposed a self-isolation from their community.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The &quot;Non-Aligned Status&quot; of French Emigrés and Refugees in Philadelphia, 1793-1798|url = https://transatlantica.revues.org/1147|journal = Transatlantica.

Many more stayed on the European continent, in Great Britain, France's neighbor to the north.  The country appealed to people because it had a channel separating them from the revolutionaries and because it was known for being tolerant.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Emigrants primarily settled in London and Soho, the latter had grown into a thriving French cultural district, complete with French hotels and cuisine, although it had long been a haven for French exiles, housing many thousands of Frenchmen from the last mass migration which occurred in reaction to the [[Edict of Nantes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Here the French had a somewhat easier transition into English society, but to say emigrating to this district was easy is to dismiss how truly austere their circumstance; &quot;money remained a chronic concern and hunger a constant companion&quot; (Whittaker).&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;  Most people just picked back up the trades they had in France, and aristocrats found themselves having to seek employment for the first time in years.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;   Those who had no knowledge of skills that would benefit them as laborers turned to crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;  Malnutrition and poor living conditions led to an onslaught of maladies, and death did not quit put an end to their suffering for even posthumously their families were beset with the financial burden of administering their funeral rites.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

The number of refugees fleeing into Britain reached its climax in autumn of 1792. In September alone, a total of nearly 4000 refugees landed in Britain. The number of displaced persons who found themselves in Great Britain was high, although the exact number is debated, it is believed to be in the thousands.  The uncontrolled influx of foreigners created significant anxiety in government circles and the wider community.  After much debate, the Parliament of Great Britain passed the [[Aliens Act 1793|Aliens Act of 1793]] which served to regulate and reduce immigration. Those entering the country were required to give their names, ranks, occupations, and addresses to the local Justice of Peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 1905 Aliens Act {{!}} History Today|url = http://www.historytoday.com/anne-kershen/1905-aliens-act|website = www.historytoday.com|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who did not comply, were deported or imprisoned. Community concern at the influx of French refugees slowly abated as time passed and the circumstances of the French Revolution became better known, and there is considerable evidence of charitable and hospitable acts toward the émigrés.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = &quot;La Généreuse Nation!&quot; Britain and the French Emigration 1792 – 1802|url = http://www.academia.edu/2909048/_La_G%25C3%25A9n%25C3%25A9reuse_Nation_Britain_and_the_French_Emigration_1792_1802|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wilmot Committee, a private network of social elite, provided fiscal support to the refugees, and later the government adopted a national relief campaign which gained support both from those with political clout as well as the masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = &quot;La Généreuse Nation!&quot; Britain and the French Emigration 1792 – 1802|url = http://www.academia.edu/2909048/_La_G%25C3%25A9n%25C3%25A9reuse_Nation_Britain_and_the_French_Emigration_1792_1802|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Haiti}}

The '''Haitian Revolution''' ({{lang-fr|Révolution haïtienne}} {{IPA-fr|ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ ajisjɛ̃n|}}), was a successful [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] and anti-[[Colonialism#Colonialism and the history of thought|colonial]] insurrection that took place in the former [[First French Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|colony]] of [[Saint-Domingue]] that lasted from 1791 until 1804. It affected the institution of [[slavery]] throughout the Americas. [[slave revolt|Self-liberated slaves]] destroyed slavery at home, fought to preserve their freedom, and with the collaboration of [[Mulattoes in Haiti|mulattoes]], founded the sovereign state of [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12233/abstract | title=Navigating Haiti’s History: Saint-Domingue and the Haitian Revolution | author=Taber, Robert D. “.” 13, no. 5 (2015): 235–50. doi:10.1111/hic3.12233. | journal=History Compass | year=2015 | volume=13 | issue=5 | pages=235–50 | doi=10.1111/hic3.12233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friends and Enemies&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaTGbfYDB7gC&amp;dq=Haitian+%22a+world+historical+process%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Friends and Enemies: The Scribal Politics of Post/colonial Literature | publisher=Liverpool University Press | author=Bongie, Chris | year=2008 | location=Liverpool, UK | pages=45 | isbn=184631142X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cross-border studies&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Incorporating Comparisons in the Rift: Making Use of Cross-Place Events and Histories in Moments of World Historical Change, a chapter in Anna Amelina, Beyond methodological nationalism: research methodologies for cross-border studies | publisher=Taylor and Francis, | author=Curtis Comstock, Sandra | year=2012 | pages=183–185 | isbn=0-415-89962-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It led to the greatest slave uprising since [[Spartacus]]'s [[Third Servile War|unsuccessful revolt]] against the [[Roman Republic]] nearly 1,900 years prior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vulliamy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/28/10-best-revolutionaries-che-guevara-mahatma-gandhi-leon-trotsky |title=The 10 best revolutionaries |editor=Vulliamy, Ed |date=28 August 2010 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical debates==

While acknowledging the cross-influences, most contemporary historians distinguish the Haitian Revolution from the [[French Revolution]]. Some even separate it from the mulattoes' earlier armed conflicts, which at first sought political rights for themselves, but not the [[abolition of slavery]]. These scholars show that if the [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] of the enslaved blacks becomes the focus of studies, the Revolution's opening and closing dates are certain. From this premise, the narrative began with the enslaved blacks' bid for freedom through armed struggle and concluded with their victory over [[Plantocracy|slaving powers]] and the creation of an independent state. In April 1791, a massive black insurgency turned violently against the [[plantation system]], setting a precedent of resistance to racial slavery. In cooperation with their former mulatto rivals, blacks ended the Revolution in November 1803 when they decidedly defeated the [[French army]] at the [[Battle of Vertières]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Philippe R. Girard (2011). The Slaves Who Defeated Napoleon: Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian War of Independence 1801–1804. Tuscaloosa Alabama: The University of Alabama Press. ISBN 978-0-8173-1732-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is known as a single event under the name of &quot;Haitian Revolution,&quot; alternative views suggest that the entire affair was an assorted number of coincidental conflicts that ended with a fragile truce between mulattoes and blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) {{!}} The black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|url = http://www.blackpast.org/gah/haitian-revolution-1791-1804|website = www.blackpast.org|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief concern flutters around the question if the victorious Haitians were &quot;intrinsically [a] [[revolution]]ary force,&quot; or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Haitian Revolution: A Documentary History | publisher=Hackett Publishing Company | author=Geggus, David | year=2014 | pages=16 | isbn=9781624661792}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thing is sure: [[Haiti]] became an independent [[nation-state|country]] on January 1, 1804, when the council of generals chose [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] to assume the office of governor-general. One of the state's first significant documents was Dessaliness' &quot;Liberty or Death&quot; speech, which circulated broadly in the foreign press. In it, the new head of state made the case for the new nation's coherent objective: the permanent abolition of slavery in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_q6VhhkczIYMm1fQk9ab0JHcjA | title=Dessaliness Proclamation: Liberty or Death | work=News Article | date=March 24, 1804 | agency=New York Commercial Advertiser | accessdate=December 10, 2015 | location=NY | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
An independent government was created in Haiti, but the country's society remained deeply affected by patterns established under French colonial rule. Since many planters had provided for the mixed-race children they had by African women, by giving them education and (for males) training and ''entrée'' into the French military, the mulatto descendants who along with the wealthy [[freedmen]] had been orchestrators of the revolution became the elite of Haitian society after the war's end. Many of them had used their [[social capital]] to acquire wealth, and some already owned land. Some had identified more with the French colonists than the slaves.

Mulatto domination of politics and economics after the revolution created another two-caste society, as most Haitians were rural subsistence farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ch6&quot;/&gt; In addition, the nascent state's future was compromised in 1825 when France forced it to pay 150 million gold francs in reparations to French ex-slaveholders—as a condition of French recognition and to end the nation's political and economic isolation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2000|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/httoc.html#ht0021|title=A Country Study: Haiti – Boyer: Expansion and Decline|publisher=&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt; Library of Congress|accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the amount of the reparations was reduced in 1838, Haiti was unable to finish paying off its debt until 1947, and the payments left the country's government deeply impoverished, causing instability.

==Background==
Much of the [[Caribbean]] economic development was contingent to Europeans' [[History of sugar|demand for sugar]], which [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] owners traded for European and North American manufactured goods. Saint Domingue also had extensive coffee, cocoa, and indigo plantations, but these were smaller and less profitable than the wealthy sugar plantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas E. Weil 1985&quot;&gt;Thomas E. Weil, Jan Knippers Black, Howard I. Blustein, Kathryn T. Johnston, David S. McMorris, Frederick P. Munson, ''Haiti: A Country Study''. (Washington, D.C.: The American University Foreign Area Handbook Series 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1730s, French engineers constructed complex [[irrigation system]]s to increase [[sugarcane]] production. By the 1740s Saint-Domingue, together with [[Jamaica]], had become the main supplier of the world's sugar. Sugar production depended on extensive manual labor provided by enslaved Africans in the harsh Saint-Domingue colonial plantation economy. The white planters who derived their wealth from the sale of slave-produced sugar knew they were outnumbered by slaves by a factor of more than ten; they lived in fear of slave rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief&quot;/&gt; White masters extensively used the threat of physical violence to maintain control and limit this possibility for slave rebellion. When slaves left the plantations or disobeyed their masters, they were subject to whipping, or to more extreme torture such as castration or burning, the punishment being both a personal lesson and a warning for other slaves. [[Louis XIV]], the French King, passed the [[Code Noir]] in 1685 in an attempt to regulate such violence and the treatment of the enslaved person in general in the colony, but masters openly and consistently broke the code, and local legislation reversed parts of it throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurent Dubois 2OO4&quot;&gt;Laurent Dubois, ''Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution''. (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2OO4).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1758, the white landowners began passing legislation restricting the rights of other groups of people until a rigid caste system was defined. Most historians have classified the people of the era into three groups. One was the white colonists, or ''blancs''. This group is generally subdivided into the plantation owners and a lower class of whites who often served as overseers or day laborers.

A second was the free blacks (usually mixed-race, known as mulattoes or ''[[gens de couleur]] libres'', [[free people of color]]). These ''gens de couleur'' tended to be educated and literate and they often served in the army or as administrators on plantations. Many were children of white planters and enslaved mothers while others had purchased their freedom from their owners through the sale of their own produce or artistic works. They often received education or artisan training, and sometimes inherited freedom or property from their fathers. Some gens de couleur even operated their own plantations and were slave owners.

The third group, outnumbering the others by a ratio of ten to one, was made up of mostly African-born [[slave]]s. A high rate of mortality among them meant that planters continually had to import new slaves. This kept their culture more African and separate from other people on the island. Many plantations had large concentrations of slaves from a particular region of Africa, and it was therefore somewhat easier for these groups to maintain elements of their culture, religion, and language. This also separated new slaves from Africa from creoles (slaves born in the colony), who already had kin networks and often had more prestigious roles on plantations and more opportunities for emancipation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurent Dubois 2004&quot;&gt;Laurent Dubois, ''Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution''. (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Most slaves spoke a ''[[patois]]'' of the French language known as [[Haitian Creole|Creole]], which was also used by native mulattoes and whites for communication with the workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;kreyol-003&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kreyol.com/history003.html|title= Haiti – French Colonialism|accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White colonists and black slaves frequently came into violent conflict. Many of these involved slaves who had escaped the plantations. Many runaway slaves—called [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]]—hid on the margins of large plantations, living off the land and what they could steal from their former masters. Others fled to towns, to blend in with urban slaves and freed slaves who often concentrated in those areas. If caught, these runaway slaves would be severely and violently punished. However, some masters tolerated ''petit marronages'', or short-term absences from plantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurent Dubois 2004&quot;/&gt;

Often, however, larger groups of runaway slaves lived in the woods away from control. They often conducted violent raids on the island's sugar and coffee plantations. Although the numbers in these bands grew large (sometimes into the thousands), they generally lacked the leadership and strategy to accomplish large-scale objectives. The first effective maroon leader to emerge was the charismatic [[François Mackandal]], who succeeded in unifying the black resistance. A [[Haitian Vodou]] priest, Mackandal inspired his people by drawing on African traditions and [[Religion in Africa|religions]]. He united the maroon bands and also established a network of secret organizations among plantation slaves, leading a rebellion from 1751 through 1757. Although Mackandal was captured by the French and burned at the stake in 1758, large armed maroon bands persisted in raids and harassment after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Rogozinski| first = Jan| title = A Brief History of the Caribbean| edition = Revised| year = 1999| publisher = Facts on File| location = New York| isbn = 0-8160-3811-2| pages = 85, 116–117, 164–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kreyol-004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kreyol.com/history004.html|title=The Slave Rebellion of 1791|accessdate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation in 1789==

===Social stratification===
In 1789 [[Saint-Domingue]] produced 60% of the world's coffee and 40% of the world's sugar imported by France and Britain. The colony was the most profitable possession of the French Empire. Saint-Domingue was also the wealthiest and most prosperous colony, for the plantation owners at least, of all the colonies in the Caribbean.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 1789, whites numbered 40,000; mulattoes and free blacks, 28,000; and black slaves, an estimated 452,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bonham C. Richardson| title = The Caribbean in the Wider World, 1492–1992 A Regional Geography| url = https://books.google.com/?id=kesL--n3YN4C&amp;pg=PA166| year = 1992| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-35977-1| page = 166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest class of society was enslaved blacks, who outnumbered whites and free people of color by a margin of ten to one.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief2&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Rogozinski| first = Jan| title = A Brief History of the Caribbean| edition = Revised| year = 1999| publisher = Facts on File, Inc.| location = New York| isbn = 0-8160-3811-2| pages = 164–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slave population on the island totaled almost half of the one million slaves in the Caribbean by 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Klein, ''Transatlantic Slave Trade'', Pg. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Two thirds were African-born, and they tended to be less submissive than those born in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;CLR James, The Black Jacobins, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The death rate in the Caribbean exceeded the birth rate, so imports of enslaved Africans were necessary to maintain the numbers required to work the plantations. The slave population declined at an annual rate of two to five percent, due to overwork, inadequate food and shelter, insufficient clothing and medical care, and an imbalance between the sexes, with more men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Matthewson, ''A Pro-Slavery Foreign Policy: Haitian-American Relations During the Early Republic'', (Praeger: Westport, Connecticut. and London: 2003) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Some slaves were of a creole elite class of urban slaves and domestics, who worked as cooks, personal servants and artisans around the plantation house. This relatively privileged class was chiefly born in the Americas, while the under-class born in Africa labored hard, and more often than not, under abusive and brutal conditions.

Among Saint-Domingue's 40,000 white [[Colonisation|colonials]] in 1789, European-born Frenchmen monopolized administrative posts. The sugar planters, the ''grands blancs'', were chiefly minor aristocrats. Most returned to France as soon as possible, hoping to avoid the dreaded [[yellow fever]], which regularly swept the colony.&lt;ref&gt;C.L.R. James, ''Black Jacobins'' (Vintage, 1989) 2d ed. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The lower-class whites, ''petits blancs'', included artisans, shopkeepers, slave dealers, overseers, and day laborers.

Saint-Domingue's free people of color, the ''[[gens de couleur]]'', numbered more than 28,000 by 1789. Around that time, colonial legislations, concerned with this growing and strengthening population, passed discriminatory laws that visibly differentiated these freedmen by dictating their clothing and where they could live. These laws also barred them from occupying many public offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas E. Weil 1985&quot;/&gt; Many of these freedmen were also artisans and overseers, or domestic servants in the plantation houses.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Heinl, ''Written in Blood: The History of the Haitian People'', New York: Lanham, 1996, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Le Cap Français, a northern port, had a large population of freed slaves, and these men would later become important leaders in the 1791 slave rebellion and later revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurent Dubois 2004&quot;/&gt;

===Regional conflicts===
In addition to class and racial tension between whites, free people of color, and enslaved blacks, the country was polarized by regional rivalries between the [[Nord Department (Haiti)|North]], [[Sud Department|South]], and [[Ouest (department)|West]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The North was the center of shipping and trading, and therefore had the largest French elite population. The [[Nord Department (Haiti)|Plaine du Nord]] on the northern shore of Saint-Domingue was the most fertile area with the largest sugar plantations. It was the area of most economic importance, especially as most of the colony's trade went through these ports. The largest and busiest port was Le Cap Français (present-day Le Cap Haïtien), the capital of French Saint-Domingue until 1751, when Port-au-Prince was made the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurent Dubois 2004&quot; /&gt; In this northern region, enslaved Africans lived in large groups of workers in relative isolation, separated from the rest of the colony by the high mountain range known as the ''Massif du Nord''. These slaves would join with urban slaves from Le Cap to lead the 1791 rebellion, which began in this region. This area was the seat of power of the ''grands blancs'', the rich white colonists who wanted greater autonomy for the colony, especially economically.&lt;ref name=&quot;caribbean&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Knight| first = Franklin W.| title = The Caribbean The Genesis of a Fragmented Nationalism| edition = 3rd| year = 1990| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = New York| isbn = 0-19-505441-5| pages = 204–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Province, however, grew significantly after the capital was relocated to Port-au-Prince in 1751, and the region became increasingly wealthy in the second half of the 18th century when irrigation projects allowed significant sugar plantation growth.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The Southern Province lagged in population and wealth because it was geographically separated from the rest of the colony. However, this isolation allowed freed slaves to find profit in trade with British Jamaica, and they gained power and wealth here.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurent Dubois 2004&quot;/&gt; In addition to these interregional tensions, there were conflicts between proponents of independence, those loyal to France, allies of Spain, and allies of Great Britain – who coveted control of the valuable colony.

==Impact of the French Revolution==
{{Further|French Revolution}}
In France, the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] made radical changes in French laws, and on 26 August 1789, published the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]], declaring all men free and equal. The French Revolution shaped the course of the conflict in Saint-Domingue and was at first widely welcomed in the island. Wealthy whites saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France, which would allow elite plantation-owners to take control of the island and create trade regulations that would further their own wealth and power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas E. Weil 1985&quot;/&gt; There were so many twists and turns in the leadership in France, and there were so many complex events in Saint-Domingue, that various classes and parties changed their alignments many times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} However, the Haitian Revolution quickly became a test of the ideology of the French Revolution, as it radicalized the slavery question and forced French leaders to recognize the full meaning of their revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Robin. &quot;The Force of Example&quot;. ''The Impact of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World''. Ed. David P. Geggus. (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The African population on the island began to hear of the agitation for independence by the rich European planters, the ''grands blancs'', who had resented France's limitations on the island's foreign trade. The Africans mostly allied with the [[House of Bourbon|royalists]] and the British, as they understood that if [[Saint-Domingue]]'s independence were to be led by white slave masters, it would probably mean even harsher treatment and increased injustice for the African population. The plantation owners would be free to operate slavery as they pleased without the existing minimal accountability to their French peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;caribbean&quot;/&gt;

Saint-Domingue's [[free people of color]], most notably [[Julien Raimond]], had been actively appealing to France for full civil equality with whites since the 1780s. Raimond used the French Revolution to make this the major colonial issue before the [[National Assembly of France]]. In October 1790, [[Vincent Ogé]], another wealthy free man of color from the colony, returned home from Paris, where he had been working with Raimond.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Convinced that a law passed by the French [[National Convention|Constituent Assembly]] gave full [[civil rights]] to wealthy men of color, Ogé demanded the [[right to vote]]. When the colonial governor refused, Ogé led a brief [[insurgency]] in the area around [[Cap Français]]. He and an army of around three hundred free blacks fought to end racial discrimination in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langley|first1=Lester|title=The Americas in the Age of Revolution, 1750-1850|date=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured in early 1791, and brutally executed by being &quot;broken on the [[Breaking wheel|wheel]]&quot; before being beheaded.&lt;ref name=&quot;kreyol-004&quot;/&gt; Ogé was not fighting against slavery, but his treatment was cited by later slave rebels as one of the factors in their decision to rise up in August 1791 and resist treaties with the colonists. The conflict up to this point was between factions of whites, and between whites and free blacks. Enslaved blacks watched from the sidelines.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief&quot;/&gt;

Leading 18th-century French writer [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Count Mirabeau]] had once said the Saint-Domingue whites &quot;slept at the foot of [[Vesuvius]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Adam ''Bury the Chains: The British Struggle to Abolish Slavery'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; an indication of the grave threat they faced should the majority of slaves launch a sustained major uprising.

==Relationship between the French Revolution and the Haitian Revolution==

===Reason for revolution===

The Haitian Revolution was a revolution ignited from below, by the underrepresented majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Fick, Carolyn E. &quot;Preface.&quot; In The Making of Haiti: The Saint Domingue Revolution from below. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; A huge majority of the supporters of the Haitian revolution were slaves and freed Africans that were treated unequally by society and the law.&lt;ref&gt;Akamefula, Tiye, Camille Newsom, Burgey Marcos, and Jong Ho. &quot;Causes of the Haitian Revolution.&quot; Haitian Revolution.

===Brutality===

Despite the idealist, rational and utopian thinking surrounding both uprisings, extreme brutality was a fundamental aspect of both uprisings. Besides initial cruelty that created the precarious conditions that bred the revolution, there was violence from both sides throughout the revolution. The period of violence during the French Revolution is known as the Reign of Terror. Those killed via guillotine, “breaking at the wheel”, or some other horrific death machines were perceived as adversaries to the revolution and death toll estimates range from 18,000 to 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Reign of Terror: 1793–1794.&quot; PBS.

===Lasting change===

The Revolution in Haiti did not wait on the Revolution in France. The individuals in Haiti relied on no other resolution but their own. The call for modification of society was influenced by the revolution in France, but once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of the Haitian people, there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;scholar.library.miami.edu&quot;&gt;Rand, David. &quot;The Haitian Revolution.&quot; The Haitian Revolution. Accessed March 25, 2015. http://scholar.library.miami.edu/slaves/san_domingo_revolution/ individual_essay/david.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;scholar.library.miami.edu&quot;/&gt; Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti &lt;ref name=&quot;Ghachem, Malick W 2012&quot;/&gt; and the revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent nation solely of freed peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;haitianrevolutionfblock.weebly.com&quot;&gt;Akamefula, Tiye, Camille Newsom, Burgey Marcos, and Jong Ho. &quot;Causes of the Haitian Revolution.&quot; Haitian Revolution.

France’s transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti’s influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.&lt;ref&gt;Baur, John. &quot;International Repercussions of the Haitian Revolution.&quot; The Americas 26, no. 4 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Enlightenment thought==

French writer [[Guillaume Raynal]] attacked slavery in his history of European colonization. He warns, “the Africans only want a chief, sufficiently courageous, to lead them on to vengeance and slaughter.”&lt;ref&gt;“Antislavery Agitation: Abbe Raynal,” Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the East and West Indies (1770), accessed May 8, 2014, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/278/.&lt;/ref&gt; Raynal’s Enlightenment philosophy went deeper than a prediction and reflected many French Enlightenment philosophies including those of Rousseau and Diderot, even though it was written thirteen years before the “[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].” The declaration, in contrast, highlighted freedom and liberty but still allowed slaves to be characterized as property.

In addition to Raynal’s influence, [[Toussaint Louverture]] was a key Enlightened actor in the Haitian Revolution. Enlightened thought divided the world into &quot;enlightened leaders&quot; and &quot;ignorant masses&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann, Lucien. The philosophy of the Enlightenment: the Christian burgess and the Enlightenment. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Louverture attempted to bridge this divide between the popular masses and the enlightened few.&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Miller, &quot;Enlightened Hesitations: Black Masses and Tragic Heroes in C.L.R. James's The Black Jacobins.&quot; MLN 116: 1069–1090. (accessed May 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Louverture was familiar with Enlightenment ideas within the context of European imperialism. He attempted to strike a balance between Western Enlightened thought as a necessary means of winning liberation, and not propagating the notion that it was morally superior to the experiences and knowledge of people of color on Saint Domingue.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. R. James, The Black Jacobins; Toussaint Louverture and the San Domingo Revolution.. 1st ed. New York: Vintage Books, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; As an extension of himself and his Enlightened education, Louverture wrote a Constitution for a new society in Saint-Domingue that abolished slavery. The existence of slavery in Enlightened society was an incongruity that had been left unaddressed by European scholars. Louverture took on this inconsistency directly in his constitution. In addition, Louverture exhibited a connection to Enlightenment scholars through the style, language and accent of this text.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1069–1090.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Louverture, [[Jean-Baptiste Belley]] was also an active participant in the colony’s insurrection. The portrait of Belley by [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]] depicts a man who encompasses the French view of its colonies. The portrait creates a stark dichotomy between the refinement of French Enlightenment thought and the reality of the situation in Saint Domingue, through the bust of Raynald and the figure of Belley, respectively. While distinguished, the portrait still portrays a man trapped by the confines of race. Girodet’s portrayal of the former National Convention deputy is telling of the French opinion of colonial citizens by emphasizing the subject’s sexuality and including an earring. Both of these racially charged symbols reveal the desire to undermine the colony’s attempts at independent legitimacy, as citizens of the colonies were not able to access the elite class of French Revolutionaries because of their race.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Musto, “Portraiture, Revolutionary Identity and Subjugation”: Anne-Louis Girodet’s Citizen Belley, RACAR: Revue d'Art Canadienne / Canadian Art Review 20 (1993): 60–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1791 slave rebellion==
{{North American Slave Revolts}}
{{Further|Slavery in Haiti}}
[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightened]] writer [[Guillaume Thomas François Raynal|Guillaume Raynal]] attacked slavery in the 1780 edition of his history of European colonization. He also predicted a general slave revolt in the colonies, saying that there were signs of &quot;the impending storm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Center and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality and Fraternity'', 119.&lt;/ref&gt; One such sign was the action of the French revolutionary government to grant citizenship to wealthy free people of color in May 1791. Since white plantation owners refused to comply with this decision, within two months isolated fighting broke out between the former slaves and the whites. This added to the tense climate between slaves and grands blancs.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, &quot;Haiti's Slavery in the Age of the Democratic Revolution&quot;, ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 63.4, 633–644 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Raynal's prediction came true on the night of 21 August 1791, when the slaves of Saint Domingue rose in revolt {{why?|date=November 2016}} and plunged the colony into civil war. The signal to begin the revolt was given by [[Dutty Boukman]], a high priest of vodou and leader of the Maroon slaves, during a religious ceremony at [[Bois Caïman]] on the night of 14 August.&lt;ref&gt;Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity'', 123. ''Dutty Boukman'', Haitianite.com [http://www.haitianite.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an unprecedented slave revolt. Whites kept control of only a few isolated, fortified camps. The slaves sought revenge on their masters through &quot;pillage, rape, torture, mutilation, and death&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the plantation owners had long feared such a revolt, they were well armed and prepared to defend themselves. Nonetheless, within weeks, the number of slaves who joined the revolt reached some 100,000. Within the next two months, as the violence escalated, the slaves killed 4,000 whites and burned or destroyed 180 sugar plantations and hundreds of coffee and indigo plantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

By 1792, slave rebels controlled a third of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266962/Hispaniola |title=Hispaniola Article |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the slave rebellion caused the newly elected Legislative Assembly in France to realize it was facing an ominous situation. To protect France's economic interests, the Assembly granted civil and political rights to free men of color in the colonies {{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed to support the claim that this law was solely motivated by economic reasons|date=December 2011}} in March 1792.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Countries throughout Europe as well as the United States were shocked by the decision, but the Assembly was determined to stop the revolt. Apart from granting rights to the free people of color, the Assembly dispatched 6,000 French soldiers to the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;blackpast.org&quot;&gt;Blackpast.com [http://www.blackpast.org/?q=gah/haitian-revolution-1791-1804], Haitian Revolution 1791–1804&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1793, France declared war on Great Britain. The white planters in Saint Domingue made agreements with Great Britain to declare British sovereignty over the islands. Spain, who controlled the rest of the island of [[Hispaniola]], would also join the conflict and fight with Great Britain against France. The Spanish forces invaded Saint Domingue and were joined by the slave forces. For most of the conflict, the British and Spanish supplied the rebels with food, ammunition, arms, medicine, naval support, and military advisors. By August 1793, there were only 3,500 French soldiers on the island. To prevent military disaster, and secure the colony for republican France as opposed to Britain, Spain, and French royalists, separately or in combination, the French commissioners [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel]] freed the slaves in St. Domingue.

The decision was confirmed and extended by the [[National Convention]], the first elected Assembly of the First Republic (1792–1804), on the 4th of February 1794, under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre. It abolished slavery by law in France and all its colonies and granted civil and political rights to all black men in the colonies. The French constitutions of 1793 and 1795 both included the abolition of slavery. The constitution of 1793 was never applied, but that of 1795 was implemented and lasted until replaced by the consular and imperial constitutions under Napoleon Bonaparte. Despite racial tensions in Saint Domingue, the French revolutionary government at the time welcomed abolition with a show of idealism and optimism. The emancipation of slaves was viewed as an example of liberty for other countries, much as the American Revolution was meant to serve as the first of many liberation movements. Danton, one of the Frenchmen present at the meeting of the National Convention, expressed this sentiment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;representatives of the French people, until now our decrees of liberty have been selfish, and only for ourselves. But today we proclaim it to the universe, and generations to come will glory in this decree; we are proclaiming universal liberty...We are working for future generations; let us launch liberty into the colonies; the English are dead, today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Dubois and John D. Garrigus, &quot;Slave Revolution in the Caribbean: 1789–1804&quot;. Boston: Bedford/St. Martins, 2006. Document 26.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In nationalistic terms, the abolition of slavery also served as a moral triumph of France over England as seen in the latter half of the above quote. Yet the abolition of slavery did not allow for independence and did not persuade{{why?|date=November 2016}} [[Toussaint Louverture]] until some time later to stop working with the Spanish army.

It has recently been estimated that the slave rebellion resulted in the death of 350,000 Haitians and 50,000 European troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheina|first=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars, Vol. 1: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791–1899|year=2003|publisher=Brassey's|location=Washington, DC|isbn=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Encyclopedia of African American Politics'', &quot;Between 1791 and independence in 1804 nearly 200,000 blacks died, as did thousands of mulattoes and as many as 100,000 French and British soldiers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Robert C.

==Leadership of Louverture==
[[File:Général Toussaint Louverture.jpg|thumb|240px|left||[[Toussaint Louverture|General Toussaint Louverture]].]]

One of the most successful black commanders was [[Toussaint Louverture]], a self-educated former domestic slave. Like [[Jean-François Papillon|Jean François]] and [[Biassou]], he initially fought for the Spanish crown in this period. After the British had invaded Saint-Domingue, Louverture decided to fight for the French if they would agree to free all the slaves. [[Sonthonax]] had proclaimed an end to slavery on 29 August 1792. Louverture worked with a French general, Étienne Laveaux, to ensure that all slaves would be freed. Louverture abandoned the Spanish army in the east and brought his forces over to the French side on 6 May 1794 after the Spanish refused to take steps to end slavery.{{sfn|Bryan|1984|p=23}}

Under the military leadership of Toussaint, the forces made up mostly of former slaves succeeded in winning concessions from the British and expelling the Spanish forces. In the end, Toussaint essentially restored control of Saint-Domingue to France. Louverture was very intelligent, organized and articulate. Having made himself master of the island, however, Toussaint did not wish to surrender too much power to France. He began to rule the country as an effectively autonomous entity. Louverture overcame a succession of local rivals (including the Commissioner Sonthonax, a French white man who gained support from many Haitians, angering Louverture; [[André Rigaud]], a free man of color who fought to keep control of the South in the [[War of Knives]]; and [[Comte d'Hédouville]]). Hédouville forced a fatal wedge between Rigaud and Louverture before he escaped to France. Toussaint defeated a British expeditionary force in 1798. In addition, he led an invasion of neighboring Santo Domingo ''(December 1800)'', and freed the slaves there on January 3, 1801.

In 1801, Louverture issued a constitution for Saint-Domingue that decreed he would be governor-for-life and called for black autonomy and a sovereign black state. In response, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] dispatched a [[Saint-Domingue expedition|large expeditionary force]] of French soldiers and warships to the island, led by Bonaparte's brother-in-law [[Charles Leclerc]], to restore French rule. They were under secret instructions to restore slavery, at least in the formerly Spanish-held part of the island. The numerous French soldiers were accompanied by mulatto troops led by [[Alexandre Pétion]] and André Rigaud, mulatto leaders who had been defeated by Toussaint three years earlier. During the struggles, some of Toussaint's closest allies, including [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], defected to Leclerc.

Louverture was promised his freedom if he agreed to integrate his remaining troops into the French army. Louverture agreed to this in May 1802. He was later deceived, seized by the French and shipped to France. He died months later in prison at [[Fort-de-Joux]] in the Jura region.&lt;ref name=&quot;kreyol-004&quot;/&gt;

==Resistance to slavery==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
[[Image:Haitian revolution.jpg|thumb|Battle at &quot;Snake Gully&quot; in 1802]]
For a few months, the island was quiet under Napoleonic rule. But when it became apparent that the French intended to re-establish slavery (because they had nearly done so on [[Guadeloupe]]), black cultivators revolted in the summer of 1802. Dessalines and Pétion remained allied with France until they switched sides again, in October 1802, and fought against the French. In November, Leclerc died of [[yellow fever]], like much of his army.&lt;ref name=&quot;kreyol-004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Philippe R. Girard| title = The Slaves Who Defeated Napoleon Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian War of Independence, 1801–1804| year = 2011| publisher = University of Alabama Press| isbn = 0-8173-1732-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His successor, the [[Vicomte de Rochambeau]], fought an even more brutal campaign. His atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Having sold the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon began to lose interest in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere. He was more concerned about France's European enemies such as Great Britain and Prussia. With that, he withdrew a majority of the French forces in Haiti to counter the possibility of an invasion from Prussia, Britain, and Spain on a weakened France.

{{further|Blockade of Saint-Domingue}}
With Napoleon's inability to send the requested massive reinforcements after the outbreak of war on 18 May 1803 with the British - the Royal Navy immediately despatched a squadron under Sir [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|John Duckworth]] from Jamaica to cruise in the region, seeking to eliminate communication between the French outposts and to capture or destroy the French warships based in the colony.

The Royal Navy squadrons soon blockaded the French-held ports of Cap Français and Môle-Saint-Nicolas on the Northern coast of the French colony. In the summer of 1803, when war broke out between the United Kingdom and the French Consulate, Saint-Domingue had been almost completely overrun by Haitian forces under the command of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]]. In the north of the country, the French forces were isolated in the two large ports of [[Cap Français]] and [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas]] and a few smaller settlements, all supplied by a French naval force based primarily at Cap Français.

On 28 June, the squadron encountered a French convoy from Les Cayes off Môle-Saint-Nicolas, capturing one ship although the other escaped. Two days later an independently sailing French frigate was chased down and captured in the same waters. On 24 July another British squadron intercepted the main French squadron from Cap Français, which was attempting to break past the blockade and reach France. The British, led by Commodore [[John Loring (Royal Navy officer, died 1808)|John Loring]] gave chase, but one French ship of the line and a frigate escaped. Another ship of the line was trapped against the coast and captured after coming under fire from Haitian shore batteries. The remainder of the squadron was forced to fight two more actions on their return to Europe, but did eventually reach the Spanish port of [[A Coruña|Corunna]].

On 3 November, the frigate HMS Blanche captured a supply schooner near Cap Français, the last hope in supplying the French forces. The last battle on land of the Haitian Revolution, the [[Battle of Vertières]], occurred on 18 November 1803, near Cap-Haïtien fought between Dessalines' army and the remaining French colonial army under the Vicomte de Rochambeau; the slave rebels and freed revolutionary soldiers won the battle.

Rochambeau seeing defeat inevitable procrastinated until the last possible moment, but eventually was forced to surrender to the British commander - by the end of the month the garrison was starving. Commodore Loring however refused the French permission to sail and agreed terms with Dessalines that permitted them to safely evacuate provided they had left the port by 1 December. One of Rochambeau's ships was almost wrecked while leaving the harbour, but was saved by a British lieutenant acting alone, who not only rescued the 900 people on board, but also refloated the ship. At Môle-Saint-Nicolas, General Louis de Noailles refused to surrender and instead sailed to Havana, Cuba in a fleet of small vessels on 3 December, but was intercepted and mortally wounded by a Royal Navy frigate. Soon after with the few remaining French-held towns in Saint-Domingue surrendered soon afterwards to the Royal Navy to prevent massacres by the Haitian army. Meanwhile, Dessalines led the rebellion until its completion, when the French forces were finally defeated by the end of 1803.&lt;ref name=&quot;kreyol-004&quot;/&gt;

On 1 January 1804, from the city of [[Gonaïves]], Dessalines officially declared the former colony's independence, renaming it &quot;Haiti&quot; after the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] name. Although he lasted from 1804 to 1806, several changes began taking place in Haiti. The independence of Haiti was a major blow to France and its colonial empire, but the French state would take several decades to recognize the loss of the colony.
[[Image:Haitian Revolution.jpg|thumb|Battle of Vertières in 1803]]

==Free republic==
On 1 January 1804, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], the new leader under the dictatorial 1805 constitution, declared Haiti a free republic in the name of the Haitian people,&lt;ref&gt;Haitian Declaration of Independence: ''Liberty or Death: Indigent Army,'' by the General in Chief Dessalines, in the name of the Haitian people. Held in the British National Archives: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/dol/images/examples/haiti/0001.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by the [[1804 Haiti massacre|massacre of the remaining whites]].&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Girard, “Jean-Jacques Dessalines and the Atlantic System: A Reappraisal,” William and Mary Quarterly (July 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Dessalines' secretary [[Boisrond-Tonnerre]] stated, &quot;For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;haiti&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ht0019) Independent Haiti], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti was the first independent nation in Latin America, the first post-colonial independent black-led nation in the world, and the only nation whose independence was gained as part of a successful slave rebellion. The country was crippled by years of war, its agriculture devastated, its formal commerce nonexistent.&lt;ref name=&quot;kreyol-005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kreyol.com/history005.html|title=Independent Haiti|accessdate=27 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ch6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/httoc.html#ht0013|title=Chapter 6 – &quot;Haiti: Historical Setting&quot;, in ''A Country Study: Haiti''|author=Anne Greene|publisher=&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt;Federal Research Service of Library of Congress|date=1988–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country, therefore, had to be rebuilt.

To realise this goal Dessalines adopted the economic organisation of serfdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Leyburn 1961&quot;&gt;James Leyburn, The Haitian People, Yale University Press, 1961, 34&lt;/ref&gt; He proclaimed that every citizen would belong to one of two categories, laborer or soldier.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Leyburn 1961&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, he proclaimed the mastery of the state over the individual and consequently ordered that all laborers would be bound to a plantation.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Leyburn 1961&quot;/&gt;

To avoid the appearance of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, the whip.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Leyburn 1961&quot;/&gt; Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Leyburn 1961&quot;/&gt; Dessalines' chief motivator nonetheless was production and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations' overseers. Barred from using the whip, many instead turned to lianes, which were thick vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers to keep working.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Leyburn 1961&quot;/&gt; Dessalines effectively sent the Haitian people back into slavery. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the countryside and in raising production levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Leyburn 1961&quot;/&gt;

Fearing a return of French forces, Dessalines first expanded and maintained a significant military force. During his reign, nearly 10% of able-bodied men were in active service.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;James Leyburn, The Haitian People, Yale University Press, 1961, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Dessalines ordered the construction of massive fortifications throughout the island, like the [[Citadelle Laferrière]]. Many commentators believe that this overmilitarization contributed to many of Haiti's future problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; In fact, because young fit men were the most likely to be drafted into the army, the plantations were thus deprived of the workforce needed to function properly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

Under the presidency of [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], Haiti made reparations to French slaveholders in 1825 in the amount of 150&amp;nbsp;million francs, reduced in 1838 to 60&amp;nbsp;million francs, in exchange for French recognition of its independence. Boyer believed that the constant threat of a French invasion was stymieing the Haitian economy and thus felt the need to settle the matter once and for all.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;James Leyburn, The Haitian People, Yale University Press, 1961, 70&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations for the indemnity were rather one sided however as French warships were anchored off the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; The resulting indemnity bankrupted the Haitian treasury. Haiti was therefore forced to take out a loan from French banks, who provided the funds for the large first installment,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; severely affecting Haiti's ability to prosper. Haitian forces, led by Boyer, invaded neighboring [[Spanish Haiti|Dominican Republic]] in February 1822—beginning a 22-year occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/4.htm |title=Dominican Republic – Haiti and Santo Domingo |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Haitian Revolution in 1804 marked the end of colonialism on the island. However, the social conflict cultivated under slavery continued to affect the population for years to come. The revolution left in place the ''[[affranchi]]'' élite, who continued to rule Haiti while the formidable Haitian army kept them in power. France continued the slavery system in French Guiana, [[Martinique]], and [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;caribbean2&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Knight| first = Franklin W.| title = The Caribbean The Genesis of a Fragmented Nationalism| edition = 2nd| year = 1990| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-505441-5| page = 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During February and March, Dessalines traveled among the cities of Haiti to assure himself that his orders were carried out. Despite his orders, the massacres were often not carried out until he personally visited the cities.{{sfn|Popkin|2012|p=137}}

The course of the massacre showed an almost identical pattern in every city he visited.

Reportedly, he also ordered the unwilling to take part in the killings, especially men of mixed race, so that blame would not rest solely on the black population.{{sfn|Dayan|1998|p={{page needed|date=February 2012}}}}{{sfn|Girard|2011|p=321}} Mass killings then took place on the streets and on places outside the cities.

Women and children were generally killed last. White women were &quot;often raped or pushed into forced marriages under threat of death&quot;.{{sfn|Girard|2011|pp=321}}

By the end of April 1804, some 3,000 to 5,000 persons had been killed{{sfn|Girard|2011|p=322}} practically eradicating the country's white population. Dessalines had specifically stated that France is &quot;the real enemy of the new nation.&quot; This allowed certain categories of whites to be excluded from massacre who had to pledge their rejection to France: the Polish soldiers who deserted from the French army; the group of German colonists of the [[Nord-Ouest Department|Nord-Ouest]] (North-West) department of Haiti who were inhabitants before the revolution; French widows who were allowed to keep their property;&lt;ref name=&quot;Land&quot;/&gt; select male Frenchmen;{{sfn|Girard|2011|p=325}} and a group of medical doctors and professionals.{{sfn|Popkin|2012|p=137}} Reportedly, also people with connections to Haitian notables were spared,{{sfn|Girard|2011|p=321}} as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men.{{sfn|Girard|2011|p=322}} In the 1805 constitution that declared all its citizens as ''black'',{{sfn|Girard|2011|p=325}} it specifically mentions the naturalizations of German and Polish peoples enacted by the government, as being exempt from Article XII that prohibited whites (&quot;non-Haitians;&quot; foreigners) from owning land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmer&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Girard|2011|p=322}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Findlay; Holdsworth&quot;/&gt;

Ultimately, the massacre had a long-lasting effect on the view of the Haitian Revolution and helped to create a legacy of racial hostility in Haitian society.{{sfn|Girard|2011|p=325}}

==Impact==
Historians continue to debate the importance of the Haitian Revolution. David Geggus asks: &quot;How much of a difference did it make?&quot; A limited amount, he concludes, for slavery flourished in the western hemisphere for many more decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Patrick Geggus and Norman Fiering, eds|title=The World of the Haitian Revolution|year=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians say the Haitian Revolution influenced slave rebellions in the United States and British colonies. The biggest [[slave revolt]] in U.S. history was the [[1811 German Coast Uprising]] in Louisiana. This slave rebellion was put down and the punishment the slaves received was so severe that no contemporary news reports about it exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rasmussen|first=Daniel|title=American Uprising: The Untold Story of America's Largest Slave Revolt|year=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighboring revolution brought the slavery question to the forefront of U.S. politics, and the resulting intensification of racial divides and sectional politics ended the idealism of the Revolutionary period.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Simon P. &quot;American Political Culture and the French and Haitian Revolutions: Nathaniel Cutting and the Jeffersonian Republicans.&quot; ''The Impact of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World''. Ed. David P. Geggus. (University of South Carolina Press 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fire in Saint-Domingo 1791, German copper engraving.jpg|thumb|240px|Saint-Domingue slave revolt in 1791]]
Beginning during the slave insurrections of 1791, white refugees from Saint-Domingue fled to the United States, particularly to Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, and Charleston. The immigration intensified after the journée (crisis) of June 20, 1793, and soon American families began to raise money and open up their homes to help exiles in what became the United States' first refugee crisis. While some white refugees blamed the French Revolutionary government for sparking the violence in Haiti, many supported the Republican regime and openly expressed their support of the [[Jacobins]]&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Jeremy D. 'You Are All Free: The Haitian Revolution and the Abolition of Slavery. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some historical evidence suggesting that displaying solidarity with the French Revolution was the easiest way for the refugees to earn the support and sympathy of the Americans, who had just recently lived through their own revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, page 298.&lt;/ref&gt; American slaveholders, in particular, commiserated with the French planters who had been forcibly removed from their plantations in Saint-Domingue. While the exiles found themselves in a peaceful situation in the United States — safe from the violence raging in both France and Haiti — their presence complicated the already precarious diplomatic relations among Britain, France and the U.S.

Many of the whites and [[free people of color]] who left Saint-Domingue for the United States settled in southern Louisiana, adding many new members to its French-speaking, mixed-race, and black populations. The exiles causing the greatest amount of alarm were the African slaves who came with their refugee owners. Some southern planters grew concerned that the presence of these slaves who had witnessed the revolution in Haiti would ignite similar revolts in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, David Brion. &quot;Impact of the French and Haitian Revolutions.&quot; The Impact of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World. Ed. David P. Geggus. (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; However other planters were confident they had the situation under control.&lt;ref&gt;Ashli White, ''Encountering Revolution: Haiti and the Making of the Early Republic'' (2010) p 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807 Haiti was divided into two parts, the Republic of Haiti in the south, and the Kingdom of Haiti in the north. Land could not be privately owned; it reverted to the State through ''Biens Nationaux'' (national bonds), and no French whites could own land. The remaining French settlers were forced to leave the island. Those who refused were slaughtered. The Haitian State owned up to 90% of the land and the other 10% was leased in 5-year intervals.

Since the resistance and the murderous disease environment made it impossible for Napoleon to regain control over Haiti, he gave up hope of rebuilding a French New World empire. He decided to sell Louisiana to the Americans. The Haitian Revolution brought about two unintended consequences: the creation of a continental America and the virtual end of Napoleonic rule in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James A. Henretta|title=America's History, Volume 1: To 1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PmY3sBubw8C&amp;pg=PA220|year=2011|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|page=220|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There never again was such a large-scale slave rebellion. Napoleon reversed the French abolition of slavery in law, constitution, and practice, which had occurred between 1793 and 1801, and reinstated slavery in the French colonies in 1801–1803—which lasted until 1848.

==The Revolution and the media==
The revolution of African slaves brought many fears to colonies surrounding Haiti and the Caribbean. Prominent wealthy [[Slavery in the United States|American slave owners]], reading about the revolution, also read speculation about what might come in [[U.S. state|their own states]]. However, newspapers like the ''Colombian Centinel'' took the extra steps to support the revolution, in the sense that it was based on the foundations of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;columbiancentinelrevolution&quot;&gt;Matthewson, Tim, 1996 ''Jefferson and the Nonrecognition of Haiti'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The French media also played an important role in the Haitian Revolution, with contributions that made many French upstarts quite interested in the young, passionate Toussaint's writings of freedom.

However, all was not simple in the press. A top critic who significantly drove Toussaint into fear of backlash from France was [[Sonthonax]], who was responsible for many outlooks of Haiti in the French newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;beyondtheslavenarrative:politics,sex,andmanuscriptsinthehaitianrevolution&quot;&gt;Jenson, ''The Sonthonax Drama: Toussaint as Political Dramaturge'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Sonthonax was one of the few contenders who truly pushed for the independence of the African slaves and became a major factor in Toussaint's decision of declaring independence from France.

==In popular culture==
* Cuban writer [[Alejo Carpentier]]'s second novel, ''[[The Kingdom of This World]]'' (1949), (translated into English 1957), explores the Haitian Revolution in depth. It is one of the novels that inaugurated the Latin American renaissance in fiction beginning in the mid-20th century.
* [[Madison Smartt Bell]] has written a trilogy called ''[[All Souls' Rising]]'' (1995) about the life of Toussaint Louverture and the slave uprising.
* C. Richard Gillespie, former [[Towson University]] professor, wrote a novelization of Louverture's life in the Revolution titled ''[[Papa Toussaint]]'' (1998).
* Though not referred to by name, Haiti is the backdrop for the 1990 Broadway musical ''[[Once on This Island]]'' by [[Lynn Ahrens]] and [[Stephen Flaherty]]. The musical, based on the novel ''My Love, My Love'' by [[Rosa Guy]], describes the social stratification of the island, and contains a song that briefly outlines the history of the Haitian Revolution.
* In 2004 an exhibition of paintings entitled ''Caribbean Passion: Haiti 1804'' by artist [[Kimathi Donkor]], was held in London to celebrate the bicentenary of Haiti's revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Melbourne|first1=Kamali|title=Caribbean Passion : Haiti 1804|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/10/28/caribbean_passion_haiti_1804_event_feature.shtml|website=BBC Nottingham|accessdate=22 August 2016|date=31 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2010, author [[Isabel Allende]] wrote a historical novel entitled ''[[Island Beneath the Sea]]'', which documents the Haitian Revolution through the eyes of a slave woman living on the island.
* [[William Dietrich (novelist)|William Dietrich]] set his 2012 novel, ''The Emerald Storm'' during the Haitian Revolution.
* The television mini-series [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255730 ''The Feast of All Saints''] features the Haitian Revolution in its opening scene.
* The film [[Top Five]] refers to a fictional film within the film called &quot;Uprize&quot;, ostensibly about this revolution.
* The role of Bois Caiman, Boukman, and Vodou generally, would become the subject of a controversial, discredited neo-evangelical theology in the 1990s that insisted that Haiti was pledged to the devil during the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From Slave Revolt to a Blood Pact with Satan: The Evangelical Rewriting of Haitian History|url = http://sir.sagepub.com/content/41/2/187|journal = Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses|date = 2012-06-01|issn = 0008-4298|pages = 187–215|volume = 41|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0008429812441310|first = Elizabeth|last = McAlister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Empire won early military victories in the [[War of the Third Coalition]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], and allied nations, notably at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in 1805&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Battle of Austerlitz |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/43578/Battle-of-Austerlitz |website=Britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=15 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], at the [[Battle of Friedland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hickman |first1=Kennedy |title=Napoleonic Wars: Battle of Friedland |url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/napoleonicwars/p/battle-of-friedland.htm |website=militaryhistory.about.com |publisher=about.com |accessdate=15 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1807.

A series of wars, known collectively as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], extended French influence over much of Western Europe and into Poland. At its height in 1812, the French Empire had [[130 departments of the First French Empire|130 departments]], ruled over 70 million subjects, maintained an extensive military presence in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Spain]], and the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and could count Prussia and Austria as nominal allies.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Lyons, ''Napoleon Bonaparte and the Legacy of the French Revolution.'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Early French victories exported many ideological features of the French Revolution throughout Europe: the introduction of the [[Napoleonic Code]] throughout the continent increased legal equality, established jury systems and legalised divorce, and [[manorialism|seigneurial dues and seigneurial justice]] were abolished, as were aristocratic privileges in all places with the exception of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Lyons p. 234–36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{Main article|18 Brumaire|French Consulate}}
In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte was confronted by [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès]] – one of five [[French Directory|Directors]] constituting the executive branch of the French government—who sought his support for a ''coup d'état'' to overthrow the [[Constitution of the Year III]]. The plot included Bonaparte's brother [[Lucien Bonaparte|Lucien]], then serving as speaker of the [[Council of Five Hundred]], [[Roger Ducos]], another Director, and [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]]. On 9 November 1799 ([[18 Brumaire]] (VIII under the [[French Republican Calendar]])) and the following day, troops led by Bonaparte seized control{{clarify|date=May 2016}}. They dispersed the legislative councils, leaving a rump legislature to name Bonaparte, Sieyès and Ducos as provisional Consuls to administer the government. Although Sieyès expected to dominate the new regime, the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], he was outmaneuvered by Bonaparte, who drafted the [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] and secured his own election as First Consul. He thus became the most powerful person in France, a power that was increased by the [[Constitution of the Year X]], which made him First Consul for life.

The [[Battle of Marengo]] (14 June 1800) inaugurated the political idea that was to continue its development until Napoleon's Moscow campaign. Napoleon planned only to keep the [[Duchy of Milan]] for France, setting aside Austria, and was thought{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to prepare a new campaign in the East. The [[Peace of Amiens]], which cost him control of [[Egypt]], was a temporary truce. He gradually extended his authority in Italy by annexing the [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] and by acquiring [[Genoa]], [[Parma]], Tuscany and [[Naples]], and added this Italian territory to his [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Then he laid siege to the Roman state and initiated the [[Concordat of 1801]] to control the material claims of the [[pope]]. When he recognised his error of raising the authority of the pope from that of a figurehead, Napoleon produced the ''[[Organic Articles|Articles Organiques]]'' (1802) wanting, like [[Charlemagne]], to be the legal protector of the papacy. To conceal his plans before their actual execution, he aroused French colonial aspirations against Britain and the memory of the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], exacerbating British envy of France, whose borders now extended to the [[Rhine]] and beyond, to [[Hanover]], Hamburg and [[Cuxhaven]].  Napoleon would have ruling elites from a fusion of the new bourgeoisie and the old aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|pages=92|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 1802, the French [[Tribunat]] voted unanimously, with exception of [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]], in favour of the Life Consulship for the leader of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fremont-Barnes|first1=Gregory|title=The encyclopedia of the French revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars: a political, social, and military history, Volume 1|date=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1851096466|page=211|quote=Elected to the Tribunate in 1802, he [Carnot] showed himself increasingly alienated by Napoleon's personal ambition and voted against both the Consul for Life and the proclamation of the Empire.

A general [[plebiscite]] followed thereafter resulting in 3,653,600 votes aye and 8,272 votes nay.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin des Lois&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 1802 (14 Thermidor, An X), Napoleon Bonaparte was proclaimed Consul for life.

Pro-revolutionary sentiment swept through Germany aided by the &quot;Recess of 1803&quot;, which brought [[Bavaria]], [[Württemberg]] and [[Baden, Germany|Baden]] to France's side. [[William Pitt the Younger]], back in power over Britain, appealed once more for an Anglo-Austro-Russian [[coalition]] against Napoleon to stop the ideals of revolutionary France from spreading.

[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]]'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], 1806]] 
On 18 May 1804, Napoleon was given the title of emperor by the [[French Consulate#The New Government|Senate]]; finally, on 2 December 1804, he was [[Coronation of Napoleon I|solemnly crowned]], after receiving the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] of the [[Kings of the Lombards|Lombard kings]], and was consecrated by [[Pope Pius VII]] in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].{{ref|Note 3|Note 3}}

In four campaigns, the Emperor transformed his &quot;[[Charlemagne|Carolingian]]&quot; [[feudal]] and [[Federation|federal]] empire into one modelled on the [[Roman Empire]]. The memories of imperial Rome were for a third time, after [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Charlemagne]], used to modify the historical evolution of France. Though the vague plan for an invasion of Britain was never executed, the [[Battle of Ulm]] and the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] overshadowed the defeat of [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and the camp at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] put at Napoleon's disposal the best military resources he had commanded, in the form of ''[[La Grande Armée]]''.

[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Battle of Austerlitz]]

==Early victories==
In the [[War of the Third Coalition]], Napoleon swept away the remnants of the old [[Holy Roman Empire]] and created in [[southern Germany]] the [[vassal state]]s of [[Bavaria]], [[Baden]], [[Württemberg]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and [[Saxony]], which were reorganized into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. The [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], signed on 26 December 1805, did little other than create a more unified Germany to threaten France.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} On the other hand, Napoleon's creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the occupation of [[Ancona]], and his annexation of [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] and its former [[Adriatic]] territories marked a new stage in his Empire's progress.

To create [[satellite state]]s, Napoleon installed his relatives as rulers of many European states. The [[Bonaparte dynasty|Bonapartes]] began to marry into old European monarchies, gaining sovereignty over many nations. [[Joseph Bonaparte]] replaced the dispossessed [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] in Naples; [[Louis Bonaparte]] was installed on the throne of the [[Kingdom of Holland]], formed from the [[Batavian Republic]]; [[Joachim Murat]] became Grand-Duke of [[Berg (earldom)|Berg]]; [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] was made son-in-law to the King of Württemberg; and Eugène de Beauharnais was appointed to be the King of Bavaria while [[Stéphanie de Beauharnais]] married the son of the Grand Duke of Baden. In addition to the vassal titles, Napoleon's closest relatives were also granted the title of [[Nobility of the First French Empire|French Prince]] and formed the [[Imperial House of France (First French Empire)|Imperial House of France]].

Met with opposition, Napoleon would not tolerate any neutral power. On 6 August 1806 the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] abdicated their title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in order to prevent Napoleon from becoming the next Emperor, ending a political power which had endured for over a thousand years. Prussia had been offered the territory of [[Hannover|Hanover]] to stay out of the Third Coalition. With the diplomatic situation changing, Napoleon offered Great Britain the province as part of a peace proposal. This, combined with growing tensions in Germany over French hegemony, Prussia responded by forming an alliance with Russia and sending troops into Bavaria on 1 October 1806. In this [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], Napoleon destroyed the armies of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William]] at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]]. The [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and the [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] against the Russians finally ruined [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]'s formerly mighty kingdom, obliging [[Russia]] and Prussia to make peace with France at [[Treaties of Tilsit|Tilsit]].

==Height of the Empire==
[[File:Paris July 2011-30.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'', ordered by [[Napoleon]] in honour of his ''[[Grande Armée]]'', is one of the several landmarks whose construction was started in Paris during the First French Empire.]]

The [[Treaties of Tilsit]] ended the war between  [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and the French Empire and began an alliance between the two empires that held power of much of the rest of Europe. The two empires secretly agreed to aid each other in disputes. France pledged to aid Russia against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkey]], while Russia agreed to join the [[Continental System]] against the [[British Empire]]. Napoleon also forced Alexander to enter the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807–12)|Anglo-Russian War]] and to instigate the [[Finnish War]] against Sweden in order to force Sweden to join the Continental System.

More specifically, the Tsar agreed to evacuate [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], which had been occupied by Russian forces as part of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)|Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812]]. The [[Ionian Islands]] and [[Cattaro]], which had been captured by Russian admirals [[Fyodor Ushakov|Ushakov]] and [[Dmitry Senyavin|Senyavin]], were to be handed over to the French. In recompense, Napoleon guaranteed the sovereignty of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg]] and several other small states ruled by the Tsar's German relatives.

The treaty removed about half of [[Prussia]]'s territory: [[Kottbus]] passed to [[Saxony]], the left bank of the [[Elbe]] was awarded to the newly created [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], [[Białystok]] was given to Russia, and the rest of Polish lands in the Prussian possession were set up as the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. Prussia was ordered to reduce their army to 40,000 and to pay an indemnity of 100,000,000 francs. Observers in Prussia viewed the treaty as unfair and as a national humiliation.
[[File:Iena.jpg|thumb|Napoleon reviews the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] before the [[Battle of Jena]], 1806]]

[[Talleyrand]] had advised Napoleon to pursue milder terms; the treaties marked an important stage in his estrangement from the emperor. After the Treaties of Tilsit, instead of trying to reconcile Europe, as Talleyrand had advised, Napoleon wanted to defeat Britain and complete his Italian dominion. To the coalition of the northern powers, he added the league of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and Mediterranean ports, and to the bombardment of [[Copenhagen]] by a [[Royal Navy]] fleet he responded by a second decree of blockade, dated from Milan on 17 December 1807.

The application of the Concordat and the taking of Naples led to the first struggles with the Pope, centered around  [[Pius VII]] renewing the theocratic affirmations of [[Pope Gregory VII]]. The Emperor's Roman ambition was made more visible by the occupation of the Kingdom of Naples and of the [[Marches]], and by the entry of [[Sextius Alexandre François de Miollis|Miollis]] into Rome; while [[Jean-Andoche Junot|Junot]] invaded Portugal, [[Joachim Murat]] [[Peninsular War|took control]] of formerly Roman Spain, whither Joseph Bonaparte transferred afterwards.

Napoleon tried to succeed in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as he had done in Italy, in the Netherlands, and in Hesse. However, the exile of the Royal Family to [[Bayonne]], together with the enthroning of Joseph Bonaparte, turned the Spanish against Napoleon. After the [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|Dos de Mayo]] riots and subsequent reprisals, The Spanish government began an effective guerrilla campaign, under the oversight of a local ''Juntas''. The Peninsula became a war zone from the Pyrenees to the Straits of Gibraltar and saw Imperial Armies facing the remnants of the Spanish Army, as well as British and Portuguese Forces. [[Pierre Dupont de l'Étang|Dupont]] capitulated at [[Battle of Bailén|Bailén]] to [[Francisco Javier Castaños, 1st Duke of Bailén|General Castaños]], and [[Andoche Junot, Duke of Abrantes|Junot]] at [[Convention of Sintra|Sintra]], Portugal to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General Wellesley]].

[[File:Gros, Napoleon at Eylau.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the [[Battle of Eylau]], 1807]]
Spain used up the soldiers needed for Napoleon's other fields of battle, and they had to be replaced by conscripts. Spanish resistance affected Austria, and indicated the potential of national resistance. The provocations of Talleyrand and Britain strengthened the idea that Austrians could emulate the Spaniards. On April 10, 1809, Austria invaded France's ally, Bavaria. The campaign of 1809, however, would not be nearly as long and troublesome for France as the Spanish one.  After a short and decisive action in Bavaria, Napoleon opened up the road to [[Vienna]] for a second time. At [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]], Napoleon suffered his first serious tactical defeat, along with the death of [[Jean Lannes]], an able Marshall and dear friend of the Emperor. The victory at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], however, forced Austria to sue for peace. The [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]], 14 December 1809, annexed the [[Illyrian Provinces]] and recognized past French conquests.

The Pope was forcibly deported to [[Savona]], and his domains were incorporated into the Empire. The Senate's decision on 17 February 1810 created the title of King of Rome, and made Rome the capital of Italy. Between 1810 and 1812 Napoleon's divorce of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]], and his marriage with [[Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria]], followed by the birth of the [[Napoleon II|king of Rome]], shed light upon his future policy. He gradually withdrew power from his siblings and concentrated his affection and ambition on his son, the guarantee of the continuance of his dynasty. This was the high point of the empire.

==Intrigues and unrest==
Undermining forces, however, had already begun to impinge on the faults inherent in Napoleon’s achievements. Britain, protected by the English Channel and its navy, was [[Golden Cavalry of St George|persistently active]], and rebellion of both the governing and of the governed broke out everywhere. Napoleon, though he underrated it, soon felt his failure in coping with the Spanish uprising.  Men like [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl, baron von und zum Stein|Baron von Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg|August von Hardenberg]] and [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Johann von Scharnhorst]] had secretly started preparing Prussia's retaliation.

[[File:Тильзит. 1807.jpg|thumb|210px|Napoleon demanded that [[Alexander I of Russia]] and [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] meet him at [[Treaties of Tilsit|Tilsit]] in July 1807]]
The alliance arranged at Tilsit was seriously shaken by the Austrian marriage, the threat of Polish restoration to Russia, and the Continental System. The very persons whom he had placed in power were counteracting his plans.  With many of his siblings and relations performing unsuccessfully or even betraying him, Napoleon found himself obliged to revoke their power. [[Caroline Bonaparte]] conspired against her brother and against her husband Murat; the hypochondriac Louis, now Dutch in his sympathies, found the supervision of the blockade taken from him, and also the defense of the [[Scheldt]], which he had refused to ensure.  [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] lost control of the blockade on [[North Sea]] shores. The very nature of things was against the new dynasties, as it had been against the old.

After national insurrections and family recriminations came treachery from Napoleon's ministers. Talleyrand betrayed his designs to [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] and suffered dismissal.  [[Joseph Fouché]], corresponding with Austria in 1809 and 1810, entered into an understanding with Louis and also with Britain, while [[Bourrienne]] was convicted of speculation. By consequence of the spirit of conquest Napoleon had aroused, many of his marshals and officials, having tasted victory, dreamed of sovereign power: [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Bernadotte]], who had helped him to the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], played Napoleon false to win the crown of Sweden.  [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Soult]], like Murat, coveted the Spanish throne after that of Portugal, thus anticipating the treason of 1812.

The country itself, though flattered by conquests, was tired of self-sacrifice.  The unpopularity of [[conscription]] policies gradually turned many of Napoleon’s subjects against him. Amidst profound silence from the press and the assemblies, a protest was raised against imperial power by the literary world, against the excommunicated sovereign by Catholicism, and against the author of the continental blockade by the discontented [[bourgeoisie]], ruined by the crisis of 1811.  Even as he lost his military principles, Napoleon maintained his gift for brilliance. His [[Six Days Campaign]], which took place at the very end of the [[Sixth Coalition]], is often regarded as his greatest display of leadership and military prowess. But by then it was the end (or &quot;the finish&quot;), and it was during the years before when the nations of Europe conspired against France.  While the Emperor and his holdings idled and worsened, the rest of Europe agreed to avenge the revolutionary events of 1792.

==The Fall==
{{Main article|Napoleon's Invasion of Russia|Sixth Coalition|Hundred Days}}
[[File:Meissonier - 1814, Campagne de France.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Napoleon and his staff during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], 1812–14.]]
Napoleon had hardly succeeded in putting down the revolt in Germany when the Tsar of Russia himself headed a European insurrection against Napoleon. To put a stop to this, to ensure his own access to the Mediterranean and exclude his chief rival, Napoleon made an effort in 1812 against Russia. Despite his victorious advance, the [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|taking of Smolensk]], the victory on the [[Battle of Borodino|Moskva]], and the entry into Moscow, he was defeated by the country and the climate, and by Alexander's refusal to make terms. After this came the terrible retreat in the harsh Russian winter, while all Europe was concentrating against him. Pushed back, as he had been in Spain, from bastion to bastion, after the action on the [[Berezina]], Napoleon had to fall back upon the frontiers of 1809, and then—having refused the peace offered to him by Austria at the [[Congress of Prague]] (4 June–10 August 1813), from a dread of losing Italy, where each of his victories had marked a stage in the accomplishment of his dream—on those of 1805, despite [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Lützen]] and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]], and on those of 1802 after his defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], when [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]] – now Crown Prince of Sweden – turned upon him, [[Jean Victor Moreau|General Moreau]] also joined the Allies, and longstanding allied nations, such as [[Saxony]] and [[Bavaria]], forsook him as well.

Following his retreat from Russia, Napoleon continued to retreat, this time from Germany. After the loss of Spain, reconquered by an allied army led by [[Duke of Wellington|Wellington]], the rising in the Netherlands preliminary to the invasion and the [[manifesto of Frankfort]] (1 December 1813)&lt;ref&gt;The Frankfort Declaration, 1 December 1813: http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_frankfort.html&lt;/ref&gt; which proclaimed it, he had to fall back upon the frontiers of 1795; and then later was driven yet farther back upon those of 1792—despite the brilliant [[Campaign in north-east France (1814)|campaign of 1814 against the invaders]]. Paris capitulated on 30 March 1814, and the [[Carthago delenda est|''Delenda Carthago'']], pronounced against Britain, was spoken of Napoleon. The Empire briefly fell with Napoleon's abdication at [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Fontainebleau]] on 11 April 1814.

After a brief exile at the island of [[Elba]], Napoleon escaped, with a ship, a few men, and four cannons. The King sent Marshal Ney to arrest him.  Upon meeting Ney's army, Napoleon dismounted and walked into firing range, saying &quot;If one of you wishes to kill his emperor, here I am!&quot; But instead of firing, they went to join Napoleon's side shouting &quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot;  Napoleon recaptured the throne temporarily in 1815, reviving the Empire in what is known as the [[Hundred Days]]. However, he was defeated by the Seventh Coalition at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. He surrendered himself to the Coalition and was exiled to [[Saint Helena]], a remote island in the South Atlantic, where he remained until his death in 1821. After the Hundred Days (just less than a third of a year), the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon monarchy was restored]], with [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] regaining the throne of France, while the rest of Napoleon's conquests were disposed of in the [[Congress of Vienna]].

==Nature of Bonaparte's rule==
[[File:Constitution an VIII et le Empire Francais.png|thumb|center|600px|Organigramme of the Consulate and later the Empire]]
[[File:Speyer (DerHexer) 2010-12-19 051.jpg|thumb|The [[Napoleonic Code]].]]
Napoleon gained support by appealing to some common concerns of French people. These included dislike of the emigrant [[nobility]] who had escaped persecution, fear by some of a restoration of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', a dislike and suspicion of foreign countries that had tried to reverse the Revolution – and a wish by Jacobins to extend France's revolutionary ideals.

Napoleon attracted power and imperial status and gathered support for his changes of French institutions, such as the [[Concordat of 1801]] which confirmed the Catholic Church as the majority church of France and restored some of its civil status.
Napoleon by this time however was not a democrat, nor a republican. He was, he liked to think, an enlightened despot, the sort of man [[Voltaire]] might have found appealing. He preserved numerous social gains of the Revolution while suppressing political liberty. He admired efficiency and strength and hated feudalism, religious intolerance, and civil inequality. Enlightened despotism meant political stability. He knew his Roman history well, as after 500 years of republicanism, Rome became an empire under [[Augustus Caesar]].

Although a supporter of the [[political radicalism|radical]] [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] during the early days of the Revolution (more out of pragmatism than any real ideology), Napoleon became increasingly autocratic as his political career progressed and once in power embraced certain aspects of both liberalism and authoritarianism – for example, [[public education]], a generally liberal restructuring of the French [[legal system]], and the emancipation of the Jews – while rejecting [[electoral democracy]] and [[freedom of the press]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[File:Calendrier-republicain-debucourt2.jpg|thumb|right|French Republican Calendar of 1794, drawn by [[Philibert-Louis Debucourt]]]]

The '''French Republican Calendar''' ({{lang-fr|calendrier républicain français}}), also commonly called the '''French Revolutionary Calendar''' (''calendrier révolutionnaire français''), was a [[calendar]] created and implemented during the [[French Revolution]], and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days by the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871. The revolutionary system was designed in part to remove all religious and royalist influences from the calendar, and was part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in France (which also included [[decimal time]] of day, [[decimalisation]] of currency, and [[metrication]]).

==Overview and origins==

===Precursor===
[[Sylvain Maréchal]], prominent anticlerical atheist, published the first edition of his ''Almanach des Honnêtes-gens'' (Almanac of Honest People) in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Almanach des Honnêtes-gens|pages=14&amp;ndash;15|first=Maréchal|last=Sylvain|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k48116c.swf.f3.langFR|publisher=Gallica|website=gallica.bnf.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On pages 14&amp;ndash;15 appears a calendar, consisting of twelve months. The first month is &quot;Mars, ou Princeps&quot; (March, or First), the last month is &quot;Février, ou Duodécembre&quot; (February, or Twelfth). (The months of September [meaning &quot;the seventh&quot;] through December [meaning &quot;the tenth&quot;] are already numeric names, although their meanings do not match their positions in either the Julian or the Gregorian calendar since the Romans changed the first month of a year from March to January.) The lengths of the months are the same; however, the 10th, 20th, and 30th are singled out of each month as the end of a ''décade'' (group of ten). Individual days were assigned, instead of to the traditional saints, to people noteworthy for mostly secular achievements; December 25 is assigned to both Jesus and Newton.

Later editions of the almanac would switch to the Republican Calendar.

===History===
[[File:Musee-historique-lausanne-img 0143.jpg|thumb|right|A copy of the French Republican Calendar  in the Historical Museum of Lausanne.]]
The days of the [[French Revolution]] and [[French First Republic|Republic]] saw many efforts to sweep away various trappings of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' (the old feudal monarchy); some of these were more successful than others. The new Republican government sought to institute, among other reforms, a new social and legal system, a new system of weights and measures (which became the [[metric system]]), and a new calendar. Amid nostalgia for the ancient [[Roman Republic]], the theories of [[the Enlightenment]] were at their peak, and the devisers of the new systems looked to nature for their inspiration. Natural constants, multiples of ten, and ''[[Latin]]'' as well as ''Old Greek'' derivations formed the fundamental blocks from which the new systems were built.

The new calendar was created by a commission under the direction of the politician [[Charles-Gilbert Romme]] seconded by [[Claude Joseph Ferry]] and [[Charles-François Dupuis]]. They associated with their work the chemist [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], the mathematician and astronomer [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], the astronomer [[Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande]], the mathematician [[Gaspard Monge]], the astronomer and naval geographer [[Alexandre Guy Pingré]], and the poet, actor and playwright [[Philippe François Nazaire Fabre d'Églantine|Fabre d'Églantine]], who invented the names of the months, with the help of [[André Thouin]], gardener at the [[Jardin des Plantes]] of the [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in Paris. As the [[rapporteur]] of the commission, Charles-Gilbert Romme presented the new calendar to the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]]-controlled [[National Convention]] on 23 September 1793, which adopted it on 24 October 1793 and also extended it [[wikt:proleptic|proleptically]] to its [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of 22 September 1792. It is because of his position as rapporteur of the commission that the creation of the republican calendar is attributed to Romme.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Guillaume]], ''Procès-verbaux du Comité d'instruction publique de la Convention nationale'', t. I, pp. 227–228 et t. II, pp. 440–448 ; Michel Froechlé, « Le calendrier républicain correspondait-il à une nécessité scientifique ? », Congrès national des sociétés savantes : scientifiques et sociétés, Paris, 1989, pp. 453–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calendar is often called the &quot;French Revolutionary Calendar&quot; because it was created during the Revolution, but this is somewhat of a misnomer. Indeed, there was initially a debate as to whether the calendar should celebrate the Great Revolution, which began in July 1789, or the Republic, which was established in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Le calendrier républicain: de sa création à sa disparition| date = 1994| publisher = Bureau des longitudes| isbn = 978-2-910015-09-1| page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following 14 July 1789, papers and pamphlets started calling 1789 year I of Liberty and the following years II and III. It was in 1792, with the practical problem of dating financial transactions, that the legislative assembly was confronted with the problem of the calendar. Originally, the choice of epoch was either 1 January 1789 or 14 July 1789. After some hesitation the assembly decided on 2 January 1792 that all official documents would use the &quot;era of Liberty&quot; and that the year IV of Liberty started on 1 January 1792. This usage was modified on 22 September 1792 when the Republic was proclaimed and the Convention decided that all public documents would be dated Year I of the French Republic. The decree of 2 January 1793 stipulated that the year II of the Republic began on 1 January 1793; this was revoked with the introduction of the new calendar, which set 22 September 1793 as the beginning of year II. The establishment of the Republic was used as the epochal date for the calendar; therefore, the calendar commemorates the Republic, not the Revolution. In France, it is known as the ''calendrier républicain'' as well as the ''calendrier révolutionnaire''.

The Revolution is usually considered to have ended with the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]] (the putsch of Napoléon Bonaparte against the established constitutional regime of the ''Directoire'') in Year VIII (9 November 1799). The French Republic ended with the [[coronation of Napoleon I]] as ''Empereur des Français'' (Emperor of the French) on 11 Frimaire, Year XIII (2 December 1804), a little more than a year before the calendar did.

The [[Concordat of 1801]] re-established the Roman Catholic Church as an official institution in France (though not as a state religion) with effect from Easter Sunday, 18 April 1802, restoring the names of the days of the week to the ones they had in the [[Gregorian Calendar]], while keeping the rest of the Republican Calendar, and fixing Sunday as the official day of rest and religious celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roi-president.com/bio/bio-fait-Concordat%20de%201801.html |title=Concordat de 1801 Napoleon Bonaparte religion en france Concordat de 1801 |publisher=Roi-president.com |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French coins of the period naturally used this calendar.  Many show the year (&quot;An&quot;) in Arabic numbers, although Roman numerals were used on some issues.  Year 11 coins typically have a &quot;XI&quot; date to avoid confusion with the Roman &quot;II&quot;.

[[Napoléon]] finally abolished the calendar with effect from 1 January 1806 (the day after 10 Nivôse an XIV), a little over twelve years after its introduction. However, it was used again during the brief [[Paris Commune]], 6–23 May 1871 (16 Floréal–3 Prairial An LXXIX).

Some legal texts that were adopted when the Republican Calendar was officially in use are still in force in France and other nations or territories which at the time were incorporated into revolutionary France, such as present-day Belgium, Luxembourg and the German territories to the west of the Rhine river. These documents have kept their original dates for legal accuracy and citation purposes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Calendar design===
[[File:French revolutionary date.JPG|thumb|L AN 2 DE LA REPUBLIQUE FR. (Year 2 of the French Republic) on a barn near Geneva]]
Years appear in writing as [[Roman numerals]] (usually), with epoch 22 September 1792, the beginning of the &quot;Republican Era&quot; (the day the [[French First Republic]] was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the monarchy). As a result, Roman Numeral I indicates the first year of the republic, that is, the year before the calendar actually came into use. By law, the beginning of each year was set at midnight, beginning on the day the apparent [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] falls at the Paris Observatory.

There were twelve months, each divided into three ten-day weeks called ''décades''. The tenth day, ''décadi'', replaced Sunday as the day of rest and festivity. The five or six extra days needed to approximate the solar or [[tropical year]] were placed after the months at the end of each year and called [[Sansculottides|complementary days]]. This arrangement was an almost exact copy of the calendar used by the Ancient Egyptians, though in their case the beginning of the year was marked by summer solstice rather than autumn equinox.

A period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a &quot;Franciade&quot;. The name &quot;[[Olympiad|Olympique]]&quot; was originally proposed&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapportsur&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Le calendrier républicain: de sa création à sa disparition| date = 1994| publisher = Bureau des longitudes| isbn = 978-2-910015-09-1| page = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but changed to Franciade to commemorate the fact that it had taken the revolution four years to establish a republican government in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Le calendrier républicain: de sa création à sa disparition| date = 1994| publisher = Bureau des longitudes| isbn = 978-2-910015-09-1| page = 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leap year was called ''Sextile'', an allusion to the &quot;[[bissextus|bissextile]]&quot; [[leap year]]s of the Julian and Gregorian calendars, because it contained a sixth complementary day.

===Decimal time===
{{Main|Decimal time}}
Each day in the Republican Calendar was divided into ten hours, each hour into 100 decimal minutes, and each decimal minute into 100 decimal seconds. Thus an hour was 144 conventional minutes (more than twice as long as a conventional hour), a minute was 86.4 conventional seconds (44% longer than a conventional minute), and a second was 0.864 conventional seconds (13.6% shorter than a conventional second).

[[Clock]]s were manufactured to display this [[decimal time]], but it did not catch on. Mandatory use of decimal time was officially suspended 7 April 1795, although some cities continued to use decimal time as late as 1801.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrigan&quot;&gt;Richard A. Carrigan, Jr. &quot;Decimal Time&quot;. ''[[American Scientist]]'', (May–June 1978), '''66(3)''': 305–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbering of years in the Republican Calendar by [[Roman numerals]] ran counter to this general decimalization tendency.

== Months ==
The Republican calendar year began the day the [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] occurred in Paris, and had twelve months of 30 days each, which were given new names based on nature, principally having to do with the prevailing weather in and around Paris.
* Autumn:
** [[Vendémiaire]] in French (from French ''vendange'', derived from Latin ''vindemia'', &quot;grape harvest&quot;), starting 22, 23, or 24 September
** [[Brumaire]] (from French ''brume'', &quot;mist&quot;), starting 22, 23, or 24 October
** [[Frimaire]] (From French ''frimas'', &quot;frost&quot;), starting 21, 22, or 23 November
* Winter:
** [[Nivôse]] (from Latin ''nivosus'', &quot;snowy&quot;), starting 21, 22, or 23 December
** [[Pluviôse]] (from French ''pluvieux'', derived from Latin ''pluvius'', &quot;rainy&quot;), starting 20, 21, or 22 January
** [[Ventôse]] (from French ''venteux'', derived from Latin ''ventosus'', &quot;windy&quot;), starting 19, 20, or 21 February
* Spring:
** [[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|Germinal]] (from French ''germination''), starting 20 or 21 March
** [[Floréal]] (from French ''fleur'', derived from Latin ''flos'', &quot;flower&quot;), starting 20 or 21 April
** [[Prairial]] (from French ''prairie'', &quot;meadow&quot;), starting 20 or 21 May
* Summer:
** [[Messidor]] (from Latin ''messis'', &quot;harvest&quot;), starting 19 or 20 June
** [[Thermidor]] (or Fervidor) (from Greek ''thermon'', &quot;summer heat&quot;), starting 19 or 20 July
** [[Fructidor]] (from Latin ''fructus'', &quot;fruit&quot;), starting 18 or 19 August

Note: On many printed calendars of Year II (1793–94), the month of ''Thermidor'' was named ''Fervidor'' (from Latin ''fervens'', &quot;hot&quot;).

Most of the month names were new words coined from French, [[Latin]], or [[Greek language|Greek]]. The endings of the names are grouped by season. &quot;Dor&quot; means &quot;giving&quot; in Greek.&lt;ref name=Carlyle /&gt;

In Britain, a contemporary wit mocked the Republican Calendar by calling the months: Wheezy, Sneezy and Freezy; Slippy, Drippy and Nippy; Showery, Flowery and Bowery; Hoppy, Croppy and Poppy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E6EaAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;ots=XSX9c3ZOSC&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20Calendar%22&amp;f=false |title=Sporting Magazine|volume=15|page=210|date=January 1800|publisher=Rogerson and Tuxford|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scotland|Scottish]] historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] suggested somewhat more serious English names in his 1837 work ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'',&lt;ref name = &quot;Carlyle&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Thomas Carlyle| title = The French revolution: a history| url = https://books.google.com/?id=81sQAAAAYAAJ| date = 1867| publisher = Harper| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; namely Vintagearious, Fogarious, Frostarious, Snowous, Rainous, Windous, Buddal, Floweral, Meadowal, Reapidor, Heatidor, and Fruitidor. Like the French originals, they are [[neologism]]s suggesting a meaning related to the season.

==Ten days of the week==
[[File:Montre revolutionnaire-IMG 4629-black.jpg|thumb|French Revolutionary pocket watch showing ten-day ''décade'' names and thirty-day month numbers from the Republican Calendar, but with duodecimal time. On display at Neuchâtel Beaux-Arts museum.]]
The month is divided into three ''décades'' or 'weeks' of ten days each, named simply:
* ''primidi'' (first day)
* ''duodi'' (second day)
* ''tridi'' (third day)
* ''quartidi'' (fourth day)
* ''quintidi'' (fifth day)
* ''sextidi'' (sixth day)
* ''septidi'' (seventh day)
* ''octidi'' (eighth day)
* ''nonidi'' (ninth day)
* ''décadi'' (tenth day)

Décades were abandoned in Floréal an X (April 1802).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Antoine Augustin Renouard| title = Manuel pour la concordance des calendriers républicain et grégorien| url = https://books.google.com/?id=oUoMAAAAIAAJ| accessdate = 14 September 2009| edition = 2| date = 1822| publisher = A. A. Renouard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural Calendar==
The [[Catholic Church]] used a [[calendar of saints]], which named each day of the year after an associated [[saint]]. To reduce the influence of the Church, [[Fabre d'Églantine]] introduced a Rural Calendar in which each day of the year had a unique name associated with the rural economy, stated to correspond to the time of year. Every ''décadi'' (ending in 0) was named after an agricultural tool. Each ''quintidi'' (ending in 5) was named for a common animal. The rest of the days were named for &quot;grain, pasture, trees, roots, flowers, fruits&quot; and other plants, except for the first month of winter, Nivôse, during which the rest of the days were named after minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ed.

{{quote|Our starting point was the idea of celebrating, through the calendar, the agricultural system, and of leading the nation back to it, marking the times and the fractions of the year by intelligible or visible signs taken from agriculture and the rural economy. (...)

As the calendar is something that we use so often, we must take advantage of this frequency of use to put elementary notions of agriculture before the people &amp;mdash; to show the richness of nature, to make them love the fields, and to methodically show them the order of the influences of the heavens and of the products of the earth.

The priests assigned the commemoration of a so-called saint to each day of the year: this catalogue exhibited neither utility nor method; it was a collection of lies, of deceit or of charlatanism.

We thought that the nation, after having kicked out this canonised mob from its calendar, must replace it with the objects that make up the true riches of the nation, worthy objects not from a cult, but from agriculture &amp;mdash; useful products of the soil, the tools that we use to cultivate it, and the domesticated animals, our faithful servants in these works; animals much more precious, without doubt, to the eye of reason, than the beatified skeletons pulled from the catacombs of Rome.

So we have arranged in the column of each month, the names of the real treasures of the rural economy.  The grains, the pastures, the trees, the roots, the flowers, the fruits, the plants are arranged in the calendar, in such a way that the place and the day of the month that each product occupies is precisely the season and the day that Nature presents it to us.

==Complementary days==
{{Main|Sansculottides}}
Five extra days – six in [[leap year]]s – were national holidays at the end of every year. These were originally known as ''les sans-culottides'' (after ''[[sans-culottes]]''), but after year III (1795) as ''les jours complémentaires'':
* 1st complementary day: [[La Fête de la Vertu]], &quot;Celebration of Virtue&quot;, on 17 or 18 September
* 2nd complementary day: [[La Fête du Génie]], &quot;Celebration of Talent&quot;, on 18 or 19 September
* 3rd complementary day: [[La Fête du Travail]], &quot;Celebration of Labour&quot;, on 19 or 20 September
* 4th complementary day: [[La Fête de l'Opinion]], &quot;Celebration of Convictions&quot;, on 20 or 21 September
* 5th complementary day: [[La Fête des Récompenses]], &quot;Celebration of Honors (Awards)&quot;, on 21 or 22 September
* 6th complementary day: [[La Fête de la Révolution]], &quot;Celebration of the Revolution&quot;, on 22 or 23 September (on leap years only)

The calendar was abolished in the year XIV (1805). After this date, opinions seem to differ on the method by which the leap years would have been determined if the calendar were still in force. There are at least four hypotheses used to convert dates from the Gregorian calendar:
* ''Equinox:'' The leap years would continue to vary in order to ensure that each year the autumnal equinox in Paris falls on 1 Vendémiaire, as was the case from year I to year XIV. This is the only method that was ever in legal effect, although it means that sometimes five years pass between leap years, such as the years 15 and 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| title = Concordance de l'Annuaire de la République française avec le calendrier grégorien
| author=Sébastien Louis Rosaz
| date = 1810
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Romme:'' Leap years would have fallen on each year divisible by four (thus in 20, 24, 28…), except most century years, according to Romme's proposed fixed rules. This would have simplified conversions between the Republican and Gregorian calendars since the Republican leap day would usually follow a few months after 29 February, at the end of each year divisible by four, so that the date of the Republican New Year remains the same (22 September) in the Gregorian calendar for the entire third century of the Republican Era (AD 1992–2091).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prairial.free.fr/calendrier/calendrier.php?lien=discoursromme |title=Brumaire – Calendrier Républicain |publisher=Prairial.free.fr |accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Continuous:'' The leap years would have continued in a fixed rule every four years from the last one (thus years 15, 19, 23, 27…) with the leap day added before, rather than after, each year divisible by four, except most century years. This rule has the advantage that it is both simple to calculate and is continuous with every year in which the calendar was in official use during the [[French First Republic|First Republic]]. Some concordances were printed in France, after the Republican Calendar was abandoned, using this rule to determine dates for long-term contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Antoine Augustin Renouard| title = Manuel pour la concordance des calendriers républicain et grégorien: ou, Recueil complet de tous les annuaires depuis la première année républicaine| url = https://books.google.com/?id=oUoMAAAAIAAJ| edition = 2| date = 1822| publisher = A.

* ''128-Year:'' Beginning with year 20, years divisible by four would be leap years, except for years divisible by 128. Note that this rule was first proposed by [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler|von Mädler]], and not until the late 19th century. The date of the Republican New Year remains the same (23 September) in the Gregorian calendar every year from 129 to 256 (AD 1920–2047).&lt;ref&gt;[http://personal.telefonica.terra.es/web/jlmartinmas/repcalendar/calendar.html The French Revolution Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectpluto.com/calendar.htm#republican |title=Calendars |publisher=Projectpluto.com |accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webexhibits.org/calendars/calendar-french.html |title=The French Revolutionary Calendar , Calendars |publisher=Webexhibits.org |accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and shortcomings ==
[[File:Horloge-republicaine1.jpg|thumb|Clock dial displaying both decimal and duodecimal time.]]
[[Leap years]] in the calendar are a point of great dispute, due to the contradicting statements in the establishing decree&lt;ref name=&quot;gefrance.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gefrance.com/calrep/decrets.htm |title=Le Calendrier Republicain |publisher=Gefrance.com |accessdate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating:
{{quote|Each year begins at midnight, with the day on which the true autumnal equinox falls for the [[Paris Observatory]].}}
and:
{{quote|The four-year period, after which the addition of a day is usually necessary, is called the ''Franciade'' in memory of the revolution which, after four years of effort, led France to republican government. The fourth year of the ''Franciade'' is called ''Sextile''.}}

These two specifications are incompatible, as leap years defined by the autumnal equinox in Paris do not recur on a regular four year schedule. Thus, the years III, VII, and XI were observed as leap years, and the years XV and XX were also planned as such, even though they were five years apart.
[[File:Horloge-republicaine2.jpg|thumb|Clock dial displaying both decimal (inside the circle) and duodecimal time (on the outer rim).]]

A fixed arithmetic rule for determining leap years was proposed in the name of the Committee of Public Education by [[Gilbert Romme]] on 19&amp;nbsp;Floréal&amp;nbsp;An&amp;nbsp;III (8 May 1795). The proposed rule was to determine leap years by applying the rules of the Gregorian calendar to the years of the French Republic (years IV, VIII, XII, etc. were to be leap years) except that year 4000 (the last year of ten 400-year periods) should be a common year instead of a leap year. Because he was shortly after sentenced to the guillotine, this proposal was never adopted and the original astronomical rule continued, which excluded any other fixed arithmetic rule. The proposal was intended to avoid uncertain future leap years caused by the inaccurate astronomical knowledge of the 1790s (even today, this statement is still valid due to the uncertainty in [[ΔT]]). In particular, the committee noted that the autumnal equinox of year 144 was predicted to occur at 11:59:40&amp;nbsp;pm [[local apparent time]] in Paris, which was closer to midnight than its inherent 3 to 4&amp;nbsp;minute uncertainty.

The calendar was abolished by an act dated 22 Fructidor an XIII (9 September 1805) and signed by [[Napoleon]], which referred to a report by [[Michel-Louis-Étienne Regnaud de Saint-Jean d'Angély]] and [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], listing two fundamental flaws.
# The rule for leap years depended upon the uneven course of the sun, rather than fixed intervals, so that one must consult astronomers to determine when each year started, especially when the equinox happened close to midnight, as the exact moment could not be predicted with certainty. 
# Both the era and the beginning of the year were chosen to commemorate an historical event which occurred on the first day of autumn in France, whereas the other European nations began the year near the beginning of winter or spring, thus being impediments to the calendar's adoption in Europe and America, and even a part of the French nation, where the Gregorian calendar continued to be used, as it was required for religious purposes.
The report also noted that the 10-day décade was unpopular and had already been suppressed three years earlier in favor of the 7-day week, removing what was considered by some as one of the calendar's main benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Antoine Augustin Renouard| title = Manuel pour la concordance des calendriers républicain et grégorien: ou, Recueil complet de tous les annuaires depuis la première année républicaine| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oUoMAAAAIAAJ| edition = 2| date = 1822| publisher = A. A. Renouard | page = 217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10-day décade was unpopular with laborers because they received only one full day of rest out of ten, instead of one in seven, although they also got a half-day off on the fifth day. It also, by design, conflicted with Sunday religious observances.

Another criticism of the calendar was that despite the poetic names of its months, they are tied to the climate and agriculture of [[metropolitan France]] and therefore not applicable to [[Overseas departments and territories of France|France's overseas territories]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Famous dates and other cultural references==
{{See also|Glossary of the French Revolution#Events commonly known by their Revolutionary dates}}
[[File:Ecole normale supérieure 2.JPG|thumb|''Décret de la Convention 9 Brumaire An III'' above the entrance to the [[École Normale Supérieure|ENS]].]]
The &quot;[[18 Brumaire]]&quot; or &quot;Brumaire&quot; was the [[coup d'état]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] on 18 Brumaire An VIII (9 November 1799), which many historians consider as the end of the French Revolution. [[Karl Marx]]' 1852 essay ''[[The 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoléon]]'' compares [[French coup of 1851|the 1851 coup]] of [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoléon]] to his uncle's earlier coup.

Another famous revolutionary date is [[Thermidorian Reaction|9 Thermidor An II]] (27 July 1794), the date the Convention turned against [[Robespierre]], who, along with others associated with [[the Mountain]], was [[guillotine]]d the following day. Based on this event, the term &quot;Thermidorian&quot; entered the [[Marxist]] vocabulary as referring to revolutionaries who destroy the revolution from the inside and turn against its true aims. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers used this term about [[Joseph Stalin]].

[[Émile Zola]]'s novel ''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'' takes its name from the calendar's month of Germinal.

The seafood dish [[lobster thermidor]] was probably named after the 1891 play ''[[Thermidor (play)|Thermidor]]'', set during the Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;James2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = James| first = Kenneth| title = Escoffier: The King of Chefs| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JFIDd639wlQC&amp;pg=PA44| accessdate = 11 March 2012| date = 15 November 2006| publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group| isbn = 978-1-85285-526-0| page = 44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lobster%20thermidor|title=Lobster thermidor|work=Online Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French frigates of the [[Floréal class frigate|''Floréal'' class]] all bear names of Republican months.

The Convention of 9 Brumaire An III, 30 October 1794, established the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. The date appears prominently on the entrance to the school.

The French composer [[Fromental Halévy]] was named after the feast day of 'Fromental' in the Revolutionary Calendar, which occurred on his birthday in year VIII (27 May 1799).

[[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' series, included a story called Thermidor which takes place on that month during the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandman&quot;&gt;{{cite comic | writer=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | penciller=[[Stan Woch|Woch, Stan]] | inker=[[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Nick]] | colorist=[[Daniel Vozzo|Vozzo, Daniel]] | letterer=[[Todd Klein|Klein, Todd]] | editor = [[Karen Berger|Berger, Karen]] | story=Thermidor | title=[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]] | volume=29 | date=August 1991 | publisher=[[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Liavek]]'' shared world series uses a calendar which is a direct translation of the French Republican calendar.

[[Sarah Monette]]'s ''[[Doctrine of Labyrinths]]'' series borrows the Republican calendar for one of the two competing calendars (their usage splits between social classes) in the fictional city of Mélusine.

A '''Jacobin''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒakɔbɛ̃}}) was a member of the [[Jacobin Club]], a revolutionary political movement that was the most famous political club during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt. Marxism and the ''French Left: Studies on Labour and Politics in France, 1830–1981''. New York, New York, USA; London, England, UK: New York University Press, 2011. Pp. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The club was so called from the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] convent where they originally met, in the [[Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris|Rue Saint-Jacques]] (Latin: ''Jacobus'') in Paris.

Today, '''''Jacobin'''''  and '''''Jacobinism''''' are used in a variety of senses. ''Jacobin'' is sometimes used in Britain as a pejorative for [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]], [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] revolutionary politics ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|dʒ|æ|k|ə|b|ᵻ|n}}), especially when it exhibits dogmatism and violent repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Brockden Brown|author2=Philip Barnard, ed.|author3=Stephen Shapiro, ed.|title=Charles Brockden Brown's Wieland, Ormond, Arthur Mervyn, and Edgar Huntly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6otAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360|year=2009|publisher=Hackett Publishing|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, ''Jacobin'' now generally indicates a supporter of a centralized republican state and strong central government powers&lt;ref&gt;Alain Rey, Dictionnaire historique de la langue française, Le Robert, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or supporters of extensive government intervention to transform society.

==Jacobins in the French Revolution==

The Jacobin Club was one of several organizations that grew out of the French Revolution, and it was distinguished for its left-wing, revolutionary politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudé&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudé |first=George |authorlink=George Rudé |date=1988 |title=The French Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the Jacobins, unlike other sects like the [[Girondins]], were closely allied to the [[sans-culottes]], who were a popular force of working-class Parisians that played a pivotal role in the development of the revolution. The Jacobins had a significant presence in the National Convention, and were dubbed 'the Mountain' for their seats in the uppermost part of the chamber. Eventually, the Revolution coalesced around the Mountain's power, with the help of the insurrections of the sans-culottes, and, led by [[Robespierre]], the Jacobins established a revolutionary dictatorship, or the joint domination of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and [[Committee of General Security]]. The Jacobin dictatorship was known for enacting the [[Reign of Terror]], which targeted speculators, [[monarchists]], right-wing agitators, [[Hébertists]], and traitors, and led to many beheadings.

The Jacobins were known for creating a strong government that could deal with the needs of war, economic chaos, and internal rebellion (such as the [[War in the Vendée]]). The Jacobins supported the rights of property, but represented a much more middle-class position than the government which succeeded them in [[Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidor]]. Their economic policy established the [[General maximum]], in order to control prices and create stability both for the workers and poor and the revolution. They favored free trade and a liberal economy much like the Girondists, but their relationship to the people made them more willing to adapt interventionist economic policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudé&quot;/&gt;{{rp|81–82}}

==United Kingdom==
In England, the word was also popularized in [[George Canning]]'s paper, ''The [[Anti-Jacobin]]'', which criticized the English [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]]s, of the 18th and 19th centuries.

The English who supported the French Revolution during its early stages (or even throughout) were early known as ''Jacobins''. These included the young [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Wordsworth]], and others prior to their disillusionment with the outbreak of the [[Reign of Terror]]. Others, such as [[William Hazlitt]] and [[Thomas Paine]], remained idealistic about the Revolution. Much detail on English Jacobinism can be found in [[E.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Thompson]]'s ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]''. Welsh Jacobins include [[William Jones (Welsh radical)|William Jones]], a radical patriot who was a keen disciple of [[Voltaire]]. Rather than preaching revolution, Jones believed that an exodus from Wales was required and that a new Welsh colony should be founded in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff|page=434 |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austria==
In the correspondence of [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Metternich]] and other leaders of the repressive policies that followed the second fall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1815, ''Jacobin'' is the term commonly applied to anyone with [[liberalism|liberal]] tendencies, such as the emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]].

==United States==
Early [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]-leaning American newspapers during the French Revolution referred to the [[Democratic-Republican]] party as the &quot;Jacobin Party&quot;. The most notable examples are the ''[[Gazette of the United States]]'', published in Philadelphia, and the ''[[Delaware and Eastern Shore Advertiser]]'', published in Wilmington, during the elections of 1798.

In modern American politics, the term Jacobin is often used to describe extremists of any party who demand ideological purity. For instance, in the lead-up to the [[1964&amp;nbsp;Republican National Convention]], the press referred to supporters of the insurgent [[Arizona]] conservative [[Barry Goldwater]] as &quot;Cactus Jacobins&quot; in their effort to unseat the moderate [[Eastern United States|East Coast]] branch of the party (see [[Rockefeller Republican]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;donaldson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Gary|title=Liberalism's Last Hurrah: The Presidential Campaign of 1964|year=2003|publisher=Sharpe|isbn=0765611198|pages=174|location=Armonk, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Brent Bozell, Jr.]] has written in Goldwater's seminal ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'' (1960) that &quot;Throughout history, [[No true Scotsman|true Conservatism]] has been at war equally with autocrats and with 'democratic' Jacobins.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;goldwater&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldwater|first=Barry M.|title=The Conscience of a Conservative|location=Shepherdsville, KY|publisher=Victor Publishing Company|year=1960|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a radical American publication, ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'', was founded.

===Tea Party===
The term was employed, in 2008–2010, and started as a movement for presidential hopeful Ron Paul before being taken over by mainstream conservatives. For example, Eve Fairbanks described right-wing opponents of moderate Republican Congressman [[Wayne Gilchrest]] as &quot;Jacobin conservatives&quot; in ''[[The New Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eve |last=Fairbanks |title=Unsafe At Any District |url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=56a3ea96-037a-45a3-9885-4558580577f9 |work=[[The New Republic]] |publisher=[[Canwest]] |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 27 May 2010, issue of ''The New York Review of Books'', [[Columbia University|Columbia]] professor Mark Lilla analyzed five recent books dealing with American political party discontent in a review titled, &quot;The Tea Party Jacobins&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Tea Party Jacobins&quot;, Mark Lilla, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 27 May 2010, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegorical usage==
The conventionalized scrawny, French revolutionary ''[[sans-culottes]]'' Jacobin, was developed from about 1790 by British [[satire|satirical]] artists [[James Gillray]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank]]. It was commonly contrasted with the stolid stocky conservative and well-meaning [[John Bull]], dressed like an English country squire. [[C.&amp;nbsp;L.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;James]] also used the term to refer to revolutionaries during the [[Haitian Revolution]] in his book ''[[The Black Jacobins]]''.

The '''French Revolutionary Army''' ({{lang-fr|Armée révolutionnaire française}}) was the French force that fought the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] from 1792 to 1802. These armies were characterised by their revolutionary fervour, their poor equipment and their great numbers. Although they experienced early disastrous defeats, the revolutionary armies successfully expelled foreign forces from French soil and then overran many neighboring countries, establishing [[French client republic|client republics]]. Leading generals included [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Bonaparte]], [[André Masséna|Masséna]] and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]].

==Formation==
[[File:Fusilier Révolution française.jpg|250px|thumb|French line fusilier during the Revolution]]

As the ''ancien regime'' gave way to a constitutional monarchy, and then to a republic, 1789–92, the entire structure of France was transformed to fall into line with the Revolutionary principles of &quot;[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality and Fraternity]]&quot;.  Reactionary Europe stood opposed, especially after the French king was executed. The signing of the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] between [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] and the subsequent French declaration of war meant that from its formation, the Republic of France was at war, and it required a potent military force to ensure its survival. As a result, one of the first major elements of the French state to be restructured was the army.

Almost all of the ''ancien regime'' officer class had been drawn from the aristocracy. During the period preceding the final overthrow of the Monarchy, large numbers of officers left their regiments and emigrated. Between 15 September and 1 December 1791 alone 2,160 officers of the royal army fled France&lt;ref&gt;Munro Price, &quot;The Fall of the French Monarchy&quot;, ISBN 0-330-48827-9&lt;/ref&gt; eventually to join the ''[[émigré]]'' army of [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé]]. Of those who stayed numbers were either imprisoned or killed during the [[Reign of Terror]]. The small remaining cadre of officers were promoted swiftly; this meant that the majority of the Revolutionary officers were far younger than their Monarchist counterparts. Those high-ranking aristocratic officers who remained, among them [[Marquis de la Fayette]], [[Comte de Rochambeau]] and [[Nicolas Luckner|Comte Nicolas Luckner]], were soon accused of having monarchist sympathies and either executed or forced into exile.

Revolutionary fervour, along with calls to save the new regime, resulted in a large influx of enthusiastic yet untrained and undisciplined volunteers (the first ''[[sans-culottes]]'', so called because they wore peasants trousers rather than the [[knee-breeches]] used by the other armies of the time). The desperate situation meant that these men were quickly inducted into the army. One reason for the success of the French Revolutionary Army is the &quot;amalgamation&quot; (''amalgame'') organized by the military strategist [[Lazare Carnot]], later [[Napoleon]]'s [[Minister of War]], who assembled in the same [[Demi-brigade|regiment]], but in different battalions, young volunteers full of enthusiasm at the thought of dying for liberty and old veterans from the [[French Royal Army (1652–1830)|former royal army]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napoleonguide.com/carnot.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napoleon-series.org/ins/weider/c_peace.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The transformation of the Army was best seen in the officer corps.  Before the revolution 90% had been aristocrats, compared to only 3% in 1794.  Revolutionary fervor was high, and was closely monitored by the Committee of Public Safety, which assigned Representatives on Mission to keep watch on the general.  Indeed, some generals deserted, others were removed or executed.  The government demanded that soldiers be loyal to the government in Paris, not to their generals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Doughty and Ira Gruber, ed. ''Warfare in the Western World: volume 1: Military operations from 1600 to 1871'' (1996) p 187&lt;/ref&gt;

==''1791 Reglement''==

Officially, the Revolutionary Armies were operating along the guidelines set down in the ''1791 Reglement'', a set of regulations created during the years before the Revolution. The ''1791 Reglement'' laid down several complex tactical maneuvers, maneuvers which demanded well trained [[soldier]]s, [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s to perform correctly. The Revolutionary Army was lacking in all three of these areas, and as a result the early efforts to conform to the ''1791 Reglement'' were met with disaster. The untrained troops could not perform the complex maneuvers required, unit cohesion was lost and defeat was ensured.

Realizing that the army was not capable of conforming with the ''1791 Reglement'', commanders began experimenting with formations which required less training to perform. Many eminent French military thinkers had been clamoring for change decades before. In the period following the humiliating performance of the French Army during the [[Seven Years' War]], they began to experiment with new ideas. [[Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert|Guibert]] wrote his epic ''Essai général de Tactique'', [[Pierre-Joseph Bourcet|Bourcet]] focused on staff procedures and [[mountain warfare]], and [[Baron le Mesnil-Durand|Mesnil-Durand]] spent his time advocating ''[[l'ordre profond]]'', tactics of maneuvering and fighting in heavy [[tactical column|columnar formations]], placing emphasis on the shock of [[bayonet|cold steel]] over firepower.

In the 1770s, some commanders, among them the brilliant [[Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie|duc de Broglie]] performed exercises testing these tactics. It was finally decided to launch a series of experiments to try out the new tactics, and comparing them to the standard [[Frederick the Great|Fredrickian]] linear formation known as ''[[l'ordre mince]]'' which was universally popular throughout [[Europe]]. De Broglie decided that ''l'ordre profond'' worked best when it was supported by artillery and large numbers of skirmishers. Despite these exercises, ''l'ordre mince'' had strong and powerful supporters in the Royal [[Armée Française]], and it was this formation which went into the ''1791 Reglement'' as the standard.

==Trial by fire==
[[File:Valmy Battle painting.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[battle of Valmy]] (1792).]]
The French struck first, with an invasion of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] proposed by foreign minister [[Charles François Dumouriez]]. This invasion soon turned into a debacle when it was found that the hastily trained Revolutionary forces badly lacked obedience: on one occasion, troops murdered their general to avoid a battle; on another, troops insisted on putting their commander's orders to a vote. The Revolutionary forces retreated from the Austrian Netherlands in disarray.

In August 1792, a large Austro-Prussian army commanded by the [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg|Duke of Brunswick]] crossed the frontier and began its march on Paris with the declared intention of restoring full power to Louis XVI. Several Revolutionary armies were easily defeated by the professional Austrian, [[Hesse|Hessian]], [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] and [[Prussia]]n troops. The immediate result of this was the [[10th of August (French Revolution)|storming]] of the [[Tuileries Palace]] and the overthrow of the king. Successive Revolutionary forces failed to halt Brunswick's advance, and by mid-September it appeared that Paris would fall to the monarchists. The [[National Convention|Convention]] ordered the remaining armies to be combined under the command of Dumouriez and [[François Christophe Kellermann]]. At the [[Battle of Valmy]] on 20 September 1792, the Revolutionary forces defeated Brunswick's advance guard, causing the invading army to begin retreating to the border. Much of the credit to the victory must go to the French [[artillery]], widely viewed as the best in Europe thanks to the technical improvements of [[Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]].

The Battle of Valmy ensured that the Revolutionary armies were respected by their enemies, and for the next ten years they not only defended the fledgling [[First French Republic]], but under the command of Generals such as [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]], [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]], [[Jean Baptiste Kléber|Kléber]], [[Louis Charles Antoine Desaix de Veygoux|Desaix]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] expanded the borders of the French republic.

==Lazare Carnot==
While the ''Cannonade of Valmy'' had saved the Republic from imminent destruction and caused its enemies to take pause, the [[Louis XVI of France#The imprisonment and execution of Louis.2C 1792 - 1793|guillotining of Louis XVI]] in January 1793 and the convention's proclamation that it would '[[export the revolution]]' hardened the resolve of France's enemies to destroy the Republic and reinstate a monarchy.

In early 1793, the [[First Coalition]] was formed, not only from Prussia and Austria, but also [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], The Dutch United Provinces, Spain and Great Britain. The Republic was under attack on several fronts, and in the fiercely Catholic region of [[La Vendée]] an armed [[Revolt in the Vendée|revolt]] had broken out. 
The Revolutionary army was greatly overstretched, and it seemed that the fall of the republic was imminent.

In early 1793 [[Lazare Carnot]], a prominent [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], and delegate to the Convention, was promoted to the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. Displaying an exceptional talent for organization and for enforcing discipline, Carnot set about rearranging the disheveled Revolutionary Armies. Realizing that no amount of reforming and discipline was going to offset the massive numerical superiority enjoyed by France's enemies, Carnot ordered (24 February 1793 decree of the national Convention) each département to provide a quota of new recruits, a number totaling around 300,000. By mid-1793, the Revolutionary Army had increased around 645,000 men.

==''Levée en masse''==
On 23 August 1793, at Carnot's insistence, the Convention issued the following proclamation ordering a ''[[levée en masse]]''
:&quot;From this moment until such time as its enemies shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the armies. The young men shall fight; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn linen into lint; the old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, C.D. - ''The French Revolution'' Vol II, pp 666&lt;/ref&gt;

All unmarried able bodied men aged between 18 and 25 were to report immediately for military service. Those married, as well as the remaining men, women and children, were to focus their efforts on arming and supplying the army.

This increased the size of the Revolutionary Armies dramatically, providing the armies in the field with the manpower to hold off the enemy attacks. Carnot was hailed by the government as the ''Organizer of Victory''. By September 1794, the Revolutionary Army had 1,500,000 men under arms. Carnot's ''levée en masse'' had provided so much manpower that it was not necessary to repeat it again until 1797.

==Tactics==
[[File:General, Officer d'Legere, Soldat d'Ligne.jpg|thumb|right|French Revolutionary ''général'', ''officer d'infanterie legere'' and soldier of a ''demi-brigade de ligne''.]]

Seeing the failure of the ''1791 Reglement'', several early revolutionary commanders followed de Broglie's example and experimented with the pre-revolutionary ideas, gradually adapting them until they discovered a system that worked. The final standard used by the early Revolutionary Armies consisted of the following.

* Troops with exceptional morale or skill became [[skirmishers]], and were deployed in a screen in front of the Army. Their main fighting tactics were of a guerrilla-warfare nature. Both mounted and on foot, the large swarm of skirmishers would hide from enemies if possible, pepper their formations with fire and deploy ambushes. Unable to retaliate on the scattered skirmishers, the morale and unit cohesion of the better trained and equipped émigré and monarchist armies was gradually worn down. The incessant harassing fire usually resulted in a section of the enemy line wavering, and then the 'regular' formations of the Revolutionary Army would be sent into the attack.
* Troops with less skill and of more dubious quality, making up the 'regular' part of the army, were formed into [[battalion column]]s. The battalion column required little training to perfect, and provided commanders with potent &quot;battering ram-style&quot; formations with which to hit the enemy lines after the skirmishers had done their work. The skirmish screen also provided protection for those troops

==Infantry==
[[File:Soldats Révolution française.jpg|thumb|right|French Republican soldiers]]
Following the dissolution of the ''ancien regime'', the system of named regiments was abandoned. Instead, the new army was formed into a series of numbered ''demi-brigades''. Consisting of two or three [[battalion]]s, these formations were designated ''[[demi-brigade]]s'' in an attempt to avoid the feudal connotations of the term ''Regiment''. In mid-1793, the Revolutionary Army officially comprised 196 infantry ''demi-brigades''.

After the initial dismal performance of the ''federe'' volunteer battalions, Carnot ordered that each ''demi-brigade'' was to consist of one regular (ex-Royal Army) and two ''federe'' battalions. These new formations, intended to combine the discipline and training of the old army with the enthusiasm of the new volunteers,&lt;ref&gt;Terry Crowdy, pages 18-19, &quot;French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802&quot;, ISBN 1-84176-660-7&lt;/ref&gt; were proven successful at [[Valmy]] in September 1792. In 1794, the new ''demi-brigade'' was universally adopted.

[[File:EgyptFrInf2Lg.jpg|thumb|right|French soldiers from the 1798–1801 Egyptian campaign (left to right, clockwise): line infantry officer, line infantryman, line drummer, light infantryman.]]

The Revolutionary Army had been formed from a hodgepodge of different units, and as such did not have a uniform appearance. Veterans in their white uniforms and [[tarleton helmet]]s from the ''ancien regime'' period served alongside national guardsmen in their blue jackets with white turnbacks piped red and ''federes'' dressed in civilian clothes with only the red [[Phrygian cap#Revolutionary icon|phrygian cap]] and the tricolour [[cockade]] to identify them as soldiers. Poor supplies meant that uniforms which had worn out were replaced with civilian clothes, and so the Revolutionary Army lacked any semblance of uniformity, with the exception of the tricolour cockade which was worn by all soldiers. As the war progressed, several ''demi-brigades'' were issued specific coloured uniform jackets, and the Revolutionary [[Armée d'Orient (1798)|''Armée d'Orient'']] which arrived in [[Egypt]] in 1798 was uniformed in purple, pink, green, red, orange and blue jackets.

Along with the problem of uniforms, many men of the Revolutionary Army lacked weapons and ammunition. Any weapons captured from the enemy were immediately absorbed into the ranks. After the [[Battle of Montenotte]] in 1796, 1,000 French soldiers who had been sent into battle unarmed were afterwards equipped with captured Austrian muskets. As a result, uniformity was also lacking in weapons.

Besides the regular ''demi-brigades'', [[light infantry]] ''demi-brigades'' also existed. These formations were formed from soldiers who had shown skill in marksmanship, and were used for skirmishing in front of the main force. As with the line ''demi-brigades'', the light ''demi-brigades'' lacked uniformity in either weapons or equipment.

==Artillery==
Supporting the skirmishers was the French [[artillery]]. The artillery had suffered least from the exodus of aristocratic officers during the early days of the Revolution, as it was commanded mostly by men drawn from the middle class. The man who would shape the era, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], himself was an artilleryman. The various technical improvements of Général [[Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]] in the years preceding the Revolution, and the subsequent efforts of [[Baron Jean-Pierre du Teil|Baron du Teil]] and his brother [[Chevalier Jean du Teil]] meant that the French artillery was the finest in Europe. The Revolutionary Artillery was responsible for several of the Republic's early victories; for example at [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]], on [[13 Vendémiaire]], and at [[Battle of Lodi|Lodi]]. The revolutionary cannon played a vital role in their success. The cannon continued to have a dominating role on the battlefield throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

==Cavalry==
[[File:Frrepublicancav.jpg|thumb|right|Hussar, line cavalryman and line infantryman, 1795–96.]]

The cavalry was seriously affected by the Revolution. The majority of officers had been of aristocratic birth and had fled France during the final stages of the monarchy or to avoid the subsequent Terror. Many French cavalrymen joined the émigré army of the Prince du Conde. Two entire regiments, the ''Hussards du Saxe'' and the ''15éme Cavalerie (Royal Allemande)'' defected to the Austrians.

Lacking not only trained officers, but also mounts and equipment, the Revolutionary Cavalry became the worst equipped arm of the Revolutionary Army. By Mid 1793, the paper organisation of the Revolutionary Army included twenty six heavy cavalry regiments, two regiments of carabiniers, twenty dragoon regiments, eighteen regiments of ''chasseurs à cheval'' and ten hussar regiments. In reality, it was seldom that any of these regiments reached even half strength. However, unlike the infantry, where all battalions of the old Royal Army were merged with freshly raised volunteers to form new ''demi-brigades'', the cavalry retained their regimental identities throughout the revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. As one example, the ''Regiment de Chasseurs d'Alsace'' (raised in 1651) was renamed the ''1er Regiment de Chasseurs'' in 1791 but otherwise remained unchanged until it was finally disbanded after Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;Emir Bukhari, page 15 &quot;Napoleon's Line Chasseurs&quot;, ISBN 0-85045-269-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerostatic corps==
{{Main|French Aerostatic Corps}}
The French Aerostatic Corps (''compagnie d'aérostiers'') was the  first French [[air force]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Beadle]] and Ian Harrison, ''First, Lasts &amp; Onlys: Military'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1794 to use [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], primarily for [[reconnaissance]]. The first military use of the balloon occurred on 2 June 1794, when it was used for reconnaissance during an enemy bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;F. Stansbury Haydon, Military Ballooning During the Early Civil War, pp.5-15&lt;/ref&gt;  On 22 June, the corps received orders to move the balloon to the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|plain of Fleurus]], in front of the Austrian troops at [[Charleroi]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Coulston Gillispie, Science and Polity in France: The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Years, pp. 372-373&lt;/ref&gt;

He had been a [[cathedral]] canon but had gained notoriety as a member  of the [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes#Municipal administration|City Council of Gap]] in July 1790.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Williams, ''The Letters of Dominique Chaix, Botanist-Curé''(Springer Science &amp; Business Media,  2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in Gap in 1747.

==Bishop==
His predecessor as Arch[[bishop of Embrun]], Pierre-Louis Leysin opposed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy decided by the decree of 12 July 1790 and refused to take the oath of allegiance. Ignatius Cazeneuve [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Gap Cathedral]] was appointed [[constitutional bishop]] of [[Hautes-Alpes]] department in March 1791 to replace him  and was crowned in [[Paris]] on 3 April. Pierre-Louis Leyssin, driven from [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], took refuge in the Sardinian States and was [[excommunicate]]d. Jacques-Joseph Rous of Mazelière, vicar-general of the former archbishop  became the de facto head of the diocese, until he also was deported. 
Ignatius Cazeneuve, however, resigned and was replaced by [[André Garnier]] on January 10, 1800 in [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]]. After signing the Concordat, Cazeneuve retracts his oath and died six years latter in 1806, reconciled with the [[Roman Catholic church|Catholic Church]].

==Politician==
[[File:Bouchot - Le general Bonaparte au Conseil des Cinq-Cents.jpg|thumb|right|[[council of five hundred|Council of the 500]].]] Ignatius Cazeneuve was elected to the Convention in March 1791 and was elected as a member for  the [[French Alps]] in September 1792 until March 1798. He has served on the Plain benches.

However, he denounced also the excesses of the Revolution. During this period, 14 February 1793, he works with the administrator responsible for monitoring the sale of national assets, but in this role helped support his [[nephew]] [[Stephen Gregory Cazeneuve]], then [[captain]] of [[grenadiers]] of the battalion of the French Alps.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Lemas, Ignace de Cazeneuve, évêque constitutionnel des Hautes-Alpes, membre de la Convention, (Typo. G. Née, 1890), p39 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ignace de Cazeneuve, in Robert et Cougny, Dictionnaire des parlementaires français, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

He spoke in the trial of Louis XVI for the &quot;detention and banishment&quot; of the king&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius Cazeneuve, [http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=11536387501&amp;searchurl=sortby%3D17%26an%3Dcazeneuve%2520ignace%2520de  L.A.S. au citoyen administrateur chargé de la surveillance de la vente des biens nationaux].  (Published (Gap), 1793).&lt;/ref&gt; and then made part of the [[council of five hundred]].

==French Revolutionary Wars==
Firstly commanding officer of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], he settled in Paris in September 1790. He was required by the municipality to gather volunteers for the revolutionary [[Rue des Lombards|Lombards]] section in Paris. He became commandant of the Oratoire Battalion then of an armed section of the [[Gardes Françaises]] the 12 August 1792.

In September 1792, he was elected lieutenant colonel commanding the Lombards battalion, took part in the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]] campaign&lt;ref name=&quot;Chuquet1792&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Chuquet|title=Les guerres de la Révolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Drama4JEwb4C&amp;pg=PA47|year=1792|publisher=Léon Chailley|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; then followed [[Charles François Dumouriez|Durnouriez]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revue du nord|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogRAAQAAMAAJ|year=1919|publisher=Faculté des lettres et sciences humaines.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary commandant in [[Brussels]] during the French occupation, he was one of the leaders of the [[Isaac René Guy le Chapelier#Le Chapelier and Popular Societies|popular society]]. When the Belgian Primary Assemblies were convened concerning the decision to attach Belgium to France, he went to [[Ghent]] the 22 February 1793 to assist the Commissioner [[Alexandre Nicolas Courtois|Courtois]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bégin1829&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Émile Auguste Nicolas Jules Bégin|title=Biographie de la Moselle: ou, Histoire par ordre alphab́etique de toutes les personnes nées dans ce département, qui se sont fait remarquer par leurs actions, leurs talens, leurs écrits, leurs vertus, ou leurs crimes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5APAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA299|year=1829|publisher=Verronnais|pages=299–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of their action, 2,000 Ghent citizens wished to attach Belgium to France.

He was assigned in Lille by [[Blaise Duval]] the 31 March 1793, appointed National Commissioner in [[Cambrai]] the 18 April to rally and retrain the troops from Belgium, then appointed temporary commandant of Cambrai by [[Auguste Marie Henri Picot de Dampierre|Dampierre]] in place of [[Claude Aubert]] ([[:fr:Claude Aubert (militaire)|fr]]).

The 25 April 1793, he was appointed military governor of Lille. Promoted brigadier general in the [[Army of the Coasts of Brest]] on 15 May 1793, the [[Executive Council (French Revolution)|Executive Council]] ([[:fr:Conseil exécutif (Révolution française)|fr]]) ordered him to stay in Lille to assist [[Jean-Baptiste Favart|Favart]] ([[:fr:Jean-Baptiste Favart)|fr]]) in &quot;''operations having defence implications for this town by an officer who was already familiar with it, as a civic, energetic and militarily well-qualified partner''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Valenciennes&gt;{{cite web | url = https://archive.org/details/valenciennes00chuqgoog | title = Valenciennes (1793) | author = Arthur Chuquet | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | format = | work = | publisher = American Libraries| pages = | language =fr | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&quot;''toutes les opérations relatives à la défense de cette place par un officier qui la connaissait déjà, et sur le civisme, l'activité et les talents militaires duquel on pouvait compter''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dismissed for a first time by [[Pierre Joseph Duhem|Duhem]] and [[Gaspard-Jean-Joseph Lesage-Senault|Lesage-Senault]] because of a dispute with the general [[Antoine Nicolas Collier|Lamarlière]], he was imprisoned for indiscipline. But [[Maximilien de Robespierre|Robespierre]] himself took the Lavalette case to the [[National Convention]] and the general was freed of the charges the 24 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamel1867&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest Hamel|title=Histoire de Robespierre d'après des papiers de famille: La Montagne. 1867|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noEfAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=1867|publisher=Lacroix, Verboeckhoven &amp; Cie|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinstated the 3 August, he reorganized the [[French Revolutionary Army|revolutionary army]] in Lille headed by [[Simon Camille Dufresse|Dufresse]] ([[:fr:Simon Camille Dufresse|fr]]). But the 9 December 1793, [[François Louis Bourdon|Bourdon de l'Oise]] criticized him before the National Convention for marrying a German emigrated princess and for denouncing patriots.&lt;ref name=Valenciennes/&gt;

The two [[representatives on mission]] [[Nicolas Hentz|Hentz]] et [[Guiot de Saint-Florent|Florent-Guiot]] ([[:fr:Florent-Guiot|fr]]) wound up his army and placed Lavalette under provisional arrest. Then, on 18 December 1793, on request of Duhem, the Convention adopted a decree which ordered that he had to be transferred to Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;chassin&quot;/&gt;

Thanks to Robespierre, on 23 [[Floréal]] (12 May 1794), the [[Committee of Public Safety]] adopted a decree which ordered his release and his reinstatement.

Lavalette asked to serve under [[François Hanriot|Hanriot]] as a commander of a battalion of the French National Guard and joined the 17th division the 24 May 1794.

As Hanriot assistant and Robespierrist, he was guillotined the 10 [[Thermidor]] Year II (28 July 1794) in the wake of [[Thermidorian Reaction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chassin&quot;/&gt;

The '''causes of the [[French revolution]]''' can be attributed to several intertwining factors:
* Cultural: The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy desacralized the authority of the monarchy and the [[Catholic Church]], and promoted a new society based on [[reason]] instead of [[traditions]]. 
* Social: The emergence of an influential [[bourgeoisie]] which was formally part of the [[Estates of the Realm|Third Estate]] (commoners) but had evolved into a caste with its own agenda and aspired to political equality with the [[clergy]] (First Estate) and the [[French nobility|aristocracy]] (Second Estate). 
* Financial: France's debt, aggravated by [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French involvement in the American Revolution]], led [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to implement new taxations and to reduce privileges.
* Political: Louis XVI faced virulent opposition from [[Parlement|provincial parlements]] which were the spearheads of the privileged classes' resistance to royal reforms.
* Economic: The [[deregulation]] of the [[Food grain|grain]] market, advocated by [[Physiocracy|liberal economists]], resulted in an increase in bread prices. In period of bad harvests, it would lead to food scarcity which would [[Flour War|prompt the masses to revolt]].

All these factors created a [[revolution]]ary atmosphere and a tricky situation for Louis XVI. In order to resolve the crisis, the king summoned the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] in May 1789 and, as it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estates formed a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], against the wishes of the king, signaling the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].

==The Revolutionary Situation==
The essence of the revolutionary situation which existed in France in the 1780s was the bankruptcy of [[Louis XVI of France|the king]], and hence the state. This economic crisis was due to the rapidly increasing costs of government and to the overwhelming costs incurred by fighting two major wars: the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter McPhee|title=The French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLCnBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT34|year=2015|publisher=Melbourne U.|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; These costs could not be met from the usual sources of state revenue. Since the 1770s, several attempts by different ministers to introduce financial stability had failed.&lt;ref&gt;David Thomson, ''Europe Since Napoleon'' (1957) pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The taxation system was burdensome upon the middle class and the more prosperous peasants, given that the nobles were largely able to exempt themselves from it. As a result, there was &quot;an insistent demand&quot; for reform of these abuses of privilege, for an equitable means of taxation and for improved government processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Thomson (historian)|David Thomson]] argued that the ''bourgeoisie'' and peasantry had &quot;something to lose, not merely something to gain&quot; in their demands for a fairer society and this fear too was a major factor in the revolutionary situation.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social inequality==
[[File:Troisordres.jpg|thumb|The Third Estate (commoners) carrying the First (clergy) and Second  Estate (nobility) on his back.]]
The population of France in the 1780s was about 26 million, of whom 21 million lived in agriculture. Few of these owned enough land to support a family and most were forced to take on extra work as poorly paid labourers on larger farms. There were regional differences but, by and large, French peasants were generally better off than those in countries like Russia or Poland. Even so, hunger was a daily problem which became critical in years of poor harvest and the condition of most French peasants was poor.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental issue of poverty was aggravated by [[social inequality]] as all peasants were liable to pay taxes, from which the nobility could claim immunity, and feudal dues payable to a local ''seigneur'' or lord. Similarly, the destination of tithes which the peasants were obliged to pay to their local churches was a cause of grievance as it was known that the majority of parish priests were poor and the contribution was being paid to an aristocratic, and usually absentee, abbot.&lt;ref name=CH30&gt;Hibbert, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The clergy numbered about 100,000 and yet they owned 10% of the land. The Catholic Church maintained a rigid hierarchy as abbots and bishops were all members of the nobility and canons were all members of wealthy bourgeois families. As an institution, it was both rich and powerful. As with the nobility, it paid no taxes and merely contributed a grant to the state every five years, the amount of which was self-determined. The upper echelons of the clergy had considerable influence over government policy.&lt;ref name=CH30/&gt;

Dislike of the nobility was especially intense. Successive French kings and their ministers had tried with limited success to suppress the power of the nobles but, in the last quarter of the 18th century, &quot;the aristocracy were beginning once again to tighten their hold on the machinery of government&quot;.&lt;ref name=CH31&gt;Hibbert, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment Ideas==

A growing number of the French citizenry had absorbed the ideas of &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;freedom of the individual&quot; as presented by [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Denis Diderot]] and other philosophers and social theorists of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt; Vincenzo Ferrone, ''The Enlightenment: History of an Idea'' ((Princeton UP, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Revolution]] demonstrated that it was plausible for Enlightenment ideas about how a government should be organized to actually be put into practice. Some American diplomats, like [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], had lived in Paris, where they consorted freely with members of the French intellectual class. Furthermore, contact between American revolutionaries and the French troops who served in North America helped spread revolutionary ideas to the French people.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''The age of the Democratic Revolution: a political history of Europe and America, 1760–1800'' (2nd ed. 2014) pp. 177–213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material strengths==
[[Kingdom of France|France]] in 1787, although it faced some difficulties, was one of the most economically capable nations of Europe. The French population exceeded 28 million; of Europe's 178 to 188 millions, only [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] had a greater population (37 to 41 million).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bairoch&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1989|p=941}}&lt;/ref&gt; France was also among the most urbanized countries of Europe, the population of Paris was second only to that of [[London]] (approximately 500,000 vs. 800,000),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bairoch&quot; /&gt; and six of Europe's 35 larger cities were French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1989|p=943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lepetit, ''The Pre-industrial Urban System: France 1740–1840'' (Cambridge UP, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other measures confirm France's inherent strength. France had 5.3 million of Europe's approximately 30 million male peasants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bairoch_a&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1989|p=945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its area under cultivation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bairoch_a&quot; /&gt; productivity per unit area,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1989|p=946}}&lt;/ref&gt; level of industrialization, and gross national product &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1989|p=949}}&lt;/ref&gt; (about 14% of the continental European product, excluding Russia, and 6% to 10% above the level elsewhere in Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1989|pp=959–963}}&lt;/ref&gt;) all placed France near the very top of the scale. In short, while it may have lagged slightly behind the [[Low Countries]], and possibly [[Switzerland]], in per capita wealth, the sheer size of the French economy made it the premier economic power of continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph W. Greenlaw, ed., ''The economic origins of the French revolution: poverty or prosperity?'' (Heath, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debt===
Historian John Shovlin states, &quot;It is a truism that the French Revolution was touched off by the near bankruptcy of the state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Shovlin|title=The Political Economy of Virtue: Luxury, Patriotism, and the Origins of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhL3TaoDqEUC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2007|publisher=Cornell UP|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the burden of the national debt that led this to the long-running [[financial crisis]] of the French government.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Nelson White, &quot;The French Revolution and the politics of government finance, 1770–1815.&quot; ''Journal of Economic History'' 55#2 (1995): 227–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the revolution, the French debt had risen from 8 billion to 12 billion [[French livres#Eighteenth century|livres]]. Extravagant expenditures on luxuries by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], whose rule began in 1774, were compounded by debts that were run up during the reign of his even-more-profligate predecessor, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (who reigned from 1715 to 1774). Heavy expenditures to conduct losing the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), and France's backing of the Americans in their [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]], ran the tab up an even further 1.3 billion livres &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stacy Schiff|authorlink=Stacy Schiff|title=A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vhpYe99Tn4C&amp;pg=PT18|year=2006|publisher=Macmillan|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XV and his ministers were deeply unhappy about Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War and, in the years following the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], they began drawing up a long-term plan that would involve constructing a larger navy and building an anti-British coalition of allies. In theory, this would eventually lead to a war of revenge and see France regain its colonies from Britain. In practice, it resulted in a mountain of debts.

On the advice of his mistress, the [[Marquise de Pompadour]], the king supported the policy of fiscal justice designed by d'Arnouville. In order to finance the budget deficit, which amounted to 100 million [[French livre|livres]] in 1745, Machault d'Arnouville created a tax of 5% on all revenues (the ''[[vingtième]]''), a measure that affected the privileged classes as well as the rest of the population. Still, expenditures outpaced revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth N. Jassie, &quot;We Don't Have a King: Popular Protest and the Image of the Illegitimate King in the Reign of Louis XV&quot;. Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750–1850: Proceedings 1994 23: 211–19. {{ISSN|0093-2574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Louis XV failed to overcome these fiscal problems, mainly because he was incapable of harmonizing the conflicting parties at court and arriving at coherent economic policies. Worse, Louis seemed to be aware of the anti-monarchist forces that were threatening his family's rule, yet he failed to do anything to stop them.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Nation: France from Louis XV to Napoleon, (1715–99), a scholarly bibliography by Colin Jones (2002) pp.&amp;nbsp;124, 132–33, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XV's death in 1774 saw the French monarchy at its nadir, politically, morally, and financially.

Under the new king, [[Louis XVI]], radical financial reforms by his ministers, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], angered the nobles and were blocked by the ''[[parlement]]s'' who insisted that the king did not have the legal right to levy new taxes. So, in 1776, Turgot was dismissed and Malesherbes resigned. They were replaced by [[Jacques Necker]], who supported the American Revolution and proceeded with a policy of taking large international loans instead of raising taxes.
[[File:Necker, Jacques - Duplessis.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jacques Necker]]]]

France sent [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]], [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and [[François Joseph Paul, marquis de Grasetilly, comte de Grasse|de Grasse]], along with large land and naval forces, to help the Americans. French aid proved decisive in forcing the main British army to surrender at the [[Siege of Yorktown|Battle of Yorktown]] in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Dull, The French Navy, and American Independence: A Study of Arms and Diplomacy, 1774–1787 (1975) ISBN 0-691-06920-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans gained their independence, and the war ministry rebuilt the French army. However, the British [[Battle of the Saintes|sank the main French fleet]] in 1782, and France gained little, except for the colonies of [[Tobago]] and [[Senegal]], from the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] that concluded the war. The war cost 1,066 million French livres, a huge sum, that was financed by new loans at high interest rates, but no new taxes were imposed. Necker concealed the crisis from the public by explaining only that ordinary revenues exceeded ordinary expenses, and by not mentioning the loans at all.&lt;ref&gt;On finance see William Doyle, Oxford History of the French Revolution (1989) pp.&amp;nbsp;67–74&lt;/ref&gt;

When Necker's tax policy failed miserably, Louis dismissed him, and replaced him, in 1783, with [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]], who increased public spending in an attempt to &quot;buy&quot; the country's way out of debt. This policy also failed; therefore, Louis convened the [[Assembly of Notables]] in 1787 to discuss a revolutionary new fiscal reform proposed by Calonne. When the nobles were told the extent of the debt, they were shocked; however, the shock did not motivate them to rally behind the plan – but to reject it. This negative turn of events signaled to Louis that he had lost the ability to rule as an absolute monarch, and he fell into depression.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardman, Louis XVI, Yale university Press, New Haven and London, 1993 p.&amp;nbsp;126&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain, too, was heavily indebted as a result of these conflicts; but Britain had far more advanced fiscal institutions in place to deal with it. France was a wealthier country than Britain, and its national debt was no greater than the British one. In each country, servicing the debt accounted for about one-half the government's annual expenditure; where they differed was in the effective rates of interest. In France, the debt was financed at almost twice the interest rate as the debt across the Channel. This demanded a much higher level of taxation and less flexibility in raising money to deal with unforeseen emergencies. (See also [[Eden Agreement]].)

[[Edmund Burke]], no friend of the revolution, wrote in 1790: &quot;the public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.&quot; Because the nobles successfully defended their privileges, the king of France lacked the means to impose a &quot;just and proportioned&quot; tax. The desire to do so led directly to the decision in 1788 to call the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] into session.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/History/DF_revolution.shtml The French Revolution]. Discoverfrance.net. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial strain of servicing old debt and the excesses of the current royal court caused dissatisfaction with the monarchy, contributed to national unrest, and culminated in the French Revolution of 1789.

===Taxation===

Louis XVI, his ministers, and the widespread French nobility had become immensely unpopular. This was a consequence of the fact that peasants and, to a lesser extent, the poor and those aspiring to be ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', were burdened with ruinously high taxes levied to support a wealthy monarchy, along with aristocrats and their sumptuous, often gluttonous lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mathias and Patrick O'Brien, &quot;Taxation in Britain and France, 1715–1810. A comparison of the social and economic incidence of taxes collected for the central governments.&quot; ''Journal of European Economic History'' 5#3 (1976): 601+.&lt;/ref&gt;

France raised most of its tax revenue internally, with a notable deficit regarding external customs [[tariffs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Horn, ''The Path Not Taken: French Industrialization in the Age of Revolution, 1750-1830'' MIT 2006 ISBN 978-026208352-2&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes on commerce consisted of internal tariffs among the regions of France. This set up an arbitrary tax-barrier (sometimes, as [[Wall of the Ferme générale|in Paris, in physical form]]) at every regional boundary, and these barriers prevented France from developing as a unified market. Collections of taxes, such as the extremely unpopular salt tax, the ''[[gabelle]]'', were contracted to private collectors (&quot;[[Ferme générale|tax farmers]]&quot;), who, like all farmers, preoccupied themselves with making their holdings grow. So, they collected, quite legitimately, far more than required, remitted the tax to the State, and pocketed the remainder. These unwieldy systems led to arbitrary and unequal collection of France's [[consumption tax]]es. (See also [[Wall of the Farmers-General]], [[Jean Chouan]], [[Octroi]], [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux#Architecture for the ferme générale|Claude Nicolas Ledoux]], and the [[History of the British salt tax in India|Indian salt tax]].)

[[File:Hôtel de la gabelle Bernay.jpg|thumb|320px|Hôtel de la gabelle (House of the Salt Tax) in [[Bernay, Eure]], Upper Normandy, built in 1750 by Bréant and [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].]]
Peasants and nobles alike were required to pay one-tenth of their income or produce to the church (the ''[[tithe]]''). Peasants paid a land tax to the state (the ''[[taille]]''),&lt;ref&gt;The taille was meant to pay for the war effort; nobility was exempted as they considered their physical participation in the war as a &quot;blood tax&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; a 5% property tax (the ''[[vingtième]]''). All paid a tax on the number of people in the family (''[[Tax per head|capitation]]''), depending on the status of the taxpayer (from poor to prince). Further royal and [[Manorialism|seigneurial obligations]] might be paid in several ways: in labor (the ''[[corvée#France|corvée]]''), in kind, or, rarely, in coin. Peasants were also obligated to their landlords for: rent in cash (the ''[[:fr:Cens (droit seigneurial)|cens]]''), a payment related to their amount of annual production (the ''[[champart]]''), and taxes on the use of the nobles' mills, wine-presses, and bakeries (the ''[[banalité]]s''). In good times, the taxes were burdensome; in harsh times, they were devastating. After a less-than-fulsome harvest, people would starve to death during the winter.

Tax collection was farmed out (privatized) to &quot;fermiers&quot;, through a system of public bidding.&lt;ref&gt;Louis XV introduced a fixed remuneration scheme for tax collectors in 1769.&lt;/ref&gt; Public officials bought their positions from the king, sometimes on an annual basis, sometimes ''in perpetuity''. Often an additional tax, called &quot;paulette&quot; was paid by the holders of an office to upgrade their position to one that could be passed along as an inheritance. Naturally, holders of these offices tried to reimburse themselves by milking taxpayers as hard as possible. For instance, in a civil lawsuit, judges required that both parties pay for the costs of the trial (called the ''épices'', the spices);&lt;ref&gt;The épices were no bribes, as they did not go to the judge directly, but to a common fund, and served to pay for the costs incurred by the judges, who had to remunerate their auxiliaries - see Albert N. Hamscher, The Parlement of Paris after the Fronde 1653–1673, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; this, effectively, put justice out of the reach of all but the wealthy.

The system also exempted the nobles and the clergy from taxes (with the exception of a modest [[quit-rent]], an ''[[ad valorem]]'' tax on land). The tax burden, therefore, devolved to the peasants, wage-earners, and the professional and business classes, also known as the third estate. Further, people from less-privileged walks of life were blocked from acquiring even petty positions of power in the regime. This caused further resentment.

===Failure of reforms===
During the reigns of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (1715–1774) and [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (1774–1792), several ministers, most notably [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Jacques Necker|Necker]], proposed revisions to the French tax system so as to include the nobles as taxpayers, but these proposals were not adopted because of resistance from the ''[[parlement]]s'' (provincial courts of appeal). Members of these courts bought their positions from the king, as well as the right to transfer their positions hereditarily through payment of an annual fee, the ''[[Paulette (tax)|paulette]]''. Membership in such courts, or appointment to other public positions, often led to elevation to the nobility (the so-called [[Nobles of the Robe]], as distinguished from the nobility of ancestral military origin, the [[Nobles of the Sword]].) While these two categories of nobles were often at odds, they both sought to retain their privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Harris, ''Necker: reform statesman of the Ancien Régime'' (U of California Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The need to raise taxes placed the king at odds with the nobles and the upper bourgeoisie, he appointed as his finance ministers, &quot;rising men&quot; (to use [[François Mignet]]'s insightful term), usually of non-noble origin. These commoners, Turgot, [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Chrétien de Malesherbes]], and Jacques Necker lobbied for reforms in taxation and other moves toward moderation, such as Necker's attempts to reduce the lavishness of the king's court. Each one failed. Instead, the &quot;[[Parkinson's law]]&quot; of bureaucratic overextended waste prevailed, to the detriment of the gentry and other non-seigneurial classes. In contrast, [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]], appointed finance minister in 1783, restored lavish spending reminiscent of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. By the time Calonne brought together the [[Assembly of Notables]] on 22 February 1787 to address the financial situation, France had reached a state of virtual bankruptcy; no one would lend the king money sufficient to meet the expenses of the royal court and the government. According to Mignet, the loans amounted to 1.64 billion ''livres'', and the annual deficit was 140 millions.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Faccarello,  &quot;Galiani, Necker and Turgot. A debate on economic reform and policy in 18th Century France.&quot; ''History of Economic Thought'' 1.3 (1994): 519–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calonne was succeeded by his chief critic, [[Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne]], [[archbishop of Sens]], but the fundamental situation was unchanged: the government had no credit. To address this, the Assembly of Notables sanctioned &quot;the establishment of provincial assemblies, [[Corn laws|regulation of the corn trade]], abolition of [[corvée]]s, and a new [[stamp tax]]&quot;, but the assembly dispersed on 25 May 1787 without actually installing a longer-term program with prospects for success.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Nelson White,  &quot;Was there a solution to the Ancien Régime's Financial Dilemma?.&quot; ''Journal of Economic History'' 49.03 (1989): 545–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deregulation and hunger==

===Before the Revolution===
In [[Ancien Régime France]], bread was the main source of food for poor peasants and the king was required to ensure the food supply of his subjects, the king was affectionately nicknamed ''le premier boulanger du royaume'' (&quot;prime baker of the kingdom&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hms7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22premier+boulanger+du+royaume%22&amp;dq=%22premier+boulanger+du+royaume%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIp5bt6O3SxwIVQ7MUCh1iEQZH &quot;Labyrinthe, Numéros 20 à 22&quot;, 2005, p. 58]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the role of the royal police was far more involved than simply upholding the law. Police held responsibility over many systems in society, even street sweeping, it also exercised a strict control over food supply.&lt;ref&gt;[Andress, David. French Society in Revolution, 1789–1799. France: Manchester University Press, 1999, pp. 16–18]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to maintain [[social order]], the grain market was submitted to harsh rules to ensure the quality of the bread and its availability at all time and for the entire population. Grain merchants were viewed with suspicion, they were called &quot;the most cruel enemies of the people&quot; because they were suspected to mix flour with other products (such as [[chalk]] or crushed [[bone]]s) or to hoard grains to raise artificially the prices of this vital commodity. The Ancien Régime favoured a &quot;[[moral economy]]&quot; where cupidity was moderated by strict regulations. The police controlled the purity of the flour and made sure that no one would hide grains to drive up prices. Food scarcity was common in the 18th century, but the grain police would forbid exportations from regions facing bad harvests and would import grain from regions enjoying overproduction. It could also force a merchant to [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dump the price]] of his flour (he was later compensated for his loss in times of abundance).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kaplan,Jean-Philippe de Tonnac, &quot;La France et son pain: Histoire d'une passion&quot; [https://books.google.com/books?id=UHA7fvHVBFkC&amp;pg=PT94&amp;dq=police+des+farines+ancien+r%C3%A9gime&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7kCVc-kLsrpUvuxgKAF&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=police%20des%20farines%20ancien%20r%C3%A9gime&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deregulation of the grain industry===
[[File:Turgot oval painting.jpg|thumb|Turgot's portrait.]]
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the [[physiocrat]] school of economy emerged. The physiocrats, or ''économistes'' as they called themselves, had a great impact on [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], [[Louis XVI]]'s [[Controller-General of Finances]]. Their opinion on what government economic policy should be was summarized in the term [[Vincent de Gournay]] laid claim to: &quot;laissez faire, laissez passer&quot;, meaning leave it alone and let it pass, also known as the &quot;[[invisible hand]]&quot; notion. Turgot passionately defended Gournay's belief in &quot;[[laissez-faire]]&quot; economic principles in his writing &quot;Éloge de Gournay&quot;. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;&gt;Hart, http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/TurgotBio.html&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Turgot abolished police regulations and established free trade in grain on 13 September 1774.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralia.revues.org/2 Nicolas Bourguinat, &quot;L'État et les violences frumentaires en France sous la Restauration et la Monarchie de Juillet&quot;, Ruralia, ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results of the revolution===
During the period before the spring harvest of 1775, the cereal reserves were exhausted while new crops had not yet arrived. In spring 1775, famine arose in this new context: before Turgot's edict, every region faced its own shortages, so that some would have suffered a genuine famine while others would have been totally spared and supplied through stable prices; a royal intervention would have been requested, and without a doubt obtained, to assure the supply of the regions most affected. With liberalization, owners of grain started to speculate by [[Hoarding (economics)|storing grain]]. They also tend to buy en masse in areas of good harvests to sell in areas of bad harvests where profits could be greater, causing significant price increases and shortages all over and affecting more people more quickly. Changes to grain and bread supply had serious implications, and was met with disorder. This conflict was known as the [[Flour War of 1775]]. Reports from those that controlled the flow of grain stated there were problems with the grain harvest which caused shortages and less grain availability. The price of grain also increased, and became hard for some to afford. News of a grain shortage was met with skepticism and frustration rose from higher prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andress&quot;&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt; Those in opposition of the reform rioted, and seized grain that came in on shipments. They offered what they felt was the &quot;[[just price]]&quot; for it. This demonstrated a way in which the people took some power back into their own hands. This practice was known as &quot;taxation populaire&quot;, or popular taxation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andress&quot;&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were documented efforts to deal with the grain shortage problems, such as increasing shipments from foreign countries, beliefs that the famine was intentionally orchestrated by [[Louis XVI]], through the &quot;[[Pacte de Famine]]&quot;, emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andress&quot;&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt; Turgot repressed the riots and restored controls over the grain market. The idea of free trade of grain was discredited and the economic experiment distanced the masses from the government in Versailles. The Flour War can be seen as a prelude to the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourguinat|first=Nicolas|title=L'État et les violences frumentaires en France sous la Restauration et la Monarchie de Juillet|url=http://ruralia.revues.org/2|work=Ruralia|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fear of famine became an ever-present dread for the lower strata of the Third Estate, and rumors of the &quot;Pacte de Famine&quot; to starve the poor were still rampant and readily believed.&lt;ref name=Doyle121&gt;Doyle, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Mere rumors of food shortage led to the [[Réveillon riots]] in April 1789. Rumors of a plot aiming to destroy wheat crops in order to starve the population provoked the [[Great Fear]] in the summer of 1789. The hunger and despair of the Parisian women was also the original impetus for the [[Women's March on Versailles]] in October 1789, they wanted not just one meal but the assurance that bread would once again be plentiful and cheap.&lt;ref name=Soboul155&gt;Soboul, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two years prior to the revolution (1788–89) saw meager harvests and harsh winters, possibly because of a strong [[El Niño]] cycle &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard H. Grove|title=Global Impact of the 1789–93 El Niño|journal=Nature|volume=393|year=1998|pages=318–19|doi=10.1038/30636}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by the 1783 [[Laki]] eruption in [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, C.A., 1992. &quot;The climatic effects of the 1783 Laki eruption&quot; in C. R. Harrington (Ed.), The Year Without a Summer? Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, pp. 58–77&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Little Ice Age]]'' also affected farmers' choices of crops to plant; in other parts of Europe, peasant farmers had adopted the [[potato]] as its [[staple crop]]. The potato had been introduced to France during the 16th century and despite resistance had largely supplanted the [[turnip]] and [[rutabaga]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Histoires de légumes&quot; by M. Pitrat and C. Foury, Institut National de la recherche agronomoique, 2003, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Despite encouragement from individuals like [[Antoine Parmentier]] and [[Louis XVI]], grain was still a much more popular staple crop in France. This was partially because potatoes were seen as more difficult to transport and store than grain.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Langer, &quot;American Foods and Europe's Population Growth 1750–1850&quot; ''Journal of Social History'' 8#2 (1975) pp. 51–66. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3786266 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transparency==
H. F. Helmolt argued that the issue was not so much the debt ''per se'', but the way the debt was refracted through the lens of Enlightenment principles and the increasing power of [[Estates General (France)|third-estate]] creditors, that is, commoners who held the government's paper.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Properly speaking, the people ought to have been accustomed to the fact that the French government did not fulfill its financial obligations, for since the time of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], that is, within two centuries, it had failed to meet its obligations fifty-six times. In earlier days such catastrophes had not been announced and publicly discussed. Now all France, which for two generations had been worked upon by the party of [[rationalism]], shared the outcry against the financial situation.&lt;ref name=h120&gt;H. F. Helmolt, ''History of the World'', Volume VII, Dodd Mead 1902, pp. 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The struggle with the ''parlements'' and nobles to enact reformist measures displayed the extent of the disintegration of the ''Ancien Régime''. In short order, Protestants regained their rights, and Louis XVI was pressured to produce an annual disclosure of the state of his finances. He also pledged to reconvene the [[French States-General|Estates-General]] within five years. Despite the pretense that France operated under an [[absolute monarchy]], it became clear that the royal government could not successfully implement the changes it desired without the consent of the nobility. The financial crisis had become a political crisis as well,&lt;ref name=h120/&gt; and the French Revolution loomed just beyond the horizon.

'''Honoré-Nicolas-Marie Duveyrier''' (6 December 1753 – 25 May 1839) was an 18th–19th-century French lawyer, politician and playwright.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnrs&quot;&gt;''Grands notables du premier empire'', éditions du CNRS, (p.&amp;nbsp;110-112) {{BNF|346403776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
The second son of Noble-Gaspard Duveyrier and Marie-Madeleine de Nivelet, Honoré Duveyrier received a military education in Perpignan before devoting himself to law in Paris. Once he was become a successful lawyer, he was received in 1779 in [[Parlement]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cnrs&quot;/&gt;

He first married Adélaïde-Marie-Anne Lespardat with whom he had two children: Anne-Honoré-Joseph Duveyrier, called [[Mélesville]], and [[Charles Duveyrier]]. En deuxièmes noces, he married Philippine-Marguerite Servins, with no offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnrs&quot;/&gt;

Three days before his [[flight to Varennes]], [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] sent him in a mission to the [[Louis V Joseph de Bourbon-Condé|Prince of Condé]], but he was taken prisoner by the Austrians. Upon his return, he was one of five commissioners delegated August 11, 1792 by the {{Interlanguage link multi|section des Piques|fr}} to the General Council of the  [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]]. He was imprisoned at the instigation of [[Robespierre]]. After his release, he was employed abroad as Commissioner for supplying the French armies. In 1796, he resumed his practice in Paris, before becoming Deputy Head of Finance in Rome, where he acquired a large fortune. He then became President of the Court of Appeal of Montpellier.

Around 1808, he was president of the Montpellier Court of Appeal and became Baron of the Empire in 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnrs&quot;/&gt;

Died in 1839, he is buried at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] (35th division).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=3450 DUVEYRIER Honoré Nicolas Marie, baron (1753-1839)]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Barth was aided by Thomas Jefferson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Thomas Jefferson to John Joseph de Barth, 17 March 1792|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-23-02-0250|website=National Archives: Founders Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Washington,&lt;ref name=&quot;Prospects&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospects for the Gallipolis Settlement: French Diplomatic Dispatches|url=http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohj/search/display.php?page=1&amp;ipp=20&amp;searchterm=barth&amp;vol=103&amp;pages=41-56|pages=41–56|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexander Hamilton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Hamilton to Arthur St. Clair, [19 May 1790]|url=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s152/sh/60990ed9-ab21-44c7-9e30-791bd93984b9/66485bf462c80da20f30ab1d78fcb201}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first two hoping to sell their Ohio Valley lands to the Frenchman.  De Barth showed his appreciation with gifts to Jefferson from France and the American frontier, including a French art book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Thomas Jefferson from John Joseph de Barth, 29 October 1792|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-24-02-0496|website=National Archives: Founders Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; buffalo skin, and rather mysterious &quot;tooth of a carnivorous elephant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Thomas Jefferson from John Joseph de Barth, 3 [March] 1791|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-19-02-0098|website=National Archives: Founders Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Barth and his followers were aristocrats and city merchants, not pioneer material, and struggled with land speculators, Indians, and the wilderness.  The aging de Barth soon moved on, purchasing a manor at Springettsbury in Philadelphia.  This unfortunately turned out to be an even more dangerous move; shortly thereafter he succumbed to the [[1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic]], and his home became a hospital for the treatment of victims of yellow fever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosengarten&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosengarten|first1=Joseph George|title=The German Soldier in the Wars of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?jtp=163&amp;id=sngTAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=160–165|date=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Note: the records conflict on the manor location within the Springettsbury estate, one specifying the Bush Hill estate, while others contradict that.)

Jean Joseph de Barth was buried at [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosengarten&quot; /&gt;

The count's lands included 10,000 acres on the Elk River&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Mirror Virginia|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rowanorleman/family/media/Gardiner/Jean%20Joseph%20de%20Barth/JJ%20de%20Barth%2016%20Jun%201801%20Political%20Mirror%20Virginia.pdf|date=1801}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is now West Virginia.  This land passed to his son, General [[John de Barth Walbach|John Baptiste de Barth Walbach]], for whom the town of [[Wallback, West Virginia]] and the [[Wallback Wildlife Management Area]] are named.  Walbach, the oldest officer to ever serve in the U.S. Army, had in his long career commanded most American eastern seacoast forts and became adjutante general of the United States.

Another of de Barth's sons, Rev. Adolphus [[Louis de Barth]], was vicar general and administrator of the diocese of Philadelphia, and established several early frontier Catholic churches.  A daughter, Marie-Antoinette de Barth, became Mother Edmond-Paul, Abbotess of the Cistercian nuns of Notre-Dame-de-la-Misericorde at [[Koenigsbruck Abbey]] in the Forest of Haguenau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3GIhf3rZosC&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Des moniales face à la Révolution française: aux origines des Cisterciennes-Trappistines|last=|first=|date=1989|website=|publisher=|page=201|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Recollects convent was built in 1684 and is located in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[France]]. Its construction was ordered by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] for the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] monks who had been chaplaincies of his [[Army|armies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.versaillesgrandparc.fr/uploads/tx_egestiondoc/couventrecollets.pdf|title=Couvent des Récollets|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Versailles Grand parc|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

« '''Recollects''' » means a branch of the catholic order « the Franciscan » created in 16th century in France, Germany and Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chretienssocietes.revues.org/162|title=Pour faire l’histoire des Récollets en France (XVIe - XIXe siècles)|last=|first=|date=|website=Chrétiens et Sociétés|publisher=Frédéric Meyer|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, the convent has been used by the French army. Today, a plate at the front entrance serves to notify the public of its current occupant, « Service Technique des Bâtiments Fortifications et Travaux », a defense infrastructure office attached to [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Minister of Defense]].

Consequently, this place is closed to the public, except for certain occasions, like le Mois Molière (annual theater event organized by the city of Versailles).

== Localisation ==
Its address is 5 Seans avenue, Blackpool, England

It is situated just behind the newly opened space &quot;[[Cour des Senteurs|la Cour des Senteurs]]&quot;.

== History ==
In 1672-1673, as part of the installation preparation of the Court of France in Versailles, Louis XIV decided to demolish the Saint-Julien church, the only church in Versailles at that time, and constructed Saint-Julien for the Recollects in the new town situated on the opposite side of the Palace -today’s Notre-Dame area-.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Château de Versailles|last=Verlet|first=Pierre|publisher=Fayard|year=1988|isbn=2-213-01600-3|location=France|pages=117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1682, the Court of Louis XIV arrived in Versailles.

In 1682, [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], the first architect of the king, constructed the '''Grand Commun''', annex of the Palace on the former location of the first Saint-Julien Church.

In 1684, he started the construction of [[Church of Notre-Dame, Versailles|'''Notre-Dame''' church]], [[parish]] of the Palace and of the new town,  on the base of the new Saint-Julien which existed temporary.  For the parishioners of the old town, he built this Recollects Convent just behind the Grand Commun.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Versailles secret et insolite|last=Jacquet|first=Nicolas|publisher=Parigramme|year=2011|isbn=978-2-84096-664-7|location=France|pages=19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three bells from the convent are archived at [[Musée Lambinet|'''Lambinet Museum''']] in Versailles.  &quot;1684&quot; is mentioned on one of the bells (see the image).

In 1789, after the oath at the [[Tennis Court Oath|Royal tennis court]] (la Salle du Jeu de Paume),  the Third estate deputies who had been trying to join the clergies, demanded the monks to apply for asylum, but were refused.  They repeated the oath finally at [[Versailles Cathedral|Saint-Louis church]] (it hadn't been a cathedral yet at that time).

In 1793, the convent was transformed into prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In 1796, the building of the [[basilica]] which had been about to collapse, was finally demolished except the facade, for constructing a crossing between la rue St Julien (St Julien street) and la rue du Jeu de Paume (Jeu de Paume street). However, this project was never realized.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Since 19th century, it is always part of military domain.

In 1914, the 5th regiment of the engineers left here for [[World War II|the World War II]].

In 1985, the front portal of the basilica has been repaired keeping the original sculptures.

In 2001, its territory behind the building became a public park « '''le Jardin des Récollets''' » (Recollects park) inaugurated by [[Étienne Pinte|Etienne Pinte]], Deputy-Mayor of Versailles.  In 2013, the park was designed newly by '''Nicola Gilsoul''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nicolasgilsoul.com/index.php|title=Nicolas Gilsoul|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; architect and landscape architect, for the project of the city « l'''a Cour des Senteurs''' ».  Since then, it is called also as « J'''ardin des Senteurs''' »(Scent park).

== Construction ==
* The building of the convent is in quadrilateral.
* The [[colonnade]] is found at its South side, and surrounds the [[French formal garden]].
* A basilica with a [[nave]] had been found at North side of the [[French formal garden]], and was demolished in 1796. The site where it had been built was paved and conserved as a part of the courtyard.
* The North part of the convent marks the frontier of [[Cour des Senteurs|la Cour des Senteurs]] since 2013.
* The front portal of the basilica in la rue des Récollets (Recollects street) could receive the parishioners until the Revolution.  A [[pediment]] is found over the portal.
* The West part of the convent with the windows in la rue des Récollets continue up to the side entrance of la Cour des Senteurs.
* A  small service entrance is situated at the South side of the wall. 
* The ground behind the East part of the convent is opened as public park since 2001.

[[File:Signature of Michael Antoine Garoutte.png|thumb|Handwritten Signature of Michael Antoine Garoutte]]

'''Michael Antoine Garoutte''' Pronounced in French as: Mikel guh-roo (April 12, 1750 – April 29, 1829) was a member of the first [[nobility]] of [[Provence]] in the [[Kingdom of France]]. He was a [[Privateer]] in the early war for [[American Independence]] and ascended to the rank of [[Lieutenant]] in the first American [[Continental Navy]].

He was the first owner of the [[LaFayette Tavern]] in [[Pleasant Mills]], New Jersey, United States of America. &lt;ref&gt;Clerks Office of Gloucester County, New Jersey, United States. Tavern Licenses: Deed Book A3.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Iron in the Pines: The Story of New Jersey's Ghost Towns and Bog Iron, Page Number: 204&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The Wharton Ledgers, Volume: 14, Page Number: 344&lt;/ref&gt;

He belonged to a very old [[Provencal]] family of the nobility. He and his sister the Lady [[Marie Magdeleine Garoutte]] and her family were [[Revolutionaries]], they were among the first nobles to reform the French government in the [[French Revolution]]. Garoutte's favored nephew was French Revolutionary Army General [[Antoine Joseph Marie d'Espinassy]]. He was also one of the founding Catholics of [[Pennsylvania]]. &lt;ref&gt;Camden County Centennial, 1844 - 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

The street named Garoutte in [[Marseille]], France is named after his family.

Michel Antoine Garoutte's [[maternal]] grandfather was [[Baron]] Henri d'Lascour, who was the 1st cousin of [[Louis Capet]] the King of France. &lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire de la noblesse contenant les généalogies, l'histoire &amp; la chronologie des familles nobles de la France, l'explication de leurs armes et l'état des grandes terres du royaume, poffédées a̿ titre de principautés, duchés marquifats, comtés, vicomtés, baronies, &amp;c., par création héritages, alliances donations, substitions mutations, achats ou autrement par De La Chenaye-Desbois et Badier, Tome: 18, Volume: 18, Page: 957&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Garoutte was born April 12, 1750 in the castle Garoutte in [[Marseille]], Kingdom of France to the Lady Marie Anne d'Lascours and the Admiral, Sir Antoine Garoutte. He was baptized the following day at the oldest Catholic Parish of Marseille, the Notre-Dame Des Accoules Church. He was brought up in training and educated as a Catholic Priest, but at the age of 15 his older brother died in battle with no heirs and Garoutte exited seminary and went to [[Military School]], and later [[Officers School]] in Paris. He went to some of the same schools as his friend Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, the [[Marquis de LaFayette]]. He spent many months living in the Castle de la Jaconniere in [[Signes]] with the d'Espinassy Family after the death of his older brother.

After being pardoned in King [[Louis XVI]] court for dueling he sailed from [[Marseille]] commanding two ships to the [[New York Colony]] and fought in the War for [[American Independence]]. &lt;ref&gt;The French and American History of Michael Garoutte and His Descendants, 1775 - 1975, Third Edition, Page Number: XXXI. Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
Garoutte was in the [[Battle of Chestnut Neck]] where the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] burned down his ships in the [[Mullica River]]. His Privateer activities involved overtaking British Merchant vessels and British Navy vessels, taking the seized goods to [[Little Egg Harbor]] where the goods would be sent across the river through the [[Deleware]] and to [[Valley Forge]] to supply General [[George Washington]]'s military forces. He also secured artillery for the [[Patriot]] military forces.

Garoutte later served on the [[brig-of-war]] ''[[Enterprise (1776)|Enterprise]]'' and [[sloop-of-war]] ''[[Racehorse (ship)|Racehorse]]'' as a naval officer in the American Continental Navy.

Shortly after the Battle of Chestnut Neck Garoutte went to retrieve his friend who was hiding in an Inn and he was ambushed by 7 [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]]s, the Hessians stabbed Garoutte with a [[bayonet]] and blunted his head leaving him for dead on the dirt road. He was assisted by [[Quakers]] who were secretly aiding the American Revolutionaries, saving his life.

==Return to France==
Garoutte returned to the Kingdom of France arriving in 1787 where he was given gifts by the King [[Louis XVI]] and the Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], and again in January of 1793, his nephew was a member of the Council that decided Louis XVI's fate in the [[Trial of Louis XVI]].

On his return to the Kingdom of France in 1787 his sister wrote the following letter:

{{Quote|text=''Dear Sister-in-law:''

''I have seen with the greatest satisfaction my brother, your husband, after an absence of twelve years, without ever having heard from him. I assure you his arrival has given us the greatest pleasure, particularly so, as he informs me he has established himself and is so happy as to possess a respectable wife. I cannot think after all my brother has said, although he sets no bounds to the praises he gives you, yet I cannot help thinking he is inwardly chagrined, particularly when he speaks of his children. Can it be that my brother is not happy? Alas! He deserves to be for the natural goodness of his heart. Since he conceals his troubles from me, I address myself to you, madam, for to beg you to form me and shall be most happy if it is the means of removing them.''

''I will not conceal from you that your husband belongs to the first Nobility of Provence in France and, therefore, I beg you to be well persuaded of the sincere friendship with which I am for life, madam, dear Sister-in-law,''

''Your very humble servant,''

''Magdeleine Garoutte D'Espinassy''

''P.S. Have the goodness to embrace for me and my husband, your dear children, in waiting until I have the pleasure of taking in my arms little Nancy, whom my brother has promised me and I agree to educate, conformable to the education of her Father. My son, who is Captain of the Corps of Royal Artillery, now is Captain Francois, is ignorant that his uncle is with us but my daughter, who enjoys with me the pleasure of her uncle's company, embraces her little cousins, waiting with impatience to see little Nancy.''}}

==LaFayette Tavern==
Garoutte started a Tavern in Pleasant Mills, New Jersey and named it The LaFayette Tavern, undoubtedly after his childhood friend and school fellow the Marquis de LaFayette. [[Batsto]]-Pleasant Mills, New Jersey was a main manufacturer of guns for the military forces for [[American Independence]].

Garoutte's Tavern saw patrons the Corsican King of Spain [[Joseph Bonaparte]] and the [[Marquis de LaFayette]] among others. &lt;ref&gt;The French and American History of Michael Garoutte and His Descendants, 1775 - 1975, Third Edition, Page Number: XXXV. Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Sevier Family History Book, Page Number: 524&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine, Year: 1907, Volume: 31, Page Numbers: 588, 589&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Chronicle Telegram, Section: B-6, Sunday, July, 4, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; His tavern was well known in the day and was regarded as one of the best in New Jersey. [[Ebenezer Tucker]] was said to have complemented Garoutte on his ''Most pleasant inn''.

==Death==
Garoutte died April 29, 1829 at the age of 79 on the road in [[Pemberton]], New Jersey, United States of America determined to make his way back to France. He was buried in Pleasant Mills.

Garoutte mentioned in his journal that he was angry at John Sevier Jr for stealing his daughter Sophia Garoutte from him and he lost hope of ever seeing her again. He left the house of Governor [[John Sevier]] after Sevier took Garoutte's silver coins.

After he left he wrote the following entry in his journal:

{{Quote|text=''I left the house of the blacksmith and the Seviers, after they had served me with the greatest villainy in the world, and I am determined after my death to make them know their evil conduct, and on October 23rd I arrived at the home of my daughter Mary Earling, after 4 days of walking, because I had left without having a penny in my pocket.''}}

Garoutte then decided to sail back to France but he never made it.

[[File:4 chap1 img04 jehu.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Gustav Dore to accompany Alexandre Dumas' novel 'Les compagnons de Jehu']]
'''The Companions of Jehu''' were formed in the [[Lyon]] region of [[France]] in April 1795 to hunt down [[Jacobins]] implicated in the [[Reign of Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Baptiste Monfalcon, ''Histoire de la ville de Lyon'', Guilbert et Dorier, 1847 vol.II, page 1051)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Andress, ''The Terror'', Abacus 2005 p.361&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that they were originally founded by The Marquis de Besignan,&lt;ref&gt;http://shenandoahdavis.canalblog.com/archives/2013/02/23/26482023.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Ernest Daudet (1901) [http://www.nemausensis.com/Nimes/Revolution/ConspirateursDuMidi.pdf &quot;Conspirateurs du Midi sous la Révolution Française] ''La Revue du Midi'' pp. 361-375&lt;/ref&gt; who also founded royalist underground groups in [[Forez]] and [[Dauphiné]] with the [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé|Prince of Condé]] in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;http://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?lang=fr&amp;p=pierre+joseph&amp;n=duclaux+de+besignan&lt;/ref&gt;  Their victims are  believed to have numbered at least in the hundreds. They were made famous by the 1857 novel ''The Companions of Jehu'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]] which presented a highly romanticised account of them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7079&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the name==
[[Jehu]] was an Old Testament character,&lt;ref&gt;Emil G. Hirsch, M. Seligsohn (1906) [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8570-jehu &quot;Jehu&quot;] in ''The Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; immortalised in [[Jean Racine|Racine's]] drama ''[[Athalie]]''. He was famous for having killed [[Jezebel]] by throwing her out of a window. According to the [[Books of Kings]] Jezebel was responsible for inciting her husband King [[Ahab]] to abandon the worship of the true God and follow the cult of [[Baal]] instead. She also brought false testimony against [[Naboth]] and had him killed, and was the cause of much violence and bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;Emil G. Hirsch, Ira Maurice Price (1906) [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8675-jezebel &quot;Jezebel&quot;] in ''The Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, Jezebel represented the Jacobins of France, responsible for turning France away from the Catholic religion, bringing false testimony against patriotic citizens and executing them, and spreading violence and bloodshed through the Reign of Terror. By the same analogy, Jehu was the force of righteous retribution, come to restore the true religion, and kill Jezebel, her children and all those who had turned away from the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Nodier, ''Souvenirs et portraits de la Révolution'', Charpentier 1841 vol. VIII, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;  The reference to Jehu was not universally understood however, and through misunderstanding, uncertain repetition and assimilation with the broader idea of religious restoration, many people referred to ''the Companions of Jesus'' instead of ''the Companions of Jehu'', despite this name being essentially meaningless, as was pointed out by Louis Blanc.&lt;ref&gt;André Castelot, ''Présence de l’histoire'', 1969, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reference to their existence appears in the records of the [[National Convention]] in a report presented on 25 June 1795 from [[Marie-Joseph Chénier]] on the recent killings in Lyons.  His account says:

{{quote|&quot;An association of traitors has been organised at Lyon, banded together for the purpose of murder. This company, mixing together religious ideas with massacres, the call for royalism with words of justice and humanity, is known as the 'Companions of Jesus'. It is this company which is spreading a new terror in this commune, more vigorous and more widespread than [[Chalier]] and his bloody accomplices unleashed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Joseph Chénier &amp; Antoine-Vincent Arnault, 'Oevres de M Chénier', Guillaume, 1826 p.256&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Activities==
On 4 May 1795, 99 Jacobin prisoners were massacred in the town prisons by members of the companions. Over the following days the violence became more widespread and more murders took place as Jacobins were drowned, beaten to death and had their throats cut in their own homes or in the streets. The newspapers encouraged the murder of ''Terrorists'' and ''Drinkers of Blood'', and a list of people to be targeted, ninety pages long, was published in Lausanne and openly circulated. This phase of the [[First White Terror|White Terror]] continued until the army re-established control and various ringleaders were arrested and brought before the criminal court of [[Isère]]. The number of victims of the Companions of Jehu is impossible to know, because there is no reliable way of distinguishing between organised murders and more chaotic lynchings.

An order of 23 May 1796 by [[Louis Antoine Choin de Montgay|General Mointchoisy]] directed that &quot;to prevent the assassinations committed by the Companions of Jesus, it is forbidden to all citizens under any pretext whatsoever to carry swordsticks, throwing sticks, or batons weighted with lead or iron.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://shenandoahdavis.canalblog.com/archives/2013/02/23/26482023.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions over their existence==
Some historians, including [[Jacques Godechot]], have argued that the Companions of Jehu never actually existed. According to Lenotre,&lt;ref&gt;G.Lenotre, La compagnie de Jéhu: les vengeurs fantômes, Perrin, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; the [[French Directory|Directory]] sought to identify and punish royalists, emigres and refractory priests, and actively looked for people associated with the Companions of Jehu.  However although various criminals were arrested, none of them was a priest, emigre or royalist. All those arrested for murder and other serious crimes had been acting independently and there was no organised movement or any coordination between them. The tribunal, under Legris, concluded that there were no registers or membership lists for the Companions of Jehu.  Later, under [[Louis XVIII]], many royalists who had played very minor parts in resisting the revolution received pensions or decorations, but nobody ever came forward and claimed to have been a member of the Company of Jehu.

==Les Compagnies du Soleil==
While the Companions of Jehu were organised in and around Lyon, a similar group known as 'les Compagnies du Soleil' (The Companions of the Sun) formed and was active in [[Provence]] and [[Gard]]. The company's members considered it a sign of strength to carry the symbol of a splash of blood on their hands.&lt;ref&gt;John Paxton, ''Companion to the French Revolution'', Facts on File Books 1988 p.54&lt;/ref&gt; During the White Terror a group of Jacobins was able to take control of the city of [[Toulon]] from 17–23 May 1795,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of the French Revolution'', Longman 1989 p.479&lt;/ref&gt; and the Companions of the Sun were particularly associated with the repression and reprisals which took place after the army under General Pactod regained control of the city.

The '''''sans-culottes''''' ({{IPA-fr|sɑ̃kylɔt|lang}}, literally &quot;without [[culottes|breeches]]&quot;) were the common people of the lower classes in [[Early modern France#France in the 17th and 18th centuries|late 18th century France]], a great many of whom became radical and militant partisans of the [[French Revolution]] in response to their [[French Revolution#Causes|poor quality of life]] under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica2011sansculotte&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/522646/sansculotte ''Sansculotte'']. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 08 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''sans-culottes'' refers to their clothing, and through that to their lower-class status: ''[[culottes]]'' were the fashionable silk [[Breeches|knee-breeches]] of the 18th-century [[French nobility|nobility]] and [[Bourgeoisie#In France and French-speaking countries|bourgeoisie]], and the [[working class]] ''sans-culottes'' wore [[Trousers#Modern Europe|''pantalons'']], or trousers, instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911Sans&quot;&gt;Chisholm, Hugh (1911) ''Sans-culottes''. Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.) (Cambridge University Press, 1911). This saying meant &quot;ordinary patriots without fine clothes&quot;, and referred to the fancy clothes that famous patriots wore. They wore pants with cuffed, rolled up bottoms.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sans-culottes'', most of them urban labourers, served as the driving popular force behind the revolution. Though ill-clad and ill-equipped, they made up the bulk of the [[French Revolutionary Army|Revolutionary army]] during the early years of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].&lt;ref name=Soboul&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Sans-Culottes: The Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government, 1793–1794 |last=Soboul |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Soboul |year=1972 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-691-00782-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvxDQsze6r8C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0691007829&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-02-17 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1-22}}

The most fundamental political ideals of the ''sans-culottes'' were [[social equality]], [[Economic egalitarianism|economic equality]], and [[popular democracy]].

Translated by Harriet Applewhite, Mary Johnson. Pg 145. Quotation:&lt;blockquote&gt;They were also allied with the Enragés, the most extreme spokesmen on the left for the interests of the Parisian ''sans-culottes''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sans-culottes'' also populated the ranks of [[paramilitary]] forces charged with physically enforcing the policies and legislation of the revolutionary government, a task that not uncommonly included violence and the carrying out of executions against perceived enemies of the revolution.

During the peak of their influence, the ''sans-culottes'' were seen as the truest and most authentic sons and daughters of the French Revolution, held up as living representations of the revolutionary spirit. During the height of revolutionary fervor, such as during the [[Reign of Terror]] when it was dangerous to be associated with anything counter-revolutionary, even public functionaries and officials actually from middle or upper-class backgrounds adopted the clothing and label of the ''sans-culottes'' as a demonstration of solidarity with the working class and patriotism for the new [[French First Republic|French Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911Sans&quot;/&gt; 

But by early 1794, as the bourgeois and middle class elements of the revolution began to gain more political influence, the fervent working class [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] of the ''sans-culottes'' rapidly began falling out of favor within the National Convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911Sans&quot;/&gt; It wasn't long before [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] and his now dominant [[Jacobin Club]] turned against the radical factions of the National Convention, including the ''sans-culottes'', despite them having previously been the strongest supporters of the revolution and its government. Several important leaders of the Enragés and Hébertists were imprisoned and executed by the very [[Revolutionary Tribunal|revolutionary tribunals]] they had supported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911Sans&quot;/&gt; The execution of radical leader [[Jacques Hébert]] spelled the decline of the ''sans-culottes'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911Sans&quot;/&gt; and with the successive rise of even more conservative governments, the [[Thermidorian Convention]] and the [[French Directory]], they were definitively silenced as a political force.&lt;ref name=Soboul /&gt;{{rp|258-259}} After the defeat of the [[Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III|1795 popular revolt in Paris]], the ''sans-culottes'' ceased to play any effective political role in France until the [[July Revolution|July Revolution of 1830]].

==Legacy==
The popular image of the ''sans-culotte'' has gained currency as an enduring symbol for the passion, idealism and [[patriotism]] of the common man of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam2011sansculottism&quot;&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sansculottism ''Sansculottism'']. Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Merriam-Webster, 2011. Web. 17 Feb. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''sans-culottism''', ''sans-culottisme'' in French, refers to this idealized image and the themes associated with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam2011sansculottism&quot;/&gt; Many public figures and revolutionaries who were not strictly working class styled themselves ''citoyens sans-culottes'' in solidarity and recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911Sans&quot;/&gt; However, in the period immediately following the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] the ''sans-culottes'' and other [[left-wing politics|far-left]] [[political faction]]s were heavily persecuted and repressed by the likes of the [[Muscadin]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911Sans&quot;/&gt;

The [[French Republican Calendar]] at first termed the complementary days at the end of the year ''[[Sansculottides]]''; however, the [[National Convention]] suppressed the name when adopting the [[Constitution of the Year III]] (1795) and substituted the name ''jours complémentaires'' (&quot;additional days&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911Sans&quot;/&gt;

==Analysis==
According to Sally Waller, part of the ''sans-culottes'' mantra was &quot;permanent anticipation of betrayal and treachery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, Sally. &quot;How Significant was the Part Played by the Crowd and the Sans Culottes?&quot; France in Revolution, 1776–1830. Oxford: Heinemann, 2002. 162. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the ''sans-culottes'' were constantly on edge and fearing betrayal, which can be attributed to their violent and radical rebellion tactics.
Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] observes that the ''sans-culottes'' were a 'shapeless, mostly urban movement of the labouring poor, small craftsmen, shopkeepers, artisans, tiny entrepreneurs and the like'.&lt;ref name=&quot;hobsbawm1962theage&quot;&gt;Eric Hobsbawm 'The Age of Revolution' (St Ives, 1962; repr. 2008), p.84&lt;/ref&gt; He further notes they were organised notably in the local political clubs of Paris and &quot;provided the main striking-force of the revolution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hobsbawm1962theage&quot;/&gt; Hobsbawm writes that these were the actual demonstrators, rioters and constructors of street [[barricade]]s. However, Hobsbawm maintains, ''sans-culottism'' provided no real alternative to the bourgeois radicalism of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]];&lt;ref name=&quot;hobsbawm1962theage&quot;/&gt; from Hobsbawm's Marxist perspective, the ideal of the ''sans-culottes'', which sought to express the interests of the 'little men' who existed between the poles of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] and the [[proletariat|proletarian]], was contradictory and ultimately unrealizable.&lt;ref name=&quot;hobsbawm1962theage&quot;/&gt;

The Marxist historian [[Albert Soboul]] emphasized the importance of the ''sans-culottes'' as a social class, a sort of proto-proletariat that played a central role in the French Revolution. That view has been sharply attacked by scholars who say the ''sans-culottes'' were not a class at all. Indeed, as one historian points out, Soboul's concept has not been used by scholars in any other period of French history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R. Hanson|title=Contesting the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsCf8Q0xqO4C&amp;pg=PA95|date= 2009|publisher=John Wiley|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern colloquial usage==

The women's fashion industry commonly takes words that have historically been used to describe men's garments and uses them to describe an entirely different garment, often creating confusion among historians, history students, and readers. For example, currently, the term &quot;culottes&quot; in [[French language|French]] is now used to describe women's [[underpants]], an article of clothing that has little or no relation to the historic culottes.  The term ''&quot;sans-culottes&quot;'' has been used to refer colloquially to mean not wearing underpants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = sans-culotte | contribution-url = http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/sans-culotte | title = Passons de la sans-soutif de l'Upper East Side à la sans-culotte de Times Square | quote = And from no bra on the Upper East Side ... ... to no panties in Times Square.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
