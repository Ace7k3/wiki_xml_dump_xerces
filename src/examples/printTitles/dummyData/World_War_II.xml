      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="932">Historiography of the Second World War studies the processes by which historical knowledge about the war is obtained and transmitted. Broadly speaking, historiography examines the writing of [[military history]] and the use of [[historical method]]s, drawing upon such elements such as [[Academic authorship|authorship]], [[Research|sourcing]], [[Literary criticism|interpretation]], style, [[Conflict of interest|bias]], and audience. The word historiography can also refer to a body of historical work on a given area of research within the larger field of Second World War studies. As the tools of historical investigation have changed since the end of the war and influenced by their application in different participant states, the term itself bears multiple meanings and is not readily associated with a single all-encompassing definition.

[[File:Greater Germanic Reich.png|thumb|right|300px|Boundaries of the planned &quot;Greater Germanic Reich&quot; – including possible puppet states and protectorates – based on various, only partially systematized target projections (e.g. [[Generalplan Ost]]) from [[Nazi Germany|state administration]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leadership sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utopia: The 'Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation'|url=http://www.obersalzberg.de/utopie-grossgermanisches-reich.html?&amp;L=1|publisher=[[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]]|location=München - Berlin|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Greater Germanic Reich''' ({{lang-de|Großgermanisches Reich}}), fully styled the '''Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation''' ({{lang-de|Großgermanisches Reich Deutscher Nation}}) is the official state name of the political entity that [[Nazi Germany]] tried to establish in Europe during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;elvert1&quot;&gt;Elvert 1999, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Speer]] stated in [[Inside the Third Reich|his memoirs]] that Hitler also referred to the envisioned state as the '''[[Teutons|Teutonic]] Reich of the German Nation''', although it is unclear whether Speer was using the now seldom used &quot;[[German people|Teutonic]]&quot; as an English [[synonym]] for &quot;Germanic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Speer 1970, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler also mentions a future '''Germanic State of the German Nation''' ({{lang-de|Germanischer Staat Deutscher Nation}}) in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/innenpolitik/meinkampf/ DHM - Mein Kampf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The territorial claims for the Greater Germanic Reich vacillated over time. As early as the autumn of 1933, Hitler envisioned annexing such territories as [[Bohemia]], [[Western Poland]] and [[Austria]] to Germany and creation of [[satellite state|satellite]] or [[puppet state]]s without economies or policies of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Diemut | last = Majer | title = &quot;Non-Germans&quot; under the Third Reich: the Nazi judicial and administrative system in Germany and occupied Eastern Europe with special regard to occupied Poland, 1939—1945 | publisher=JHU Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8018-6493-3 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=w-IQu7nWQwQC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=poland+mitteleuropa | pages = 188–9 | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between gaining power and February 1939, Hitler tried to conceal his true intentions towards Poland and revealed them only to his closest associates; the signing of a non-aggression pact with Poland in 1934 was a political maneuver to conceal his true intentions towards Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Stutthof. Zeszyty Muzeum, 3. PL ISSN 0137-5377. Mirosław Gliński  Geneza obozu koncentracyjnego Stutthof na tle hitlerowskich przygotowan w Gdansku do wojny z Polsk&lt;/ref&gt; From 1934 to early 1939, Nazi Germany secretly prepared for war against Poland and mass murder and ethnic cleansing of its population, while officially claiming to the Polish government that it would continue to guarantee Poland's existence (though still maintaining its claims on the [[Polish Corridor]]) and offer Poland the right to annex the entirety of Ukraine from the Soviet Union, should Poland support Germany in a war with the Soviet Union, while Germany would annex the Baltic states and Soviet territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44&quot;&gt;Oscar Pinkus. ''The War Aims and Strategies of Adolf Hitler''. McFarland, 2005. P44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard L. Weinberg]]. ''Hitler's Foreign Policy 1933-1939: The Road to World War II''. Enigma Books, 2013. P152.&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst and for a short time after German–Soviet negotiations for the partition of Poland between Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] took place, Hitler did not include territorial designs on the Soviet Union within the Greater Germanic Reich from 1939 to 1941, and instead was focusing on uniting the Germanic peoples of [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Low Countries]] into the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich August Winkler]]. ''Germany, The Long Road West, 1933-1990''. Oxford, England, UK: Oxford University Press. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Pan-Germanism|pan-Germanic]] Empire was expected to [[Annexation|assimilate]] practically all of [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic Europe]] into an enormously expanded [[Reich]]. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged [[German Reich]] itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany proper, [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Eupen-Malmedy]], [[Klaipėda Region|Memel]], [[Lower Styria]], [[Upper Carniola]], [[Slovenian Carinthia|Southern Carinthia]] and [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|German-occupied Poland]]), the [[Netherlands]], the [[Flanders|Flemish]] part of [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], at least the [[German-speaking Switzerland|German-speaking]] parts of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich401402&quot;&gt;Rich 1974, pp. 401–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable exception was the [[United Kingdom]], which was not projected as having to be reduced to a German province but to instead become an [[Political alliance|allied]] seafaring partner of the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Strobl 2000, pp. 202–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Another exception was German-populated territory in [[South Tyrol]] that was part of allied [[Italy]]. Aside from Germanic Europe, the Reich's western frontiers with France were to be reverted to those of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire]], which would have meant the complete annexation of all of [[Wallonia]], [[Romandy|French Switzerland]], and large areas of northern and eastern France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2005, p. 209&quot;&gt;Williams 2005, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the policy of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' planned mass expansion of Germany eastwards to the [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;André Mineau. Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethics Against Human Dignity. Rodopi, 2004. P. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf Dieter Müller]], [[Gerd R. Ueberschär]]. ''[[Hitler's War in the East 1941−1945|Hitler's War in the East, 1941-1945]]: A Critical Assessment''. Berghahn Books, 2009. P. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler planned for the &quot;surplus&quot; Russian population living west of the Urals to be deported to the east of the Urals.&lt;ref&gt;Bradl Lightbody. ''The Second World War: Ambitions to Nemesis''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2004. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideological background==

===Racial theories===
{{Nazism sidebar}}
{{Further information|Master race}}
[[Nazi racial ideology]] regarded the [[Germanic peoples]] of Europe as belonging to a [[Racial supremacism|racially superior]] [[Nordic theory|Nordic]] subset of the larger [[Aryan race]], who were regarded as the only true culture-bearers of civilized society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohn&quot;&gt;Bohn 1997, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; These peoples were viewed as either &quot;true Germanic peoples&quot; that had &quot;lost their sense of racial pride&quot;, or as close racial relatives of the Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;wright2&quot;&gt;Wright 1968, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; German Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]] also believed that the [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were the racial ancestors of the Germans, and the first torchbearers of &quot;Nordic{{Ndash}}Greek&quot; art and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler 2000, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Housden 2000 , p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; He particularly expressed [[Laconophilia#Nazi Laconophilia|his admiration]] for [[Ancient Sparta]], declaring it to have been the purest racial state:&lt;ref&gt;Grafton et al 2010, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|&quot;The subjugation of 350,000 [[Helots]] by 6,000 Spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the Spartans.&quot; The Spartans had created &quot;the first racialist state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;un.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.un.org/holocaustremembrance/docs/paper3.shtml ''Hitler, Pol Pot, and Hutu Power: Distinguishing Themes of Genocidal Ideology''] Professor Ben Kiernan, Holocaust and the United Nations Discussion Paper&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, Hitler's concept of &quot;Germanic&quot; did not simply refer to an [[Ethnicity|ethnic]], [[Culture|cultural]], or [[linguistic group]], but also to a distinctly [[Scientific racism|biological one]], the superior &quot;Germanic blood&quot; that he wanted to salvage from the control of the enemies of the Aryan race. He stated that Germany possessed more of these &quot;Germanic elements&quot; than any other country in the world, which he estimated as &quot;four fifths of our people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler 2000, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Nazis, in addition to the Germanic peoples, individuals of seemingly non-Germanic nationality such as [[French people|French]], [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Walloons|Walloon]], [[Czech people|Czech]] and so on might actually possess valuable Germanic blood, especially if they were of [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] or [[peasant]] stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;fest685&quot;/&gt; In order to &quot;recover&quot; these &quot;missing&quot; Germanic elements, they had to be made conscious of their Germanic ancestry through the process of [[Germanization]] (the term used by the Nazis for this process was ''[[Umvolkung]]'', &quot;restoration to the race&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;fest685&quot;/&gt; If the &quot;recovery&quot; was impossible, these individuals had to be destroyed to deny the enemy of using their superior blood against the Aryan race.&lt;ref name=&quot;fest685&quot;/&gt; An example of this type of Nazi Germanization is the [[Kidnapping of Eastern European children by Nazi Germany|kidnapping of &quot;racially valuable&quot; Eastern European children]].

On the very first page of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler openly declared his belief that &quot;common blood belongs in a common Reich&quot;, elucidating the notion that the innate quality of [[race (classification of humans)|race]] (as the Nazi movement perceived it) should hold precedence over &quot;artificial&quot; concepts such as [[Nationalism|national identity]] (including regional German identities such as [[Prussia]]n and [[Bavaria]]n) as the deciding factor for which people were &quot;worthy&quot; of being assimilated into a Greater German [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racial state]] (''Ein [[Volk]], Ein [[Reich]], Ein [[Führer]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Hitler 1927, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the strategic methods which Hitler chose to ensure the present and future supremacy of the Aryan race (which was, according to Hitler, &quot;gradually approaching extinction&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fest 1973, p. 210&quot;&gt;Fest 1973, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;) was to do away with what he described as the &quot;small state rubbish&quot; (''Kleinstaatengerümpel'', compare ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'') in Europe in order to unite all these Nordic countries into one unified racial community.&lt;ref&gt;Fink 1985, pp. 27, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 onward he advocated the creation of a &quot;Germanic Reich of the German Nation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;elvert1&quot;/&gt;

{{blockquote|It was [[Continental Europe|the continent]] which brought civilization to Great Britain and in turn enabled her to colonize large areas in the rest of the world.

===Name===
{{Further information|Reich}}
The chosen name for the projected empire was a deliberate reference to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (of the German Nation) that existed in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times, known as the ''First Reich'' in National Socialist historiography.&lt;ref name=&quot;hattstein&quot;&gt;Hattstein 2006, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Different aspects of the legacy of this medieval empire in German history were both celebrated and derided by the National Socialist government.  Hitler admired the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] for his &quot;cultural creativity&quot;, his powers of organization, and his renunciation of the [[Individual liberty|rights of the individual]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hattstein&quot;/&gt; He criticized the Holy Roman Emperors however for not pursuing an ''Ostpolitik'' ([[Drang Nach Osten|Eastern Policy]]) resembling his own, while being politically focused exclusively on [[Italy|the south]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hattstein&quot;/&gt;  After the ''Anschluss'', Hitler ordered the old [[Austrian Crown Jewels#The Holy Roman Empire|imperial regalia]] (the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Crown]], [[Imperial Sword]], [[Cross of Lothair]], [[Spear of Destiny#Vienna Lance .28Hofburg spear.29|the Holy Lance]] and other items) residing in [[Vienna]] to be transferred to [[Nuremberg]], where they were kept between 1424 and 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hamann | first1 = Brigitte | authorlink1 = Brigitte Hamann | title = Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | others = Trans. Thomas Thornton | isbn = 978-0-19-512537-5 | page= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuremberg, in addition to being the former unofficial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, was also the place of the [[Nuremberg rallies]]. The transfer of the regalia was thus done to both legitimize Hitler's Germany as the successor of the &quot;Old Reich&quot;, but also weaken Vienna, the former imperial residence.&lt;ref&gt;Haman 1999, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|1939 German occupation of Bohemia]], Hitler declared that the HRE had been &quot;resurrected&quot;, although he secretly maintained his own empire to be better than the old &quot;Roman&quot; one.&lt;ref name=&quot;brockmann&quot;&gt;Brockmann 2006, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the &quot;uncomfortably [[Multinational state|internationalist]] Catholic empire of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]&quot;, the Germanic Reich of the German Nation would be [[racist]] and [[nationalist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brockmann&quot;/&gt; Rather than a return to the values of the Middle Ages, its establishment was to be &quot;[[Progress (history)|a push forward]] to a new [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]], in which the best aspects of the past would be combined with modern racist and nationalist thinking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;brockmann&quot;/&gt;

The historical borders of the Holy Empire were also used as grounds for territorial revisionism by the NSDAP, laying claim to modern territories and states that were once part of it. Even before the war, Hitler had dreamed of reversing the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which had given the territories of the Empire almost complete sovereignty.&lt;ref name=&quot;winkler&quot;/&gt; On November 17, 1939, [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] wrote in [[Goebbels Diaries|his diary]] that the &quot;total liquidation&quot; of this historic treaty was the &quot;great goal&quot; of the Nazi regime,&lt;ref name=&quot;winkler&quot;/&gt; and that since it had been signed in [[Münster]], it would also be officially repealed in the same city.&lt;ref&gt;Goebbels, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan-Germanism versus Pan-Germanicism===
{{Further information|Pan-Germanism}}
Despite intending to accord the other &quot;Germanics&quot; of Europe a racially superior status alongside the [[Germans]] themselves in an anticipated post-war racio-political order, the Nazis did not however consider granting the subject populations of these countries any national rights of their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohn&quot;/&gt; The other Germanic countries were seen as mere extensions of Germany rather than individual units in any way,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohn&quot;/&gt; and the Germans were unequivocally intended to remain the empire's &quot;most powerful source of strength, from both an ideological as well as military standpoint&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Table&quot;&gt;Hitler 2000, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Heinrich Himmler]], who among the senior Nazis most staunchly supported the concept, could not shake off the idea of a hierarchical distinction between German ''[[Volk]]'' and Germanic ''Völker''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wright1&quot;&gt;Wright 1968, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'s official newspaper, ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'', never succeeded in reconciling the contradiction between Germanic 'brotherhood' and German superiority.&lt;ref name=&quot;wright1&quot;/&gt; Members of Nazi-type parties in Germanic countries were also forbidden to attend public meetings of the [[Nazi Party]] when they visited Germany. After the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] this ban was lifted, but only if the attendees made prior notice of their arrival so that the events' speakers could be warned in advance not to make disparaging remarks about their country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell 2005, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hitler himself and Himmler's SS advocated for a pan-Germanic Empire, the objective was not universally held in the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;lipgens&quot;&gt;Lipgens 1985, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Goebbels and the [[Reich Foreign Ministry]] under [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] inclined more towards an idea of a continental bloc under German rule, as represented by the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], Ribbentrop's &quot;[[European Confederation]]&quot; project and the earlier ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' concept.

===Germanic mysticism===
{{Further information|Religious aspects of Nazism}}
There were also disagreements within the NSDAP leadership on the spiritual implications of cultivating a 'Germanic history' in their ideological program. Hitler was highly critical of Himmler's [[esoteric]] [[Völkisch movement|völkisch]] interpretation of the 'Germanic mission'. When Himmler denounced [[Charlemagne]] in a speech as &quot;the butcher of the [[Saxons]]&quot;, Hitler stated that this was not a 'historical crime' but in fact a good thing, for the subjugation of [[Widukind]] had brought [[Western culture]] into what eventually became [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;speer2&quot;&gt;Speer 1970, pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; He also disapproved of the [[pseudoarchaeological]] projects which Himmler organized through his [[Ahnenerbe]] organization, such as excavations of pre-historic Germanic sites:

{{blockquote|Why do we call the whole world's attention to the fact that we have no past? It isn't enough that [[Ancient Rome|the Romans]] were erecting great buildings when our forefathers were still living in mud huts; now Himmler is starting to dig up these villages of mud huts and enthusing over every potsherd and stone axe he finds. All we prove by that is that we were still throwing stone hatchets and crouching around open fires when [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and Rome had already reached the highest stage of culture. We really should do our best to keep quiet about this past. Instead Himmler makes a great fuss about it all. The [[Italians|present-day Romans]] must be having a laugh at these relegations.|Adolf Hitler|&lt;ref name=&quot;speer2&quot;/&gt;}}

In an attempt to eventually supplant [[Christianity]] with a religion more amenable to National Socialist ideology, Himmler, together with [[Alfred Rosenberg]], sought to replace it with [[Germanic paganism]] (the indigenous traditional religion or ''Volksreligion'' of the Germanic peoples), of which the Japanese [[Shinto]] was seen as an almost perfect East Asian counterpart.&lt;ref name=&quot;dom1&quot;&gt;Domarus 2007, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose they had ordered the construction of sites for the worship of Germanic cults in order to exchange [[Christian sacraments|Christian rituals]] for Germanic [[consecration]] ceremonies, which included different marriage and [[burial]] rites.&lt;ref name=&quot;dom1&quot;/&gt; In Heinrich Heims' ''Adolf Hitler, Monologe im FHQ 1941-1944'' (several editions, here Orbis Verlag, 2000), Hitler is quoted as having said on 14 October 1941: &quot;It seems to be inexpressibly stupid to allow a revival of the cult of Odin/Wotan. Our old mythology of the gods was defunct, and incapable of revival, when Christianity came...the whole world of antiquity either followed [[Ancient philosophy|philosophical systems]] on the one hand, or [[Paganism|worshipped the gods]]. But in modern times it is undesirable that all humanity should make such a fool of itself.&quot;

==Establishment strategy==
The goal was first proclaimed publicly in the 1937 [[Nuremberg Rallies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;speer1&quot;&gt;Speer 1970, pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's last speech at this event ended with the words &quot;The German nation has after all acquired its Germanic Reich&quot;, which elicited speculation in political circles of a 'new era' in Germany's [[foreign policy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;speer1&quot;/&gt; Several days before the event Hitler took [[Albert Speer]] aside when both were on their way to the former's Munich apartment with an entourage, and declared to him that &quot;We will create a great empire. All the Germanic peoples will be included in it. It will begin in Norway and extend to [[northern Italy]].&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;This passage should in all likelihood be interpreted to mean &quot;extending ''up to'' northern Italy&quot;, not that it would also include this region. There is no convincing evidence that Hitler intended to include any Italian provinces in the German state before 1943, including [[South Tyrol]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; I myself must carry this out. If only I keep [[Adolf Hitler's health|my health]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;speer1&quot;/&gt; On April 9, 1940, as Germany invaded Denmark and Norway in [[Operation Weserübung]], Hitler announced the establishment of the Germanic Reich:

{{blockquote|Just as the [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] [[German Empire|Empire]] arose from the year 1866, so too will the Greater Germanic Empire arise from this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;winkler&quot;&gt;Sager &amp; Winkler 2007, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The establishment of the empire was to follow the model of the [[Austria]]n ''[[Anschluss]]'' of 1938, just carried out on a greater scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;welch&quot;&gt;Welch 1983, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Goebbels emphasized in April 1940 that the annexed Germanic countries would have to undergo a similar &quot;national revolution&quot; as Germany herself did after the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'', with an enforced rapid social and political &quot;co-ordination&quot; in accordance with Nazi principles and ideology (''[[Gleichschaltung]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;welch&quot;/&gt;

The ultimate goal of the ''Gleichschaltung'' policy pursued in these parts of occupied Europe was to destroy the very concepts of individual states and nationalities, just as the concept of a separate Austrian state and [[Austrians|national identity]] was repressed after the ''Anschluss'' through the establishment of [[Ostmark (Austria)|new state and party districts]].&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, pp. 24–25, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The new empire was to no longer be a [[nation-state]] of the type that had emerged in the 19th century, but instead a &quot;racially pure community&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;winkler&quot;/&gt; It is for this reason that the German occupiers had no interest in transferring real power to the various far-right [[nationalist]] movements present in the occupied countries (such as [[Nasjonal Samling]], the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]], etc.) except for temporary reasons of ''[[Realpolitik]]'', and instead actively supported radical [[Collaboration during World War II|collaborators]] who favored pan-Germanic unity (i.e. total integration to Germany) over [[Provincialism|provincial]] nationalism (for example [[DeVlag]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;warmbrunn&quot;&gt;See e.g. Warmbrunn 1963, pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Austria and the [[Sudetenland]] however, the process was to take considerably longer.&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually these nationalities were to be merged with the Germans into a single ruling race, but Hitler stated that this prospect lay &quot;a hundred or so years&quot; in the future. During this interim period it was intended that the 'New Europe' would by run by Germans alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;wright1&quot;/&gt; According to Speer, while Himmler intended to eventually [[Germanization|Germanize]] these peoples completely, Hitler intended not to &quot;infringe on their individuality&quot; (that is, [[Germanic languages|their native languages]]), so that in the future they would &quot;add to the diversity and dynamism&quot; of his empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;speer3&quot;&gt;Speer 1976, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German language]] would be its [[lingua franca]] however, likening it to the status of [[English language|English]] in the [[British Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;speer3&quot;/&gt;

A primary agent used in stifling the local extreme nationalist elements was the [[Germanic SS]], which initially merely consisted of local respective branches of the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]'' in [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bramstedt&quot;&gt;Bramstedt 2003, pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups were at first under the authority of their respective pro-National Socialist national commanders ([[Staf De Clercq|De Clercq]], [[Anton Mussert|Mussert]] and [[Vidkun Quisling|Quisling]]), and were intended to function within their own national territories only.&lt;ref name=&quot;bramstedt&quot;/&gt; During the course of 1942, however, the Germanic SS was further transformed into a tool used by Himmler against the influence of the less extreme collaborating parties and their [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-style organizations, such as the ''[[Hird (Nazi)|Hird]]'' in Norway and the ''Weerbaarheidsafdeling'' in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;bramstedt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kroener&quot;&gt;Kroener, Müller &amp; Umbreit 2003, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war Germanic Empire, these men were to form the new leadership cadre of their respective national territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;morgan&quot;&gt;Morgan 2003, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasize their pan-Germanic ideology, the ''Norges SS'' was now renamed the ''Germanske SS Norge'', the ''Nederlandsche SS'' the ''[[Germaansche SS in Nederland]]'' and the ''Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen'' the ''[[Germaansche SS in Vlaanderen]]''. The men of these groups no longer swore allegiance to their respective national leaders, but to the ''germanischer Führer'' (&quot;Germanic [[Führer]]&quot;), Adolf Hitler:&lt;ref name=&quot;bramstedt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kroener&quot;/&gt;

{{blockquote|I swear to you, Adolf Hitler, as Germanic Führer loyalty and bravery. I pledge you and the superiors which you appointed obedience until death. So help me God.&lt;ref name=&quot;jong1&quot;&gt;De Jong 1974, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This title was assumed by Hitler on 23 June 1941, at the suggestion of Himmler.&lt;ref name=&quot;jong1&quot;/&gt; On 12 December 1941 the Dutch right-wing nationalist [[Anton Mussert]] also addressed him in this fashion when he proclaimed his allegiance to Hitler during a visit to the [[Reich Chancellery]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;jong2&quot;&gt;De Jong 1974, pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; He had wanted to address Hitler as ''Führer aller Germanen'' (&quot;Führer of all Germanics&quot;), but Hitler personally decreed the former style.&lt;ref name=&quot;jong1&quot;/&gt; Historian [[Loe de Jong]] speculates on the difference between the two: ''Führer aller Germanen'' implied a position separate from Hitler's role as ''Führer und Reichskanzler des Grossdeutschen Reiches'' (&quot;Führer and [[Chancellor of Germany|Reich Chancellor]] of the Greater German Reich&quot;), while ''germanischer Führer'' served more as an attribute of that main function.&lt;ref name=&quot;jong2&quot;/&gt; As late as 1944 occasional propaganda publications continued to refer to him by this unofficial title as well however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasufali.nl/titel-a/adolf.htm ''Adolf Hitler: Führer aller Germanen'']. Storm, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussert held that Hitler was predestined to become the Führer of Germanics because of his congruous personal history: Hitler originally was an Austrian national, who enlisted in the [[Bavarian army]] and lost his Austrian citizenship. He thus remained [[Statelessness|stateless]] for seven years, during which, according to Mussert, he was &quot;the Germanic leader and nothing else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lipgens 1985, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swastika flag|Swastika Flag]] was to be used as a symbol to represent not only the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist movement]], but also the unity of the Nordic-Germanic peoples into a single state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich4&quot;&gt;Rich 1974, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[swastika]] was seen by many National Socialists as a fundamentally Germanic and European symbol despite its presence among many cultures worldwide.

Hitler had long intended to [[Welthauptstadt Germania|architecturally reconstruct]] the German capital [[Berlin]] into a new imperial metropolis, which he decided in 1942 to rename ''Germania'' upon its scheduled completion in 1950. The name was specifically chosen to make it the clear central point of the envisioned Germanic empire, and to re-enforce the notion of a united Germanic-Nordic state upon the Germanic peoples of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitler 400&quot;&gt;Hitler 2000, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Just as the [[Bavaria]]ns and the [[Prussia]]ns had to be impressed by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] of the [[Unification of Germany|German idea]], so too must the [[Germanic peoples]] of continental Europe be steered towards the Germanic concept. He [Hitler] even considers it good that by renaming the Reich capital Berlin into 'Germania', we'll have given considerable driving force to this task. The name Germania for the Reich capital would be very appropriate, for in spite of how far removed those belonging to the Germanic racial core will be, this capital will instill a sense of unity.|Adolf Hitler|&lt;ref&gt;Hillgruber &amp; Picker, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Rquote|right|For him [Hitler] it is self-evident [''eine Selbstverständlichkeit''] that Belgium and Flanders and Brabant will likewise be turned into German Reichsgaue (provinces). The Netherlands will also not be allowed to lead a politically independent life... Whether the Dutch offer any resistance to this or not, is fairly irrelevant.|Joseph Goebbels|&lt;ref&gt;Unpublished fragment from [[Goebbels diaries|Joseph Goebbels' diaries]], located in the collection of the [[Hoover Institution|Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace]], Palo Alto, California.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The German plans of annexation were more advanced for the [[Low Countries]] than for the [[Nordic States|Nordic states]], due in part because of their closer geographical proximity as well as cultural and ethnic ties to Germany. [[Luxembourg]] and [[Belgium]] were both formally annexed into the German Reich during World War II, in 1942 and 1944 respectively, the latter as the new ''[[Reichsgau]]e'' of [[Reichsgau Flandern|Flandern]] and [[Reichsgau Wallonien|Wallonien]] (the proposed third one, [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], was not implemented in this arrangement) and a [[District of Brussels|Brussels District]]. On April 5, 1942, while having dinner with an entourage including Heinrich Himmler, Hitler declared his intention that the Low Countries would be included whole into the Reich, at which point the ''Greater German Reich'' would be reformed into the ''Germanic Reich'' (simply &quot;the Reich&quot; in common parlance) to signify this change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Table&quot;/&gt;

In October 1940 Hitler disclosed to [[Benito Mussolini]] that he intended to leave the [[Netherlands]] semi-independent because he wanted that country to retain [[Dutch colonial empire|its overseas colonial empire]] after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;rich1&quot;&gt;Rich 1974, p. 469, note 110.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor was removed after the Japanese took over the [[Netherlands East Indies]], the primary component of that domain.&lt;ref name=&quot;rich1&quot;/&gt; The resulting German plans for the Netherlands suggested its transformation into a ''[[Gau Westland]]'', which would eventually be further broken-up into five new ''[[Gaue]]'' or ''gewesten'' (historical Dutch term for a type of sub-national [[polity]]). [[Fritz Schmidt (Generalkommissar)|Fritz Schmidt]], a ranking German official in the occupied Netherlands who hoped to become the [[Gauleiter]] of this new province on Germany's western periphery stated that it could even be called ''Gau Holland'', as long as the [[Wilhelmus]] (the Dutch [[national anthem]]) and similar [[patriotic]] symbols were to be forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;De Jong 1969, Vol. 1, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotterdam]], which had actually been [[Rotterdam Blitz|largely destroyed]] in the course of the [[Battle of the Netherlands|1940 invasion]] was to be rebuilt as the most important port-city in the &quot;Germanic area&quot; due to its situation at the mouth of the [[Rhine river]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fest&quot;&gt;Fest 1973, p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt;

Himmler's personal masseur [[Felix Kersten]] claimed that the former even contemplated [[Forced resettlement|resettling]] the entire [[Dutch people|Dutch population]], some 8 million people in total at the time, to agricultural lands in the [[Vistula]] and [[Bug River]] valleys of [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German-occupied Poland]] as the most efficient way of facilitating their immediate Germanization.&lt;ref&gt;Waller 2002, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In this eventuality he is alleged to have further hoped to establish an ''SS Province of Holland'' in vacated Dutch territory, and to distribute all confiscated Dutch property and real estate among reliable SS-men.&lt;ref&gt;Kersten 1947, pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; However this claim was shown to be a myth by [[Loe de Jong]] in his book ''Two Legends of the Third Reich''.&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Jong, 1972, reprinted in German translation: H-H. Wilhelm and L. de Jong. Zwei Legenden aus dem dritten Reich : quellenkritische Studien, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt 1974, pp 79-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position in the future empire of the [[Frisians]], another Germanic people, was discussed on 5 April 1942 in one of [[Hitler's Table Talk|Hitler’s many wartime dinner-conversations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Table&quot;/&gt; Himmler commented that there was ostensibly no real sense of community between the different indigenous ethnic groups in the Netherlands. He then stated that the [[Friesland|Dutch Frisians]] in particular seemed to hold no affection for being part of a [[nation-state]] based on the [[Dutch people|Dutch national identity]], and felt a much greater sense of kinship with their German Frisian brethren across the [[Ems (river)|Ems River]] in [[East Frisia]], an observation Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] agreed with based on his own experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Table&quot;/&gt; Hitler determined that the best course of action in that case would be to unite the two Frisian regions on both sides of the border into a single province, and would at a later point in time further discuss the topic with [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], the [[Reichskommissar|governor]] of the [[Reichskommissariat Niederlande|German regime]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Table&quot;/&gt; By late May of that year these discussions were apparently concluded, as on the 29th he pledged that he would not allow the [[West Friesland (historical region)|West-Frisians]] to remain part of Holland, and that since they were &quot;part of the exact same race as the people of East Frisia&quot; had to be joined into one province.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler (2000), 29th of May 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler considered [[Wallonia]] to be &quot;in reality German lands&quot; which were gradually detached from the [[German-speaking Europe|Germanic territories]] by the French [[Romanization]] of the [[Walloons]], and that Germany thus had &quot;every right&quot; to take these back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2005, p. 209&quot;/&gt; Before the decision was made to include Wallonia in its entirety, several smaller areas straddling the traditional [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-[[Romance languages|Romance]] language border in Western Europe were already considered for inclusion. These included the small [[Luxembourgish|Lëtzebuergesh]]-speaking area centred on [[Arlon]],&lt;ref&gt;Gildea, Wieviorka &amp; Warring 2006, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Low Dietsch]]-speaking region west of [[Eupen]] (the so-called ''Platdietse Streek'') around the city of [[Limbourg]], historical capital of the [[Duchy of Limburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamacher, Hertz &amp; Keenan 1989, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

After their invasion in [[Operation Weserübung]], Hitler vowed that he would never again leave Norway,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fest&quot;/&gt; and favored annexing [[Denmark]] as a German province even more due to its small size and relative closeness to Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roth&quot;&gt;Rothwell 2005, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler's hopes were an expansion of the project so that [[Iceland]] would also be included among the group of Germanic countries which would have to be gradually incorporated into the Reich.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roth&quot;/&gt; He was also among the group of more esoteric National Socialists who believed either Iceland or [[Greenland]] to be the mystical land of [[Thule]], a purported original homeland of the ancient [[Aryan race]].&lt;ref&gt;Janssens 2005, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; From a military point of view, the Kriegsmarine command hoped to see the [[Spitsbergen]], Iceland, Greenland, the [[Faroe Isles]] and possibly the [[Shetland Isles]] (which were also claimed by the [[Quisling regime]]&lt;ref&gt;Philip H.

There was preparation for the construction of a new German metropolis of 300.000 inhabitants called ''[[Nordstern]]'' (&quot;[[North Star]]&quot;) next to the Norwegian city of [[Trondheim]]. It would be accompanied by a new naval base that was intended to be the Germany's largest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fest&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 2006, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; This city was to be connected to Germany proper by an [[German Autobahnen#History|Autobahn]] across the [[Little Belt|Little]] and [[Great Belt]]s. It would also house an [[art museum]] for the northern part of the Germanic empire, housing &quot;only works of [[German art]]ists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 2005, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweden]]'s future subordination into the '[[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]]' was considered by the regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;leitz52&quot;&gt;Leitz 2000, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler stated that the Swedes were the &quot;epitome of the Nordic spirit and the Nordic man&quot;, and looked forward to incorporating central and [[Skåne|southern Sweden]] to the Germanic Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;leitz52&quot;/&gt; Himmler offered northern Sweden, with its [[Tornedalians|Finnish minority]], to [[Finland]], along with the Norwegian port of [[Kirkenes]], although this suggestion was rejected by [[Foreign Ministry of Finland|Finnish Foreign Minister]] [[Rolf Witting|Witting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ackermann&quot;&gt;Ackermann 1970, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kersten1957&quot;&gt;Kersten 1957, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Felix Kersten]], claimed that Himmler had expressed regret that Germany had not occupied Sweden during Operation Weserübung, but was certain that this error was to be rectified after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1942, Goebbels expressed similar views in his diary, writing that Germany should have occupied the country during its campaign in the north, as &quot;this state has no right to national existence anyway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FhEFAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22no+right+to+national+existence%22&amp;dq=%22no+right+to+national+existence%22&amp;hl=fi&amp;ei=y8HHTZyQEoyA-waGndXSAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCA The Goebbels diaries, 1942-1943, p.171.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, [[Hermann Göring]] suggested that Sweden's future position in the Reich was similar to that of [[Bavaria]] in the German Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;leitz52&quot;/&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2012}} The ethnically Swedish [[Åland Islands]], which [[Åland crisis|were awarded]] to Finland by the [[League of Nations]] in 1921, were likely to join Sweden in the Germanic Empire. In the spring of 1941, the German [[military attaché]] in [[Helsinki]] reported to his Swedish counterpart that Germany would need [[Sweden during World War II#Midsummer Crisis|transit rights]] through Sweden for the imminent invasion of the Soviet Union, and in the case of finding her cooperative would permit the Swedish annexation of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 2004, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler did veto the idea of a [[Sweden-Finland|complete union]] between the two states of Sweden and Finland, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich3&quot;/&gt;

Despite the majority of its people being of [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] origin, Finland was given the status of being an &quot;[[Honorary Aryan#&quot;Honorary Nordic&quot;|honorary Nordic nation]]&quot; (from a [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|National Socialist racial]] perspective, not a [[Nordic countries|national one]]) by Hitler as reward for its military importance in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|ongoing conflict]] against the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich3&quot;&gt;Rich 1974, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking minority]] of the country, who in 1941 comprised 9.6% of the total population, were considered Nordic and were initially preferred over [[Finns|Finnish speakers]] in recruitment for the [[Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=19 |title= Finnish Volunteers in the Wehrmacht in WWII |first1=Jarto |last1= Nieme |first2=Jason |last2= Pipes |date= |work=Feldgrau |publisher= |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland's Nordic status did not mean however that it was intended to be absorbed into the Germanic Empire, but instead expected to become the guardian of Germany’s [[Northern Europe|northern]] [[Flanking maneuver#Strategic flanking|flank]] against the hostile remnants of a conquered USSR by attaining control over [[Karelia]]n territory, [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia, 1941-1944|occupied by the Finns]] in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich3&quot;/&gt; Hitler also considered the [[Climate of Finland|Finnish and Karelian climates]] unsuitable for German colonization.&lt;ref name=&quot;boog922&quot;&gt;Boog 2001, p. 922.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the possibility of Finland's eventual inclusion as a [[Territorial autonomy|federated state]] in the empire as a long-term objective was mulled over by Hitler in 1941, but by 1942 he seems to have abandoned this line of thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;boog922&quot;/&gt; According to Kersten, as Finland signed [[Moscow Armistice|an armistice]] with the Soviet Union and broke off diplomatic relations with her former [[Co-belligerence|brother-in-arms]] Germany in September 1944, Himmler felt remorse for not eliminating the Finnish state, government and its &quot;[[Freemasonry|masonic]]&quot; [[Risto Ryti|leadership]] sooner, and transforming the country into a &quot;National Socialist Finland with a Germanic outlook&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kersten 1947, pp. 131, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{Further information|Operation Tannenbaum}}

The same implicit hostility toward [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral nations]] such as Sweden was also held towards [[Switzerland]]. Goebbels noted in his diary on December 18, 1941, that &quot;It would be a veritable insult to [[God]] if they [the neutrals] would not only survive [[World War II|this war]] unscathed while the [[Participants in World War II|major powers]] make such great sacrifices, but also profit from it. We will certainly make sure that this will not happen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Urner 2002, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss people]] were seen by Nazi ideologists as a mere offshoot of the German nation, although one led astray by [[Decadence|decadent]] [[Western culture|Western ideals]] of [[democracy]] and [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook 1998, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler decried the Swiss as &quot;a misbegotten branch of our ''[[Volk]]''&quot; and the Swiss state as &quot;a pimple on the face of Europe&quot; deeming them unsuitable for settling the territories that the Nazis expected to colonize in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitler 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Himmler discussed plans with his subordinates to integrate at least the [[Swiss German|German-speaking]] parts of Switzerland completely with the rest of Germany, and had several persons in mind for the post of a [[Reichskommissar]] for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in analogy to the office that [[Josef Bürckel]] held after [[Austria]]'s absorption into Germany during the ''[[Anschluss]]''). Later this official was to subsequently become the new [[Reichsstatthalter]] of the area after completing its total assimilation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich401402&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fink 1985, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1940, [[Gauleiter]] of [[Westfalen]]-South [[Josef Wagner (Gauleiter)|Josef Wagner]] and the Minister President of [[Baden]] [[Walter Köhler]] spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to ''Reichsgau Burgund'' (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant ''[[Palais des Nations]]'' in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans Rudolf Fuhrer |title=Spionage gegen die Schweiz|publisher=Huber|location= |year=1982|page=68|isbn=3-274-00003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Tannenbaum]], a military offensive intended to occupy all of Switzerland, most likely in co-operation with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] (which itself desired the [[Swiss Italian|Italian-speaking]] areas of Switzerland), was in the planning stages during 1940-1941. Its implementation was seriously considered by the German military after the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice with France]], but it was definitively shelved after the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] had directed the attention of the [[Wehrmacht]] elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook 1998, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Munich Agreement]], Hitler and French Prime Minister [[Édouard Daladier]] in December 1938 made an agreement that officially declared that Germany was relinquishing its previous territorial claims on [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in the interest of maintaining peaceful relations between France and Germany and both pledged to be involved in mutual consultation on matters involving the interests of both countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nazi Foreign Policy Pp. 58&quot;&gt;Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933–1941: The Road to Global War. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; However at the same time Hitler in private advised the High Command of the Wehrmacht to prepare operational plans for a joint German–Italian war against France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nazi Foreign Policy Pp. 58&quot;/&gt;

Under the auspices of [[State Secretary]] [[Wilhelm Stuckart]] the [[Reich Interior Ministry]] produced an initial memo for the planned annexation of a strip of eastern France in June 1940, stretching from the mouth of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]] to [[Lake Geneva]],&lt;ref name=&quot;schottler&quot;&gt;Schöttler 2003, pp. 83–131.&lt;/ref&gt; and on July 10, 1940, Himmler toured the region to inspect its Germanization potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;winkler&quot;/&gt; According to documents produced in December 1940, the annexed territory would consist of nine [[French department]]s, and the Germanization action would require the settlement of a million Germans from &quot;[[peasant]] families&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;winkler&quot;/&gt; Himmler decided that [[South Tyrol]]ean emigrants (see [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]]) would be used as settlers, and the towns of the region would receive South Tyrolean place-names such as Bozen, [[Brixen]], [[Meran]], and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Steininger 2003, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942 Hitler had, however, decided that the South Tyroleans would be instead used to settle the [[Crimea]], and Himmler regretfully noted &quot;For [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], we will just have to find another [Germanic] ethnic group.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler claimed French territory even beyond the historical border of the Holy Roman Empire. He stated that in order to ensure German hegemony on the continent, Germany must &quot;also retain [[Atlantic Wall|military strong points]] on what was formerly the French Atlantic coast&quot; and emphasized that &quot;nothing on earth would persuade us to abandon such safe positions as those on the [[English Channel|Channel]] coast, captured during the campaign in France and consolidated by the [[Organisation Todt]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Several major French cities along the coast were given the designation ''[[German World War II strongholds|Festung]]'' (&quot;fortress&quot;; &quot;stronghold&quot;) by Hitler, such as [[Le Havre]], [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[St. Nazaire]],&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that they were to remain under permanent post-war German administration.

===Atlantic islands===
During the summer of 1940, Hitler considered the possibility of occupying the Portuguese [[Azores]], [[Cape Verde]] and [[Madeira]] and the Spanish [[Canary islands]] to deny the British a staging ground for military actions against Nazi-controlled Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fest 1973, p. 210&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stegemann211&quot;&gt;Stegemann &amp; Vogel 1995, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1940, Hitler further raised the issue in a discussion with the Spanish Foreign Minister [[Ramón Serrano Súñer|Serrano Súñer]], offering now Spain to transfer one of the Canary islands to German usage for the price of [[French Morocco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stegemann211&quot;/&gt; Although Hitler's interest in the Atlantic islands must be understood from a framework imposed by the military situation of 1940, he ultimately had no plans of ever releasing these important naval bases from German control.&lt;ref name=&quot;stegemann211&quot;/&gt;

It had been alleged by Canadian historian Holger Herwig that both in November 1940 and May 1941, leading into and through to the period in which Japan began planning [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|the naval attack]] that would bring the United States into the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gailey |first=Harry A. |date=1997 |title=War in the Pacific: From Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay |url= |location= |publisher=Presidio |page=68 |isbn=0-89141-616-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Hitler had stated that he had a desire to &quot;deploy long-range bombers against American cities from the [[Azores]].&quot; Due to their location, Hitler seemed to think that a Luftwaffe airbase located on the Portuguese Azores islands were Germany's &quot;only possibility of carrying out aerial attacks from a land base against the United States&quot;, in a period about a year before the May 1942 emergence of the ''[[Amerika Bomber]]'' trans-oceanic range strategic bomber design competition.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, James P. Target America: &quot;Hitler's Plan to Attack the United States&quot;. The Lyons Press, 2006. ISBN 978-1-59228-934-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
Relations between Germany and Poland altered from the early to the late 1930s. While Hitler and Nazi party before taking power openly talked about destroying Poland and were hostile to Poles, after gaining power until February 1939 Hitler tried to conceal his true intentions towards Poland and revealed them only to his closest associates; the signing of non-aggression pact with Poland in 1934 was a political maneuver to conceal his true intentions towards Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
The German Reich publicly claimed to seek rapproachment with Poland to avoid Poland entering the Soviet sphere of influence, and appealed to anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jan Karski 2014. P197&quot;&gt;Jan Karski. ''The Great Powers and Poland: From Versailles to Yalta''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014. P197.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union in turn at this time competed with Germany for influence in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jan Karski 2014. P197&quot;/&gt; In 1934 Poland reached several agreements with Germany. One was an agreement on the treatment of minorities in both countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Blanke 1939. P. 215&quot;&gt;Richard Blanke. Orphans of Versailles: The Germans in Western Poland, 1918–1939. Lexington, Kentucky, USA: University Press of Kentucky, 1993. P. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The other was a non-aggression pact in which both countries agreed to peaceful settlement of disputes, including that over territory; the agreement however still regarded the two countries as not having settled their borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44&quot;/&gt; At this time, Germany sought to convince  Poland that it would allow for Polish existence should Germany invade the Soviet Union resulting in Germany taking lebensraum from the Soviet Union, by offering Poland the right to annex the entirety of Ukraine from the Soviet Union while Germany would annex other Soviet territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44&quot;/&gt; In 1937, Germany condemned Poland for violating the minorities agreement, but publicly proposed that it would accept a resolution whereby Germany would reciprocally accept the Polish demand for Germany abandon assimilation of Polish minorities if Poland upheld its agreement to abandon assimilation of Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Blanke 1939. P. 215&quot;/&gt;

Germany's proposal was met with resistance in Poland, particularly by the Polish Western Union (PZZ) and the opposition party National Democratic party, with Poland only agreeing to a watered down version of the Joint Declaration on Minorities, on 5 November 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Blanke 1939. P. 215&quot;/&gt; Hitler welcomed this agreement and meet with representatives of Polish government and representatives of Polish minority in Germany, but in secret was frustrated and held a meeting where he declared to prepare Germany for a war to destroy Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Blanke 1939. P. 215&quot;/&gt; However, later in December 1938, Hitler indicated to his confidants that he was still interested in utilizing Poland in a war against the Soviet Union, claiming that Polish soldiers fighting alongside Germany against the Soviet Union would be beneficial in that it would reduce the need for German manpower in the fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44&quot;/&gt;
At the same time Nazi Germany has been secretly preparing German minority in Poland for war&lt;ref&gt;Maria Wardzyńska, &quot;Był rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpieczeństwa w Polsce Intelligenzaktion Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, IPN

P44&quot;/&gt;

Ribbentrop in private discussion with German officials stated that he hoped that by offering Poland territories in the Soviet Union, that Germany would gain not only from Polish cooperation in a war with the Soviet Union, but also that Poland would surrender Polish Corridor to Germany in exchange for these gains, because though it would lose access to the [[Baltic Sea]], it would gain access to the [[Black Sea]] via Ukraine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44&quot;/&gt; However Beck refused German demands to annex territory inhabited by majority of Poles and connecting majority of Polish exports and imports with the outside world and was shocked at the idea of a war with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44&quot;/&gt; Polish administration saw the plan as a threat to Polish sovereignty, practically subordinating Poland to the Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc while reducing the country to a state of near-servitude as its entire trade would be dependent on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/yellow/ylbk113.htm Avalon Project : The French Yellow Book : No. 113 - M. Coulondre, French Ambassador in Berlin, to M. Georges Bonnet, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Berlin, April 30, 1939]&lt;/ref&gt; With the aftermath of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and creation of a German client state of Slovakia, the German government believed that Poland would yield to German demands, however it did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44&quot;/&gt; In private, Hitler revealed in May that Danzig was not the real issue to him, but pursuit of Lebensraum for Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005. P44&quot;/&gt;

The one Germanic-language speaking country that was not included in the Pan-Germanic unification aim was the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of its near-universal acceptance by the Nazi government as being part of the Germanic world.&lt;ref&gt;Strobl 2000, pp. 36–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Leading [[Nordicism|Nordic ideologist]] [[Hans F. K. Günther]] theorized that the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had been more successful than the Germans in maintaining racial purity and that the coastal and island areas of [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Cornwall]] and [[Wales]] had received additional Nordic blood through [[Viking expansion#Britain and Ireland|Norse raids and colonization]] during the [[Viking Age]], and the Anglo-Saxons of [[East Anglia]] and Northern England had been [[Danelaw|under Danish rule]] in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;strobl84&quot;&gt;Strobl 2000, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Günther referred to this historical process as ''Aufnordung'' (&quot;additional nordification&quot;), which finally culminated in the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066.&lt;ref name=&quot;strobl84&quot;/&gt; Britain was thus a nation created by struggle and the [[survival of the fittest]] among the various Aryan peoples of the isles, and was able to pursue global conquest and empire-building because of its superior racial heredity born through this development.&lt;ref&gt;Strobl 2000, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler professed an admiration for the imperial might of the [[British Empire]] in ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' as proof of the racial superiority of the Aryan race,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zweites&quot;&gt;Hitler 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; hoping that Germany would emulate British &quot;ruthlessness&quot; and &quot;absence of moral scruples&quot; in establishing its own colonial empire in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Strobl 2000, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his primary foreign policy aims throughout the 1930s was to establish a military alliance with both the English (Hitler conflated [[England]] with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the United Kingdom in his writings and speeches) as well as the Italians to neutralize France as a strategic threat to German security for [[Drang Nach Osten|eastward]] [[Lebensraum|expansion]].

When it became apparent to the National Socialist leadership that the United Kingdom was not interested in a military alliance, anti-British policies were adopted to ensure the attainment of Germany’s war aims. Even during the war however, hope remained that Britain would in time yet become a reliable German ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich2&quot;&gt;Rich 1974, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler preferred to see the British Empire preserved as a world power, because its [[Societal collapse|break-up]] would benefit other countries far more than it would Germany, particularly the [[United States]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich2&quot;/&gt; In fact, Hitler's strategy during 1935-1937 for winning Britain over was based on a German guarantee of defence of the British Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicosia73&quot;&gt;Nicosia 2000, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Ribbentrop testified that in 1935 Hitler had promised to deliver twelve German divisions to the disposal of Britain for maintaining the integrity of her colonial possessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicosia74&quot;&gt;Nicosia 2000, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BFCgroup.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[British Free Corps]] of the [[Waffen SS]] with German officers, April 1944]]
The continued military actions against Britain after the fall of France had the strategic goal of making Britain 'see the light' and conduct an [[armistice]] with the [[Axis powers]], with July 1, 1940, being named by the Germans as the &quot;probable date&quot; for the cessation of hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hildebrand99&quot;&gt;Hildebrand 1973, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 1940, [[Franz Halder]], the head of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army General Staff]], after a consultation with Hitler concerning the aims envisaged by the Führer during the present war, wrote in his diary: &quot;We are seeking contact with Britain on the basis of partitioning the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hildebrand96&quot;&gt;Hildebrand 1973, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Hitler's sub-goals for the invasion of Russia was to win over Britain to the German side. He believed that after the military collapse of the [[USSR]], &quot;within a few weeks&quot; Britain would be forced either into a surrender or else come to join Germany as a &quot;junior partner&quot; in the Axis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hildebrand105&quot;&gt;Hildebrand 1973, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's role in this alliance was reserved to support German naval and [[Amerika Bomber|aerial military actions]] against the USA in a fight for [[Hegemony|world supremacy]] conducted from the Axis power bases of Europe, Africa and the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hildebrand100105&quot;&gt;Hildebrand 1973, pp. 100–105.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 8, 1941, Hitler stated that he looked forward to the eventual day when &quot;England and Germany [march] together against America&quot; and on January 7, 1942, he daydreamed that it was &quot;not impossible&quot; for Britain to quit the war and join the Axis side, leading to a situation where &quot;it will be a German-British army that will chase the [[Occupation of Iceland|Americans from Iceland]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinkus259&quot;&gt;Pinkus 2005, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; National Socialist ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] hoped that after the victorious conclusion of the war against the USSR, [[English people|Englishmen]], along with other Germanic nationalities, would join the German settlers in colonizing the conquered eastern territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;fest685&quot;/&gt;

From a historical perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the [[Austrian Empire]] found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich2&quot;/&gt; As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from [[German Confederation|German affairs]], so too would Britain be excluded from [[Continental Europe|continental affairs]] in the event of a German victory. Yet afterwards, [[Austria-Hungary]] became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-[[World War I]] [[Great power politics|power alignments]] in Europe, and it was hoped that Britain would come to fulfill this same role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich2&quot;/&gt;

===Channel Islands===
{{Further information|Occupation of the Channel Islands}}
The British [[Channel Islands]] were to be permanently integrated into the Germanic Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 1940, Hitler stated that after the war, the islands were to be given to the control of [[Robert Ley]]'s [[German Labour Front]], and transferred into ''[[Strength Through Joy]]'' holiday resorts.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandersxxiv&quot;&gt;Sanders 2005, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  German scholar Karl Heinz Pfeffer toured the islands in 1941, and recommended that the German occupiers should appeal to the islanders' Norman heritage and treat the islands as &quot;Germanic [[micro-states]]&quot;, whose union with Britain was only an accident of history.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanders188&quot;&gt;Sanders 2005, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; He likened the preferred policy concerning the islands similar to the one pursued by the British in [[Malta]], where the [[Maltese language]] had been &quot;artificially&quot; supported against the [[Italian language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sanders188&quot;/&gt;

===Ireland===
{{Further information|Operation Green (Ireland)}}
A [[military operation plan]] for the invasion of Ireland in support of [[Operation Sea Lion]] was drawn up by the Germans in August 1940. Occupied Ireland was to be ruled along with Britain in a temporary administrative system divided into six military-economic commands, with one of the headquarters being situated in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's future position in the New Order is unclear, but it is known that Hitler would have [[United Ireland|united]] [[Ulster]] with the Irish state.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 2006, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

P211.&lt;/ref&gt; but not southern Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler: diagnosis of a destructive prophet. Oxford University Press, 2000. P418&lt;/ref&gt; He even admitted that The Ahnenerbe, an archaeological organization associated with the SS, asserted that archaeological evidence proved the presence of Nordic-Germanic peoples in the region of South Tyrol in the [[Neolithic|Neolithic era]] that it claimed proved the significance of ancient Nordic-Germanic influence on northern Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingo Haar 1945. P130&quot;&gt;Ingo Haar, Michael Fahlbusch. German Scholars and Ethnic Cleansing, 1919-1945. P130.&lt;/ref&gt; The NSDAP regime regarded the ancient Romans to have been largely a people of the [[Mediterranean race]] however they claimed that the Roman ruling classes were Nordic, descended from Aryan conquerors from the North; and that this Nordic Aryan minority was responsible for the rise of Roman civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alan J. Levine 1996. P97&quot;&gt;Alan J. Levine. ''Race Relations Within Western Expansion''. Praeger Publishers, 1996. P97.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Socialists viewed the downfall of the [[Roman Empire]] as being the result of the deterioration of the purity of the Nordic Aryan ruling class through its intermixing with the inferior Mediterranean types that led to the empire's decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alan J. Levine 1996. P97&quot;/&gt; In addition, racial intermixing in the population in general was also blamed for Rome's downfall, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Due to the darker complexion of Mediterranean peoples, Hitler regarded them as having traces of Negroid blood and therefore did not have strong Nordic Aryan heritage and were thus inferior to those that had stronger Nordic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent. Modern Political Ideologies. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009  P308.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler held immense admiration for the [[Roman Empire]] and its legacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alex Scobie Pp 21-22&quot;&gt;Alex Scobie. ''Hitler's State Architecture: The Impact of Classical Antiquity''. Pp 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler praised post-Roman era achievements of northern Italians such as [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Dante Alighieri]], and [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;R J B Bosworth. Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Dictatorship, 1915-1945&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis ascribed the great achievements of post-Roman era northern Italians to the presence of Nordic racial heritage in such people who via their Nordic heritage had Germanic ancestors, such as NSDAP Foreign Affairs official [[Alfred Rosenberg]] recognizing Michelangelo and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as exemplary Nordic men of history.&lt;ref name=&quot;David B. Dennis 2012. P17-19&quot;&gt;David B. Dennis. ''Inhumanities: Nazi Interpretations of Western Culture''. Cambridge University Press, 2012. P17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; German official Hermann Hartmann wrote that Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] was clearly Nordic with deep Germanic roots because of his blond hair, blue eyes, and long face.&lt;ref name=&quot;David B. Dennis 2012. P17-19&quot;/&gt; The Nazis claimed that aside from biologically Nordic people that a Nordic soul could inhabit a non-Nordic body.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Groebel, Robert A. Hinde. Aggression and War: Their Biological and Social Bases. Cambridge University Press, 1989. P159.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler emphasized the role of Germanic influence in Northern Italy, such as stating that the art of [[Northern Italy]] was &quot;nothing but pure German&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich1974&quot;&gt;Rich 1974, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; and National Socialist scholars viewed that the [[Ladin language|Ladin]] and [[Friulian language|Friulian]] minorities of Northern Italy were racially, historically and culturally a part of the Germanic world.&lt;ref name=&quot;haar121&quot;&gt;Wedekind 2006, pp. 113, 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; To put it bluntly, Hitler declared in private talks that the modern Reich should emulate the racial policy of the [[Holy Roman Empire|old Roman-Germanic Holy Empire]], by annexing the Italian lands and especially Lombardy, whose population had well preserved their original Germanic Aryan character, unlike the lands of East Europe, with its racially alien population, scarcely marked by a Germanic contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Cameron, R. H. Stevens. Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944: His Private Conversations. Enigma Books, 2000. p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, German are more closely linked with the Italians than with any other people.&lt;ref name=Rich1974/&gt; Plans to incorporate northern Italy into the Greater Germanic Reich were influenced by the collapse of the fascist Italian government in 1943.

&quot;From the cultural point of view, we are more closely linked with the Italians than with any other people. The art of Northern Italy is something we have in common with them: nothing but pure Germans.
The objectionable Italian type is found only in the South, and not everywhere even there. We also have this type in our own country. When I think of them: Vienna-Ottakring, Munich-Giesing, Berlin-Pankow ! If I compare the two types, that of these degenerate Italians and our type, I find it very difficult to say which of the two is the more antipathetic.&quot;

The Nazi regime's stances in regards to northern Italy was influenced by the regime's relations with the Italian government, and particularly Mussolini's Fascist regime. Hitler deeply admired and emulated Mussolini. Hitler emphasized the racial closeness of his ally Mussolini to Germans of Alpine racial heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Breiting, Adolf Hitler, Édouard Calic (ed.). ''Secret conversations with Hitler:the two newly-discovered 1931 interviews''. John Day Co., 1971. P. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler regarded Mussolini to not be seriously contaminated by the blood of the Mediterranean race.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Other National Socialists had negative views of Mussolini and the Fascist regime. The NSDAP's first leader, [[Anton Drexler]] was one of the most extreme in his negative views of Mussolini&amp;nbsp;– claiming that Mussolini was &quot;probably&quot; a Jew and that Fascism was a Jewish movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;B. Bosworth. 2014&quot;&gt;R. J. B. Bosworth. ''Mussolini''. Bloomsbury, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there was a perception in Germany of Italians being racially weak, feckless, corrupt and corrupting, bad soldiers as perceived as demonstrated at the [[Battle of Caporetto]] in World War I, for being part of the powers that established the Treaty of Versailles, and for being a treacherous people given Italy's abandonment of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I to join the Entente.&lt;ref name=&quot;B. Bosworth. 2014&quot;/&gt; Hitler responded to the review of Italy betraying Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I by saying that this was a consequence of Imperial Germany's decision to focus its attention on upholding the moribund Austro-Hungarian empire while ignoring and disregarding the more promising Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;B. Bosworth. 2014&quot;/&gt;

The region of South Tyrol had been a place of contending claims and conflict between [[German nationalism]] and [[Italian nationalism]]. One of the leading founders of Italian nationalism, [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], along with [[Ettore Tolomei]], claimed that the German-speaking South Tyrolian population were in fact mostly a Germanicized population of Roman origin who needed to be &quot;liberated and returned to their rightful culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jens Woelk 2008. P. 5&quot;&gt;Jens Woelk, Francesco Palermo, Joseph Marko. ''Tolerance Through Law: Self Governance and Group Rights In South Tyrol''. Leiden, Netherlands: Koninlijke Brill NV, 2008. P. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; With the defeat of [[Austria-Hungary]] in [[World War I]], the peace treaty designated to Italy the South Tyrol, with its border with Austria along the [[Brenner Pass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jens Woelk 2008. P. 5&quot;/&gt; The Italian Fascist regime pursued [[Italianization]] of South Tyrol, by restricting use of the German language while promoting the Italian language; promoting mass migration of Italians into the region, encouraged mainly through industrialization; and resettlement of the German-speaking population.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Woelk, Francesco Palermo, Joseph Marko. ''Tolerance Through Law: Self Governance and Group Rights In South Tyrol''. Leiden, Netherlands: Koninlijke Brill NV, 2008. P. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mussolini had made clear in 1922 that he would never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz P. 10&quot;&gt;Christian Leitz. ''Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933-1941: The Road to Global War''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: P. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' had declared that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;H. James Burgwyn 1940. P. 81&quot;&gt;[[H. James Burgwyn]]. ''Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940''. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1997. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Mein Kampf'' Hitler also made clear that he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz P. 10&quot;/&gt; This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz P. 10&quot;/&gt;

On 7 May 1938, Hitler during a public visit to [[Rome]] declared his commitment to the existing border between Germany (that included Austria upon the Anschluss) and Italy at the Brenner Pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolf Steininger Pp. 49&quot;&gt;Rolf Steininger. ''South Tyrol: A Minority Conflict of the Twentieth Century''. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Hitler and Mussolini resolved the problem of self-determination of Germans and maintaining the [[Brenner Pass]] frontier by an agreement in which German South Tyroleans were given the choice of either assimilation into Italian culture, or leave South Tyrol for Germany; most opted to leave for Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolf Steininger Pp. 49&quot;/&gt;

After King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] of the Kingdom of Italy removed Mussolini from power, Hitler on 28 July 1943 was preparing for the expected abandonment of the Axis for the Allies by the Kingdom of Italy's new government, and was preparing to exact retribution for the expected betrayal by planning to partition Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen Welsh Dulles 1996&quot;&gt;[[Allen Welsh Dulles]], Neal H. Petersen, United States. [[Office of Strategic Services]]. Bern Office. ''From Hitler's Doorstep: The Wartime Intelligence Reports of Allen Dulles, 1942-1945''. Pennsylvania State Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular Hitler was considering the creation of a &quot;Lombard State&quot; in northern Italy that would be incorporated into the Greater Germanic Reich, while South Tyrol and Venice would be annexed directly into Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen Welsh Dulles 1996&quot;/&gt;

In the aftermath of the Kingdom of Italy's abandonment of the Axis on 8 September 1943, Germany seized and ''de facto'' incorporated Italian territories into its direct control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Susan Zuccotti 1996. P. 148&quot;&gt;Dr Susan Zuccotti, Furio Colombo. The ''Italians and the Holocaust: Persecution, Rescue, and Survival''. [[University of Nebraska Press]] paperback edition, 1996. P. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Kingdom of Italy capitulated to the Allies in September 1943, according to Goebbels in his personal diary on 29 September 1943, wrote that Hitler had expressed that the Italian-German border should extend to those of the region of [[Veneto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;petacco50&quot;&gt;Petacco 2005, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Veneto was to be included into the Reich in an &quot;autonomous form&quot;, and to benefit from the post-war influx of German tourists.&lt;ref name=&quot;petacco50&quot;/&gt; At the time when Italy was on the verge of declaring [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|an armistice]] with the Allies, Himmler declared to [[Felix Kersten]] that Northern Italy, along with the [[Swiss Italian|Italian-speaking]] part of Switzerland, was &quot;bound to eventually be included in Greater Germany anyway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kersten 1947, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italians by their infidelity and treachery have lost any claim to a national state of the modern type.|[[Joseph Goebbels]], September 1943|&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, pp. 320, 325&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the rescue of Mussolini and the establishment of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), in spite of urging by local German officials, Hitler refused to officially annex [[South Tyrol]], instead he decided that the RSI should hold official sovereignty over these territories, and forbade all measures that would give the impression of official annexation of South Tyrol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolf Steininger Pp. 69&quot;&gt;Rolf Steininger. ''South Tyrol: A Minority Conflict of the Twentieth Century''. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice the territory of [[South Tyrol]] within the boundaries defined by Germany as ''[[Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills|Operationszone Alpenvorland]]'' that included [[Trento|Trent]], [[Bolzano]], and [[Belluno]], were ''de facto'' incorporated into Germany's ''[[Reichsgau Tirol-Vorarlberg]]'' and administered by its ''[[Gauleiter]]'' [[Franz Hofer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Susan Zuccotti 1996.

P. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; While the region identified by Germany as ''[[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral|Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland]]'' that included [[Udine]], [[Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], [[Pula|Pola]], [[Province of Carnaro|Fiume]] (Rijeka), and [[Province of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]] were ''de facto'' incorporated into ''Reichsgau Kärnten'' and administered by its ''Gauleiter'' [[Friedrich Rainer]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrigo Petacco. ''Tragedy Revealed:The Story of Italians from Istria, Dalmatia, and Venezia Giulia, 1943-1956''. Toronto, Ontario, Canada: University of Toronto Press, 2005. P. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a supplementary OKW order dated 10 September 1943, Hitler decrees on the establishment of further Operational Zones in Northern Italy, which were the stretch all the way to the French border.&lt;ref name=&quot;germanyandthesecondwwvolvIIp79&quot;&gt;Kroener, Müller, Umbreit (2003), ''Germany and the Second World War: Volume V/II: Organization and Mobilization in the German Sphere of Power: Wartime Administration, Economy, and Manpower Resources 1942-1944/5'', p. 79, ISBN 0-19-820873-1&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ''Alpenvorland'' and ''Küstenland'', these zones did not immediately receive high commissioners (''oberster kommissar'') as civilian advisors, but were military regions where the commander was to exercise power on behalf of [[Army Group B]].&lt;ref name=&quot;germanyandthesecondwwvolvIIp79&quot;/&gt; Operation zone ''Nordwest-Alpen'' or ''Schweizer Grenze'' was located between the [[Stelvio Pass]] and [[Monte Rosa]] and was to contain wholly the Italian provinces of [[Province of Sondrio|Sondrio]] and [[Province of Como|Como]] and parts of the provinces of [[Province of Brescia|Brescia]], [[Province of Varese|Varese]], [[Province of Novara|Novara]] and [[Province of Vercelli|Vercelli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wedekind100101&quot;&gt;Wedekind 2003, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xaBzGwEeCqIC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=%22franz%C3%B6sische+grenze%22+operationszone&amp;hl=fi&amp;ei=ErqnTuetA8Sk4gSts5TtDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22franz%C3%B6sische%20grenze%22%20operationszone&amp;f=false Nationalsozialistische Besatzungs- und Annexionspolitik in Norditalien 1943 bis 1945]'', pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt; The zone of ''Französische Grenze'' was to encompass areas west of Monte Rosa and was to incorporate the province of [[Province of Aosta|Aosta]] and a part of the [[province of Turin]], and presumably also the provinces of [[Province of Cuneo|Cuneo]] and [[Province of Imperia|Imperia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wedekind100101&quot;/&gt;

From Autumn 1943 onward, members of the [[Ahnenerbe]], associated with the SS, asserted that archaeological evidence of ancient farmsteads and architecture proved the presence of Nordic-Germanic peoples in the region of South Tyrol in the Neolithic era including prototypical Lombard style architecture, the significance of ancient Nordic-Germanic influence on Italy, and most importantly that South Tyrol by its past and present and historic racial and cultural circumstances, was &quot;Nordic-Germanic national soil&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingo Haar 1945. P130&quot;/&gt;

==Expected participation in the colonization of Eastern Europe==
{{Further information|Generalplan Ost|Wehrbauer}}

Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, the primary goal of the German Reich’s territorial [[expansionism]] was to acquire sufficient ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) in [[Eastern Europe]] for the Germanic ''übermenschen'' or superior men. The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic [[autarky]], the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population,&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; and the wholesale [[Genocide|extermination]] of the indigenous [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] inhabitants and the [[Germanisation]] of [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;GEAST&quot;&gt;Madajczyk.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|[on German colonization of Russia] As for the two or three million men whom we need to accomplish this task, we will find them more quickly than we think. They will come from Germany, Scandinavia, the western countries, and America. I shall no longer be here to see all that, but in twenty years the [[Ukraine]] will already be a home for twenty million inhabitants besides the natives.|Adolf Hitler|&lt;ref&gt;Rich 1974, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of their perceived racial worth, the NSDAP leadership was enthusiastic at the prospect of &quot;recruiting&quot; people from the Germanic countries to also [[Settler colonialism|settle these territories]] after the Slavic inhabitants would have been driven out.&lt;ref&gt;Poprzeczny 2004, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The racial planners were partly motivated in this because studies indicated that Germany would likely not be able to recruit enough colonial settlers for the eastern territories from its own country and other Germanic groups would therefore be required.&lt;ref name=&quot;GEAST&quot;/&gt; Hitler insisted however that German settlers would have to dominate the newly colonized areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;wright2&quot;/&gt; Himmler's original plan for the [[Hegewald (colony)|Hegewald settlement]] was to settle Dutch and Scandinavians there in addition to Germans, which was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 2006, pp. 330-331&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development==
After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Hitler's preoccupation with the Pan-Germanic plan began to fade, although the idea was never abandoned. As the foreign volunteers of the Waffen-SS were increasingly of non-Germanic origin, especially after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], among the organization's leadership (e.g. [[Felix Steiner]]) the proposition for a Greater Germanic Empire gave way to a concept of a European union of self-governing states, unified by German hegemony and the common enemy of [[Bolshevism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stein&quot;&gt;Stein 1984, pp. 145–148.&lt;/ref&gt; The Waffen-SS was to be the eventual nucleus of a common European army, where each state would be represented by a national contingent.&lt;ref name=&quot;stein&quot;/&gt; Himmler himself, however, gave no concession to these views, and held on to his Pan-Germanic vision in a speech given in April 1943 to the officers of SS divisions ''[[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|LSAH]]'', ''[[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|Das Reich]]'' and ''[[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|Totenkopf]]'':

{{blockquote|We do not expect you to renounce your nation. ... We do not expect you to become German out of opportunism. We do expect you to subordinate your national ideal to a greater racial and historical ideal, to the Germanic Reich.&lt;ref name=&quot;stein&quot;/&gt;}}

A '''bombsite''' is the wreckage that remains after a bomb has destroyed a building or other structure.

==World War II bombsites==
After [[World War II]] many [[Europe]]an cities remained severely damaged from bombing. [[London]] and other British cities which had suffered the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] were pock-marked with bombsites, vacant lots covered in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Many postwar children in urban areas shared a common memory of playing their games and riding their bicycles across these desolate environments.&lt;ref&gt;

In London, [[Liverpool]], [[Bristol]], etc., across the channel in [[Berlin]] and other places these sites were constant reminders of the death and destruction of the war. This was a contributory factor to the European [[Social psychology|psycho-sociological]] outlook of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Bombsites in Literature and Media==
The rubble of Viennese bombsites and the remnants of the city's battered infrastructure serve as a backdrop to much of the action in the movie ''[[The Third Man (film)|The Third Man]]'', written by [[Graham Greene]], an author who would return to this bombsite motif again. Also, author Graham Greene references to bombsites in his 1954 short story &quot;[[The Destructors]]&quot;.

'''Political cartoons''' produced during '''World War II''' by both Allied and Axis powers commented upon the events, personalities and politics of the war.  Governments used them for [[propaganda]] and [[public information]].{{Dubious|Political cartoon versus propaganda cartoon|date=June 2011}} Individuals expressed their own political  views and preferences.

==History==
During [[World War II]], every major military power had propaganda offices that employed [[political cartoons]] to influence public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Müge Göçek | first = Fatma | title = Political Cartoons in the Middle East: Cultural Representations in the Middle East | publisher = Markus Wiener  Publishers | location = Princeton | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-55876-156-X |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ill Will Geisel Waiting for the Signal from Home 1942.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dr. Seuss]]'s cartoon ''Waiting for the Signal from Home'']]
Before the outbreak of war in Europe, Germany and the Soviet Union formed a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|pact]] to divide the intervening buffer zones between them, and started with the conquest of Poland.  The New Zealand cartoonist, [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], produced a  famous cartoon about this for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' which appeared on 20 September 1939.  It ridiculed the way in which the relationship of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] had changed from bitter enmity to courteous cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Propaganda and mass persuasion: a historical encyclopedia, 1500 to the present |chapter=Cartoons |page=66 |author=David Culbert |isbn=978-1-57607-820-4 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Szyk]] received recognition for his political cartoons during World War II.  First lady Eleanor Roosevelt called him a &quot;one-man army.&quot;  Adolf Hitler even put a price on his head.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB423B21EA79101&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Chicago Sun-Times August 14, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dr. Seuss]] worked in an animation department of the U.S. Army, where he drew more than 400 political cartoons &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/focus/s_696501.html&lt;/ref&gt; He published many political cartoons against Hitler and Mussolini, as well as Americans who were against American involvement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uccsscribe.com/mobile/culture/happy-birthday-dr-suess-1.2501206&lt;/ref&gt; His cartoon, titled ''Waiting for the Signal From Home'', published shortly before [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered [[Japanese American internment]], and depicting West Coast Asians preparing dynamite attacks, was described by Donald Dewey as &quot;particularly tasteless&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dewey | first = Donald | title = The Art of Ill Will | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8147-1985-6 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and historian [[Richard Minear]], in ''[[Dr. Seuss Goes to War]]'' (1999), criticised Dr Seuss's wartime cartoons and suggested that &quot;racism was an ingredient in much if not all American wartime thinking about Japan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Boyd | first = Brian | title = On the Origin of Stories | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-674-03357-4|page=335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoonist [[Fougasse (cartoonist)|Fougasse]] produced a series of cartoons which the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] used on posters.  These included a series to illustrate the slogan, ''Careless talk costs lives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Careless Talk Costs Lives: Fougasse &amp; the Art of Public Information |author=James Taylor |publisher=Conway |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-84486-129-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet Union the style of cartooning was savage and unsubtle{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}.  Cartoons appeared in the satirical magazine, ''[[Krokodil]]''.  The byline &quot;[[Kukryniksy]]&quot; labeled the especially famous work of three artists, Mikhail Kupriyanov, Porfiri Krylov and Nikolai Sokolov, who worked together.&lt;ref name=ND&gt;{{citation |title=Europe at War 1939-1945 |author=Norman Davies |chapter=Cartoons |pages=445–446 |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-330-35212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent Krassousky, a Kiev-born émigré, produced pro-Nazi comics in occupied Paris.&lt;ref&gt;

[...H]is recurring character Vica (a Popeye-type sailor) mocked and excoriated England, America, the Bolsheviks, and 'Jewish conspiracies.'
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The French-language comic-strip series &quot;Marc le Téméraire&quot; [Marc the Bold] (1943) conveyed anti-communist and anti-English messages through the deeds of a [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] member of the Vichy ''[[Milice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] 'Marc le Téméraire,' the only realistic strip of the paper, followed the efforts of Milice members Marc and Paul working with the Germans to rout out Soviet spies.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to official government-sponsored propaganda, [[German-occupied Europe]] also produced [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] cartoons mocking the new order.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote         = We put out several books of political cartoons, making fun of Hitler and Nazism. For instance, one cartoon depicted German soldiers overrunning the Netherlands. [...] It wasn't difficult to sell that book, or any of the other things. People didn't have much to buy during the German occupation, so, in that way, at least, it was an opportune time to ask them to open their wallets.

'''World War II combatives''' are [[Close Quarters Battle|close quarters combat]] techniques, including hand-to-hand, advanced firearm [[point shooting]] methods, and weapons techniques (knife/bayonet/improvised weapons) that were taught to allied [[special forces]] in [[World War II]] by such famous instructors as [[Rex Applegate]] and [[William E. Fairbairn|William Ewart Fairbairn]].

Distinctions between World War II combatives and modern [[combatives]] include: 1) The former is based upon explosive high percentage gross motor strikes to vital targets, whereas the latter is based upon fine motor skill grappling. 2) The former seeks primarily to disable the enemy as quickly as possible at all costs, whereas the latter seeks primarily to build &quot;warrior ethos&quot; and the courage to close with the enemy.

==Background==
World War II combatives are rooted in [[British Empire|British colonial history]] with the [[Shanghai Municipal Police]] (1854–1943), pioneers of modern [[SWAT]], who operated in what was widely acknowledged as the most dangerous port city in the world at the time. After studying under some of the finest warriors of pre-Communist China and pre-war Japan, these officers condensed the most practical elements of these arts, combined it with elements of Shanghai gangster fighting, and field-tested their skills in over 2000 documented encounters, including over 600 lethal force engagements{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

==World War II==
Upon return to the UK and US, veterans of the [[Shanghai Municipal Police]] were tasked in training allied World War II [[commandos]] and intelligence personnel, including the [[British Commandos]] - [[Special Air Service|SAS]] &amp; [[Special Boat Service|SBS]], the US/Canadian 1st Special Service Force (&quot;[[First Special Service Force|Devil's Brigade]]&quot;), the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (precursor to the CIA), the British [[Special Operation Executive]], [[Marine Raider]] Units, and the [[US Army Rangers]]. Upon engagement with enemy personnel skilled in classical European arts and old school judo, the post-battlefield reports of the “Shanghai method” produced the highest number of documented kills{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} of any combatives system to date.

'''Veterans Day''' is an official [[Public holidays in the United States|United States public holiday]], observed annually on November 11, that honors [[Veteran|military veterans]]; that is, persons who served in the [[United States Armed Forces]]. It coincides with other holidays, including [[Armistice Day]] and [[Remembrance Day]], celebrated in other countries that mark the anniversary of the end of [[World War I]]; major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when the [[Armistice with Germany]] went into effect. The United States previously observed Armistice Day. The U.S. holiday was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.

Veterans Day is not to be confused with [[Memorial Day]], a U.S. public holiday in May; Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans, while Memorial Day honors those who ''died'' while in military service.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelber&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Today is not Veterans Day| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/parenting/homefront/bal-memorial-day-vs-veterans-day-20120528,0,1402423.story| date=28 May 2012| last=Kelber| first=Sarah Kickler| work=[[Baltimore Sun]]| accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

On November 11, 1919, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued a message to his countrymen on the first Armistice Day in which he expressed what he felt the day meant to Americans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;ADDRESS TO FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN 
The White House, November 11, 1919. 

A year ago today our enemies laid down their arms in accordance with an armistice which rendered them impotent to renew hostilities, and gave to the world an assured opportunity to reconstruct its shattered order and to work out in peace a new and juster set of inter national relations. The soldiers and people of the European Allies had fought and endured for more than four years to uphold the barrier of civilization against the aggressions of armed force. We ourselves had been in the conflict something more than a year and a half. - With splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns, we re modeled our industries, concentrated our financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our power was a decisive factor in the victory. We were able to bring the vast resources, material and moral, of a great and free people to the assistance of our associates in Europe who had suffered and sacrificed without limit in the cause for which we fought. Out of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes, and the victory of arms foretells the enduring conquests which can be made in peace when nations act justly and in furtherance of the common interests of men. To us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with - solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service, and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of nations. 

WOODROW WILSON&lt;ref name = cmh&gt;{{cite web| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=WYg_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8803&amp;lpg=PA8803&amp;dq=%22a+year+ago+today+our+enemies+laid+down+their+arms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SAyvxEs4yr&amp;sig=tkkBHzQnk_V0Cnessu7W0Xyl6Ag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAWoVChMIrYvdjcOJyQIViHgmCh1ytwxt#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20year%20ago%20today%20our%20enemies%20laid%20down%20their%20arms%22&amp;f=false| title = Supplement to the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: Covering the Second Term of Woodrow Wilson, March 4, 1917, to March 4, 1921 | date = 11 November 2015| publisher = [[Bureau of National Literature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United States Congress adopted a resolution on June 4, 1926, requesting that President [[Calvin Coolidge]] issue annual proclamations calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies.&lt;ref name = cmh/&gt; A Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made the 11th of November in each year a legal holiday: &quot;a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and known as 'Armistice Day'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans Day History|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp|publisher=Veteran's Affairs|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Veterans Day parade in Baltimore, 2016.jpg|thumb|Veterans Day parade in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], 2016]]
In 1945, [[World War II]] veteran Raymond Weeks from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], had the idea to expand Armistice Day to celebrate all veterans, not just those who died in [[World War I]]. Weeks led a delegation to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who supported the idea of National Veterans Day. Weeks led the first national celebration in 1947 in Alabama and annually until his death in 1985. President Reagan honored Weeks at the White House with the Presidential Citizenship Medal in 1982 as the driving force for the national holiday. Elizabeth Dole, who prepared the briefing for President Reagan, determined Weeks as the &quot;Father of Veterans Day.&quot;

U.S. Representative [[Edward Herbert Rees|Ed Rees]] from [[Emporia, Kansas]], presented a bill establishing the holiday through Congress. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], also from Kansas, signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954. It had been eight and a half years since Weeks held his first Armistice Day celebration for all veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carter |first=Julie |title=Where Veterans Day began |journal=VFW Magazine |date=November 2003 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0LIY/is_3_91/ai_110734282 |publisher=Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress amended the bill on June 1, 1954, replacing &quot;Armistice&quot; with &quot;Veterans,&quot; and it has been known as Veterans Day since.&lt;ref name=VAhistory&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-11-06 |url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp |title=History of Veterans Day|publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |date=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2007-11-01 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/reference/holidays/vetsday/vetshist.html |title=The History of Veterans Day |publisher=United States Army Center of Military History (CMH) |date=2003-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Veterans Award was also created in 1954. Congressman Rees of Kansas received the first National Veterans Award in Birmingham, Alabama for his support offering legislation to make Veterans Day a federal holiday.

Although originally scheduled for celebration on November 11 of every year, starting in 1971 in accordance with the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]], Veterans Day was moved to the fourth Monday of October (Oct 25, 1971; Oct 23, 1972; Oct 22, 1973; Oct 28, 1974; Oct 27, 1975; Oct 25, 1976 and Oct 24, 1977). In 1978, it was moved back to its original celebration on November 11. While the legal holiday remains on November 11, if that date happens to be on a Saturday or Sunday, then organizations that formally observe the holiday will normally be closed on the adjacent Friday or Monday, respectively.

==Observance==
[[File:Veterans Day 2007 poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Veterans Day 2007 Poster]]
Because it is a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]], some American workers and many students have Veterans Day off from work or school. When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated as the holiday, whereas if it falls on a Sunday it is typically observed on the following Monday. A [[Society for Human Resource Management]] poll in 2010 found that 21 percent of employers planned to observe the holiday in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2011 Holiday Schedules SHRM Poll |author=Society for Human Resource Management |date=November 4, 2010 |url= http://www.shrm.org/Research/SurveyFindings/Articles/Pages/2011HolidaySchedules.aspx }}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-essential federal government offices are closed. No mail is delivered. All federal workers are paid for the holiday; those who are required to work on the holiday sometimes receive holiday pay for that day in addition to their wages.

In his Armistice Day address to Congress, Wilson was sensitive to the psychological toll of the lean War years: &quot;Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness,&quot; he remarked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2007 290&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Oxford companion to American food and drink |last= Smith|first= Andrew F.|year= 2007|publisher= Oxford University Press, Inc|location= New York|isbn= 0-19-530796-8|page= 290|url= https://books.google.com/?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&amp;pg=PT317&amp;lpg=PT317&amp;dq=armistice+day#v=onepage&amp;q=armistice%20day&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Veterans Day and the birthday of the [[United States Marine Corps]] (November 10, 1775) are only one day apart, that branch of the Armed Forces customarily observes both occasions as a 96-hour liberty period.

Several commentators have noted the irony of [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] being a regular working day, while Veterans Day, which typically falls the following week, is a federal holiday. Many people have called for the holidays to be merged, so citizens can have a day off to vote. This would be seen as a way to honor voting by exercising democratic rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutter|first1=John D.|title=Election Day should be a federal holiday|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/opinion/ctl-election-holiday/|accessdate=20 October 2016|work=CNN|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Proposals|url=http://policyproposals.com/10-memorial-dayveterans-dayelection-day-holiday/|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spelling of Veterans Day===
While the holiday is commonly printed as ''Veteran's Day'' or ''Veterans' Day'' in calendars and advertisements (spellings that are grammatically acceptable), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Web site states that the [[attributive noun|attributive]] (no apostrophe) rather than the [[possessive case]] is the official spelling &quot;because it is not a day that 'belongs' to veterans, it is a day for honoring all veterans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetday_faq.asp Veterans Day Frequently Asked Questions], Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

[[Image:Angus-Montrose.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Location of Montrose, Angus, Scotland]]
[[File:MASHC layout.png|thumb|Layout of Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre]]

The '''Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre''' is located to the North of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], [[Angus]], [[Scotland]]. Montrose has the distinction of having the first operational military [[airfield]] in [[Great Britain]] and the Heritage Centre is located on the former airfield. It aims to show the human side of its history with a collection of contemporary photographs, artefacts and memorabilia. These not only tell of the history of the airfield but also the story of the men and women who served there and those who lived in the area.

The [[Royal Air Force station|Air Station]] [[Heritage centre|Heritage Centre]] is run by the Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust and is a registered [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator|Scottish charitable organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC023193|The Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is self-financing, relying on visitors fees and donations together with grants from local government and the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. The centre receives no regular financial support from local or national government.&lt;ref name=MASHC&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.rafmontrose.org.uk/|work=Montrose Air Station|publisher=Montrose Air Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|RAF Montrose}}
The airfield was first opened on 1913 when five aircraft of [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No.2 Squadron]] Royal Flying Corps arrived. Montrose became the first operational military airfield in Great Britain and first military airfield in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Reocities&gt;{{cite web|title=Montrose|url=http://www.reocities.com/pentagon/barracks/6344/montrose.htm|work=Disused WWII Airfields in the N.E. Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air station closed in 1920 but was reopened in 1935 for use in the Second World War. After the war the airfield continued to be used as a maintenance unit until it closed on 4 June 1952.&lt;ref name=Ronaldv&gt;{{cite web|title=Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields in Europe|url=http://www.ronaldv.nl/abandoned/airfields/gb/scotland/tayside.html|publisher=Ronaldv.nl|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCT&gt;{{cite web|title=Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust|url=http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/montrose?tab=memorial|publisher=ABCT|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 a group of local enthusiast banded together to ensure that the history of Montrose Air Station would not be forgotten. A local man, Ian McIntosh, established the Montrose Air Station Heritage Trust, now known as the Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust and money was raised by the Montrose Aerodrome Museum Society.&lt;ref name=LTFAM&gt;{{cite book|title=Learning to Fly at Montrose|year=2005|publisher=Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust|location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the trust purchased the Watch Office and ground which became the Montrose Air Station Museum. Over the years the museum has added more buildings to house its increasing collection of artefacts, memorabilia and models aided by donations, local government grants and the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref name=HLF1&gt;{{cite news|title=Lottery Boost for Museum|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/news/local-headlines/163-48-000-lottery-boos-for-museum-1-342989|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Montrose Review|date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2012 a memorial stone was unveiled at the air station in remembrance of the units and personnel who were stationed there. The memorial was provided by the [[Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust]].&lt;ref name=ABCT /&gt;

===Training Pilots for War===
This project was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund&lt;ref name=HLF1 /&gt;  as well as local benefactors. It commenced in June 2010 and involved extending the Romney Building to create room for new facilities. These included a [[Link Trainer]], computer flight simulator and a learning zone with audio and video resources. It was completed in October 2012.&lt;ref name=Youtube1&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Pilot Training Project|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn5beiRx4jw|work=YouTube|publisher=Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spitfire Fund===
Similar to the wartime Spitfire Funds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spitfire Funds|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/spitfire_funds.htm|work=HistoryLearningSite.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  this was to raise money to purchase a full size replica Spitfire. Additional funding from Angus Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spitfire bid could take off with backing|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/community/spitfire-bid-could-take-off-with-backing-1-2115941|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Montrose Review|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has enabled the purchase of the Spitfire which now sits at the front of the main building. The Aircraft, made by GB Replicas, stands as a monument to the many people who served there during two World Wars. It is in the colours and markings of the [[No. 602 Squadron RAF|602 Squadron]] ([[City of Glasgow]]) Red Lichtie Spitfire.&lt;ref name=RedLichtie&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arbroath Spitfire|url=http://www.thearbroathspitfire.com/|publisher=Squadron Prints Ltd|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Red Lichtie was purchased in 1942 by the people of [[Arbroath]], Angus after they started a Spitfire fund and raised £5000.&lt;ref name=RedLichtie /&gt;
On 26 July 2013 HRH [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]] visited the Heritage Centre and unveiled the Spitfire and a commemorative stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STV News Earl of Wessex meets veterans as air station celebrates 100th anniversary|url=http://news.stv.tv/tayside/234205-earl-of-wessex-meets-veterans-as-montrose-air-station-celebrates-100-years/|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arbroath Spitfire|url=http://www.thearbroathspitfire.com//|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First in France 1914===
The first pilot to land in France after the declaration of war was Lieutenant [[H.D. Harvey-Kelly]] of No.2 Squadron RFC Montrose.The project is named after this event. A new building has been erected which will house the centre’s artefacts from World War I including the Robertson Cross and the replica [[Sopwith Camel]]. They have also constructed a full size replica [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2a aircraft]] and put together a comprehensive exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big boost for air station|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/news/local-headlines/big-boost-for-air-station-1-3352953|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also part of this project will involve the production of a Roll of Honour, an 'online' Book of Remembrance for pilots who were killed in accidents whilst flying at Montrose Air Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribute to Fallen Pilots|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/online-tribute-to-fallen-pilots-1-2631026|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Montrose Review|date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First in France 1914 project is supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].

===Wartime Pillbox and Anderson Shelter===
The [[Pillbox (military)|pillbox]] dates from 1949 and was an important part of the defences at Montrose.
The [[Air-raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelter]] was designed in 1938 by William Paterson and Oscar Carl (Karl) Kerrison in response to a request from the Home Office. It was named after Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], then [[Lord Privy Seal]] with special responsibility for preparing air-raid precautions immediately prior to the outbreak of World War II, and it was he who then initiated the development of the shelter. It was widely used by the civilian population during World War II

It houses the Vampire jet, Sopwith Camel and link trainer together with a display of [[aircraft engine]]s. There is also a Pilot Training Display including a computer flight simulator and a Learning Zone for visits from local schools.

===Lt John Ross Robertson Building===
The Heritage Centre's newest building was erected in July 2014 and funded by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. It was officially opened by the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of [[Angus]] Mrs Georgiana Osborne on 3 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montrose marks the centenary of WW1|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/news/local-headlines/montrose-marks-the-centenary-of-ww1-1-3502236|publisher=Montrose Review|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heritage Centers World War I artifacts will be on display in the building together with its replica [[Sopwith Camel]] and a full size replica [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2a]] aircraft which is currently under construction.

It stands as a memorial not just for Lt Robertson but to all the people who served at Montrose.

===Historic airfield buildings nearby===
To the immediate south of the Heritage Centre stand three aircraft hangars which are believed to be the oldest known example of their type in the world. The hangars were built at the end of 1913 and first used in early 1914 to house No. 2 Squadron when they moved to the airfield from Upper Dysart. Their design was based on Indian Army Sheds modified by Major Burke to house aircraft and were pre-fabricated in Glasgow before being transported to Montrose. The buildings were constructed of wood with corrugated iron roofs and each one had two gabled openings. The hangars were built in a curve following the path of railway line which used to be at the rear of the buildings.

The hangar farthest away from the heritage centre retains its original cladding. The building is a category:A [[Listed Building]]&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-38228-montrose-air-station-building-48-|title=Montrose Air Station Building 48 - Montrose - Angus - Scotland &amp;#124; British Listed Buildings|author=Good Stuff IT Services|publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Historic Scotland]] Building ID: 38228

The other two hangars have had a steel cladding added in 1987-8 and are category:B Listed Buildings &lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-38227-montrose-air-station-buildings-46-and-47-|title=Montrose Air Station Buildings 46 and 47 - Montrose - Angus - Scotland &amp;#124; British Listed Buildings|author=Good Stuff IT Services|publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Historic Scotland Building ID: 38227

The '''Latin Bloc''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Blocco Latino'', [[French language|French]]: ''Bloc Latin'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Bloque Latino'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Bloco Latino'') was a proposal for an alliance made the 1920s to the 1940s that began with Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] proposing such a bloc in 1927 between [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]], and [[Ditadura Nacional|Portugal]], that would be an alliance based upon common Latin civilization and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. A History of Fascism, 1914–1945. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1995. P. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was publicly discussed between the governments of Italy, Spain, and France, during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jlukacs&quot; /&gt;

In the 1930s, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Laval]] alongside French conservatives expressed support for a Latin Bloc with Italy and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Robert O Paxton. Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order 1940-1944. P. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During World War II the proposal was discussed between Mussolini, Spain's ''[[Caudillo]]'' [[Francisco Franco]], and [[Vichy France]]'s head of state [[Philippe Petain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jlukacs&quot; /&gt; However the alliance failed to materialize.&lt;ref name=&quot;jlukacs&quot; /&gt; The planned bloc would have united Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and [[Vatican City]] together as a bloc alliance based upon unity of the Latin culture European states that would be within the [[Axis powers]] that was designed to balance the power between them and [[Germany]] in the Axis by combining together.&lt;ref name=&quot;jlukacs&quot; /&gt; The main effort was to create a &quot;Rome-Madrid axis&quot;, Franco took a major role in promoting the proposal, and Franco with Vichy French leader Petain in [[Montpellier]], France in 1940 to discuss the proposal, and Franco met with Mussolini in [[Bordighera]], Italy in 1941 to discuss it.&lt;ref name=&quot;jlukacs&quot; /&gt; Germany supported the proposal for the Latin Bloc during World War II and German propaganda assisted Italian propaganda in promoting the bloc&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt.

This is a timeline of formal '''declarations of War during [[World War II]]'''.

A [[declaration of war]] is a formal act by which one nation goes to war against another.  The declaration is usually an act of delivering a  performative speech (not to be confused with a mere ''speech'') or the presentation of a signed document by an authorized party of a national government in order to create a [[War|state of war]] between two or more sovereign states.  The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|The Hague Peace Conference of 1907]] (or Hague II).&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague03.asp ''On the Opening of Hostilities'']; 1907; [[Yale]] Law School Library; retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the diplomatic maneuvering behind these events which led to hostilities between nations during World War II, see the article entitled [[Diplomatic history of World War II]].

==List of war declarations==
Below is a table showing the ''Outbreaks of Wars between Nations'' which occurred during World War II.  Indicated are the dates (during the immediate build-up to, or during the course of, [[World War II]]), from which a ''[[de facto]]'' [[War|state of war]] existed between nations.  The table shows both the &quot;Initiator Nation(s)&quot; and the nation at which the aggression was aimed, or &quot;Targeted Nation(s)&quot;.  Events listed include those in which there were simple diplomatic breaking of relations that did not involve any physical attack, as well as those involving overt declarations or acts of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Note:In rare cases, war between two nations occurred twice, with an intermittent period of peace. The list here does not include peace treaties or periods of any armistices.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reich Bride Schools''' ([[German language|German]]: '''''Reichsbräuteschule''''') were institutions established in [[Nazi Germany]] in the late 1930s. They were created to train young women to be &quot;perfect Nazi brides,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot; /&gt; indoctrinated in Nazi ideology and educated in housekeeping skills. The fiancées of prominent  [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members and senior [[Nazi Party]] officials (and later a wider range of German women) were taught skills ranging from cooking, child care, ironing and to how to polish their husbands' uniforms and daggers. They were required to swear oaths of loyalty to [[Adolf Hitler]], to pledge to raise their children as Nazis and to marry in pre-Christian 'Germanic' ceremonies presided over by Nazi officials, rather than in churches.

Although a number of bride schools were established in locations across Germany, the demands of the [[Second World War]] made it impossible for the Nazis to realise their ideal of women as being exclusively home-bound. Many women took up work instead in munitions factories and other war-related roles. Even so, the schools appear to have continued until as late as May 1944 but their existence faded from memory after the war, perhaps as a result of an unwillingness on the part of former Nazi brides to discuss their enrollment. The discovery in 2013 of original documentation relating to the schools resulted in fresh attention being brought to this particular chapter in the history of Nazi Germany.

==Women in the Nazi worldview==
{{main|Women in Nazi Germany}}
Women had a clearly defined position in the Nazi worldview. They were not deemed suitable for professions such as medicine, the law or the civil service, from which they were banned. They were instead expected to stay at home, maintain the household and have as many children as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot; /&gt; A woman's place was defined by the slogan ''kinder, küche, kirche'' (children, kitchen, church).&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; Reproductive success was rewarded with the ''[[Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter]]'' (Cross of Honour of the German Mother), which was awarded in bronze, silver and gold ranks – the latter going to mothers who had eight or more children.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/09/the-perfect-nazi-bride.html|title=The Perfect Nazi Bride|last=Greenhouse|first=Emily|work=The New Yorker|date=29 September 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis considered that the social changes that had taken place since the end of the [[First World War]], including a fall in birth rates and an increasing number of divorces, were undermining German society and the German race. Large families and a reversion to traditional gender roles were seen as essential, not least as a means of breeding future soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;GHI&quot; /&gt; The Nazi government passed a Law for the Encouragement of Marriage which enabled newlyweds take out a state loan of 1,000 [[reichsmark]]s (approximately €3,500) and keep a quarter for each child they had, in effect subsidising procreation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt;

Hitler told a conference of the [[National Socialist Women's League]] (''NS-Frauenschaft'') in September 1938: &quot;The slogan 'Emancipation of women' was invented by Jewish intellectuals and its content was formed by the same spirit. In the really good times of German life the German woman had no need to emancipate herself ... If the man's world is said to be the State, his struggle, his readiness to devote his powers to the service of the community, then it may perhaps be said that the woman's is a smaller world. For her world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GHI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=1557|title=Hitler’s Speech to the National Socialist Women’s League (September 8, 1934)|publisher=German Historical Institute, Washington, DC|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi viewpoint was summed up by Hermann Göring in his &quot;Nine Commandments for the Workers’ Struggle&quot;, published in 1934, in which he exhorted women to &quot;take hold of the frying pan, dust pan, and broom, and marry a man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot; /&gt; Young girls were compelled to join the [[League of German Girls]] (''Bund Deutscher Mädel'') while older women became members of the NS-Frauenschaft. [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]], the head of the NS-Frauenschaft, told a Nazi party conference in 1935 that &quot;women must be the spiritual caregivers and the secret queens of our people, called upon by fate for this special task.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/10/01/nazi_bride_schools_educated_german_women_in_racial_values_and_homemaking.html|title=At Least You’re Not at Nazi Bride School|last=Waldman|first=Katy|work=Slate|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment of the Reich Bride Schools==

In 1936, ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] came to an agreement with Scholtz-Klink to put her views into practice, with Himmler issuing a decree ordering women engaged to SS members to undergo training in how to become brides who would conform to the Nazi ideal of how women should live.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot; /&gt; They were also to undergo training to provide them with &quot;special knowledge of race and genetics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DieWelt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Abschlussprüfung für die perfekte SS-Braut|url=http://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article118919362/Abschlusspruefung-fuer-die-perfekte-SS-Braut.html|last=Becker|first=Claudia|work=Die Welt|language=German|date=12 August 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper article published at the time stated that the schools they would attend would aim &quot;to mould housewives out of office girls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/10247550/Nazi-Bride-Schools-These-girls-were-the-nucleus-of-the-Reich.html|title=Nazi Bride Schools: 'These girls were the nucleus of the Reich’|last=Rainey|first=Sarah|work=Daily Telegraph|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools for mothers (''Mütterschulen'') were not a new phenomenon in Germany; the first had been established in [[Stuttgart]] in 1917. By 1933 there were 37 such institutions in Germany, aiming to counteract the high infant mortality rate that resulted from the poor diet, bad hygiene and arduous working lives of many women in [[Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DieWelt&quot; /&gt; Housekeeping was a much more complex and labour-intensive task than it is today, with tasks such as cleaning, laying a fire, shopping, cooking and looking after children requiring much more effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; After 1933 the Nazis saw ''Mütterschulen'' as providing not only a way of educating women in housekeeping, but a means of indoctrinating them in Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;DieWelt&quot; /&gt; The administration of the ''Mütterschulen'' was taken over by the NS-Frauenschaft and the [[Deutsches Frauenwerk]] (German Women's Enterprise) and the number of women attending grew rapidly; by 1937, 1.14 million women had participated in over 53,000 courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/alltagsleben/muetterschulen/index.html|title=Mütterschulen im NS-Regime|language=German|publisher=Deutsches Historiches Museum|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Reich Bride School was established in 1937 on [[Schwanenwerder]], an island in the [[Havel]] river in the [[Berlin]] locality of [[Nikolassee]]. It occupied a villa which served as a model household, in which groups of up to twenty young women would live for a six-week course.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot; /&gt; An official pamphlet stated: &quot;In circles of 20 students, young girls should attend courses at the institute, preferably two months before their wedding day, to recuperate spiritually and physically, to forget the daily worries associated with their previous professions, to find the way and to feel the joy for their new lives as wives.&quot; They were charged 135 [[reichsmark]]s (equivalent to about €470 at today's prices) for the course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; Other Reich Bride Schools were soon established; by 1940 there were nine in Berlin alone, and schools were also established in other German cities such as [[Oldenburg]] and [[Tübingen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt;

==Training and indoctrination==

The training given at the schools included a variety of household skills such as cooking, ironing, gardening, child care and animal husbandry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; Even [[interior design]] was addressed; an article in the magazine ''Das schöne Heim'' (&quot;The Beautiful Home&quot;) described how Nazi brides were encouraged to adopt a &quot;clear and clean&quot; interior style in which only &quot;German woods are used in beautiful grain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DieWelt&quot; /&gt; Other topics of study included how to make suitable conversation at cocktail parties, cleaning a husband's uniform and polishing a husband's boots and dagger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot; /&gt; They were also taught German folk songs, legends and fairy tales to infuse them with a sense of &quot;national community&quot; (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;DHM&quot; /&gt; The women were required to pledge to raise their children in accordance with National Socialist beliefs, to be loyal to Hitler throughout their lives and to marry in faux neo-pagan ceremonies led by Nazi Party members, rather than in church. On completion of the course, they were issued with certificates stamped with the [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|''Lebensrune'']] symbolising life; if they dropped out, they were refused permission to marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker&quot; /&gt;

The schools were initially aimed at educating the future wives of the Nazi elite – prominent members of the SS and the Nazi Party. Eventually they were opened to all &quot;racially suitable&quot; German women, thus excluding anyone with Jewish or gypsy heritage, physical disability, or a history of mental illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; Nazi propaganda publicised the schools' activities in articles such as one covering the Oldenburg Reich Bride School, published in May 1940 in the ''[[NS-Frauen-Warte|Frauen Warte]]'', the Nazi Party’s bi-weekly illustrated magazine for women. It showed in a series of photographs how the brides were taught how to use gardening tools, practising cooking and animal husbandry, picking and arranging flowers, and undergoing courses in cooking, sewing, and baby care, knitting and weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/fw8-22b.htm|title=Gelernt ist gelernt: Mit Bildbericht aus der Reichsbräute- und Heimmütterschule Husbäke in Oldenburg|language=German|work=NS Frauen Warte|publisher=Randall Bytwerk, Calvin College|location=Grand Rapids, MI|date=May 1940|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying text, written from the point of view of a mother recalling her time at the Reich Bride School, says:

{{quote|The days were full, the training thorough, and the evenings of reading, singing, and games were delightful. The future families they would have as wives and mothers were always at the center of the programme. That gave the six weeks [of the course] the unity and organization that so pleased the brides, creating that atmosphere of community that would last past the course. The fact that most of the girls were engaged to soldiers at the front strengthened the sense of togetherness, both in good and bad times. How happy the young woman is that she can still be with her husband. She wants to use weeks until he may be called up to build a comfortable home for him and make the few weekend hours he has at home warm and treasured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/fw8-22b.htm|title=An Illustrated Report from the Reich Brides’ and Housewives’ School at Husbäke in Oldenburg|work=NS Frauen Warte|publisher=Randall Bytwerk, Calvin College|location=Grand Rapids, MI|date=May 1940|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Dr Marius Turda of [[Oxford Brookes University]], &quot;the bride schools perfectly illustrate the Nazi regime’s ambition to control its population, both privately and publicly. A good German wife was supposed to be a supportive mother and a promoter of racial values in the family.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; They also represented a political gambit by NS-Frauenschaft leader Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, whose collaboration with Himmler to set up the schools resulted in a politically valuable alliance between her organisation and the SS, a rising power within the Nazi establishment. According to the historian [[Michael Burleigh]], the explicitly faux neo-pagan and anti-Christian stance of the bride schools was particularly noteworthy. Dr Julia Torrie of [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St Thomas University]] in [[New Brunswick]] notes that the underlying theme of the bride schools was that they defined the family as exclusively [[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan]]; as she puts it, &quot;Exercising the kind of domesticity that a woman learnt at an SS bride school was, in a sense, 'living' her Nazism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt;

The Reich Bride Schools continued their activities until at least May 1944, but the pressures of war appear to have curtailed them before the final collapse of Nazi Germany the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; Women took up new roles on the &quot;home front&quot;, working in munitions factories or assisting the military. Although this contradicted the original idea of women being confined to the home, Scholtz-Klink justified it on the grounds that they now had a &quot;higher obligation&quot; that demanded their contributions to the war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;DieWelt&quot; /&gt; After the war, the bride schools fell into obscurity and information about them is still scarce; as Marius Turda puts it, &quot;It is possible that, after the war, former Nazis and their spouses who had graduated were rather reluctant to talk about these schools.&quot; However, in 2013, Nazi-era documentation about the schools was discovered in the German federal archives in [[Koblenz]], including a rule book containing details of the oaths that brides had to swear and the certificates awarded to them at the end of their courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt;

A '''war child''' refers to a child born to a native parent and a parent belonging to a foreign [[military force]] (usually an [[military occupation|occupying force]], but also [[military personnel]] stationed at [[military bases]] on foreign soil). Having a child by a member of a [[belligerent]] force, throughout history and across cultures, is often considered a grave betrayal of social values. Commonly, the native parent (usually a woman) is disowned by family, friends, and society at large. The term &quot;war child&quot; is most commonly used for children born during [[World War II]] and its aftermath, particularly in relation to children born to fathers in German occupying forces in northern Europe. In Norway, there were also ''[[Lebensborn]]'' children.

It is also applied to other situations, such as children born following the widespread rapes during the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]] associated with the war of liberation. The discrimination suffered by the native parent and child in the postwar period did not take into account widespread [[War rape|rapes by occupying forces]], or the relationships women had to form in order to survive the war years.

The following article has extensive coverage of issues in Norway during and after World War II.

==Discrimination==
Children with a parent who was part of an occupying force, or whose parent(s) collaborated with enemy forces, are innocent of any [[war crime]]s committed by parents. Yet these children have often been condemned by descent from the enemy and discriminated against in their society. They also suffer from association with a parent whose war crimes are prosecuted in the postwar years. As such children grew to adolescence and adulthood, many harbored feelings of guilt and shame.

An example are the children born during and after World War II whose fathers were military personnel in regions occupied by [[Nazi-Germany]]. These children claim they lived with their identity in an inner exile until the 1980s, when some of them officially acknowledged their status. In 1987, [[Bente Blehr]] refused anonymity; an interview with her was published in ''Born Guilty'', a collection of 12 interviews with persons whose parent(s) had been associated with German forces in [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]]. The first autobiography by the child of a German occupying soldier and Norwegian mother was ''[[The Boy from Gimle]]'' (1993) by [[Eystein Eggen]]; he dedicated his book to all such children. It was published in Norway.

During and in the aftermath of war, women have historically been censured who have voluntary relationships with military personnel of an occupying force. Women who became pregnant from such unions would often take measures to conceal the father's status.

They commonly chose among the following: 
*Arrange a marriage with a local man, who would take responsibility for the child
*Claim the father was unknown, dead, or had left, and bring up the child as a single mother
*Acknowledge the relation; bring up the child as a single mother
*Acknowledge the relation; accept welfare from the occupying force (see the German [[Lebensborn]])
*Place the child in an orphanage, or give the child up for adoption
*[[Emigrate]] to the occupying country, and claim that identity
*Have an [[abortion]]

After the war, it was common for both mother and child to suffer repercussions from the local population. Such repercussions were widespread throughout Europe. While some women and children suffered torture and deportation, most acts against them fell into one or several of the following categories:

*Name calling: ''German whore'' and ''German kid'' were common labels
*Isolation or harassment from the local community and at schools
*Loss of work
*Shaving the heads of the mothers, which was frequently done in the immediate aftermath of the war
*Temporary placement in confinement or internment camps

While repercussions were most widespread immediately after the war, sentiments against the women and their children lingered into the 1950s, 60s, and beyond.

==War children of World War II==
Estimates of the number of war children fathered by German soldiers during World War II are difficult to gauge. Mothers tended to hide such pregnancies for fear of revenge and reprisal by male family members. Lower estimates range in the hundreds of thousands, while upper estimates are much increased, into the millions.&lt;ref name=drolshaben9&gt;{{citation | first = Ebba D | last = Drolshagen | title = Wehrmachtskinder.

=== Lebensborn program ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-010-11, Schwester in einem Lebensbornheim.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''Lebensborn'' birth house]]
''[[Lebensborn]]'' was one of several programs initiated by the Nazi leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] to try to secure the racial heredity of the [[Third Reich]]. The program mainly served as a welfare institution for parents and children deemed racially valuable, initially, those of SS men. As German forces occupied nations in northern Europe, the organization expanded its program to provide care to suitable women and children, particularly in Norway, where the women were judged suitably Aryan.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In [[Norway]] a local Lebensborn office, ''Abteilung Lebensborn'', was established in 1941 to support children of German soldiers and their Norwegian mothers, pursuant to German law (Hitlers ''Verordnung,'' July 28, 1942). The organization ran several homes where pregnant women could give birth. Facilities also served as permanent homes for eligible women until the end of the war. Additionally, the organization paid child support on behalf of the father, and covered other expenses, including medical bills, dental treatment and transportation.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In total, between 9 and 15 Lebensborn homes were established. Of the estimated 10,000–12,000 children born to Norwegian mothers and German fathers during the war, 8,000 were registered by Abteilung Lebensborn. In 4,000 of these cases, the father is known. The women were encouraged to give the children up for adoption, and many were transferred to Germany, where they were adopted or raised in orphanages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

During and after the war, the Norwegians commonly referred to these children as ''tyskerunger'', translating as &quot;German-kids&quot; or &quot;Kraut kids&quot;, a derogatory term.  As a result of later recognition of their post-war mistreatment, the more diplomatic term ''krigsbarn'' (war-children) came into use and is now the generally accepted form.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== Post-war years ====
As the war ended, the children and their mothers were made outcasts by many among the general populace in formerly occupied countries. They grieved and resented the losses of the war, and everything that had to do with Germany. The children and their mothers were often isolated socially, and many children were bullied by other children, and sometimes by adults, due to their origin.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

For instance, immediately after the peace, 14,000 women were arrested in Norway on suspicion of &quot;collaboration&quot; or association with the enemy; 5,000 were, without any judiciary process, placed in [[forced labor]] camps for a year and a half.&lt;ref name =&quot;Tyskerunger&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1159&amp;a=286209 | language = Swedish | title = &quot;Tyskerunger&quot; tvingades bli sexslavar | first = Anna-Maria | last = Hagerfors | publisher = [[Dagens Nyheter]] | place = SE | date = 2004-07-10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their heads were shaved, and they were beaten and raped.&lt;ref name = &quot;Tyskerunger&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.willy-brandt-stiftung.de/krigsbarn.htm | title = Krigsbarn | publisher = Willy Brandt Stiftung | place = DE | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', war children claim that, while living at an orphanage in [[Bergen]], they were forced as children to parade on the streets so the local population could whip them and spit at them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyskerunger&quot; /&gt;

In a survey conducted by the Norwegian Ministry of Social Affairs in 1945, the local government in one third of the counties expressed an unfavorable view of the war children. The same year the Ministry of Social Affairs briefly explored the possibility of reuniting the children and their mothers with surviving fathers in post-war Germany, but decided against this.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Five hundred children who were still cared for in Lebensborn facilities at the end of the war had to leave as the homes were closed down. Some children were left to state custody, during a time when such care was marked by strict rules, insufficient education, and abuse. Approximately 20 children ended up in a mental institution in 1946, due to lack of space in other institutions and unsuccessful adoption attempts. Some remained there past their 18th birthdays.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Due to the political attitudes prevailing after the end of the war, the Norwegian government made proposals to forcibly deport 8000 children and their mothers to Germany, but there were concerns that the deportees would have no means of livelihood there. Another option was to send them to Sweden. Australia was also considered after the Swedish government declined to accept these people; the Norwegian government later shelved such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landro|first=Jan H.|title=Ville sende alle &quot;tyskerunger&quot; ut av landet|url=http://www.bt.no/kultur/article114048.ece|publisher=[[Bergens Tidende]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=3 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014729/http://www.bt.no/kultur/article114048.ece|archivedate=30 September 2007|date=25 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Financial and legal issues ====
In 1950, diplomatic relations improved so that the Norwegian government was able to collect child support from identified fathers of war children who were living in West Germany and Austria. As of 1953 such payments were made. Child support from fathers living in East Germany was kept in locked accounts until diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1975.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Some of the war children have tried to obtain official recognition for past mistreatment. Supporters claim the discrimination against them equated to an attempt at [[genocide]]. In December 1999, 122 war children filed a claim in the Norwegian courts for the failure of the state to protect them as Norwegian citizens. The case was to test the boundaries of the law; seven persons signed the claim. The courts have ruled such suits as void due to the [[statute of limitations]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The law of Norway allows citizens who have experienced neglect or mistreatment by failure of the state to apply for &quot;simple compensation&quot; (an arrangement that is not subject to the statute of limitations). In July 2004 the government expanded this compensation program to include war children who had experienced lesser difficulties.  The basic compensation rate is set to 20,000 NOK (€2,500 / $3,000) for what Norwegian government terms &quot;mobbing&quot; (bullying). Those who can document other abuse can receive up to 200,000 NOK (25,000 € / $30,000).

On March 8, 2007, 158 war children were to have their case heard at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]].  They demanded reparations of between 500,000 SEK (≈ 431,272 NOK) and 2,000,000 SEK (≈ 1,725,088 NOK) each for systematic abuse. The Norwegian government contested the claim that the children were abused with the consent of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | place = SE | url = http://www.expressen.se/index.jsp?a=901290 | title = Norge ville landsförvisa 9 000 barn | publisher = Expreßen}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 their case before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] was dismissed, but they were each offered a £8,000 token from the Norwegian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Rob|title=The chosen ones: The war children born to Nazi fathers in a sinister eugenics scheme speak out|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-chosen-ones-the-war-children-born-to-nazi-fathers-in-a-sinister-eugenics-scheme-speak-out-771017.html|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=20 Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Andrew|title=Stolen by the Nazis: The tragic tale of 12,000 blue-eyed blond children taken by the SS to create an Aryan super-race|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1111170/Stolen-Nazis-The-tragic-tale-12-000-blue-eyed-blond-children-taken-SS-create-Aryan-super-race.html|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medical experimentation ====
In conjunction with the 1999 claim by the war children, a motion was filed in September 2000 alleging that 10 war children were subject to experiments with [[LSD]] approved by the Norwegian government and financed by the [[CIA]], the American intelligence agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://tux1.aftenposten.no/english/local/d159850.htm | title = War babies died in LSD experiments | newspaper = Aftenposten | date = September 4, 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/02/25/wnor25.xml | title = Norwegian government Commission also concluded that they were unable to find any other evidence in local, national and international archives which could support the allegation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOU33&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=[Final report by Commission] |url=http://odin.dep.no/filarkiv/207798/NOU0303033-TS.pdf |format=PDF |language=Norwegian |date=December 17, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040622150747/http://odin.dep.no/filarkiv/207798/NOU0303033-TS.pdf |archivedate=June 22, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the postwar years, medical staff in several European countries, and the United States, conducted [[clinical trial]]s or experimental treatment involving LSD, most of them at some point between 1950 and 1970. In Norway, trials involved volunteer patients under a protocol after traditional medical treatments had proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOU33&quot;/&gt;

==== Acknowledgment and apology ====
Since the mid-80s, the fate of the war children has become well known in Norway. The government of Norway has acknowledged its neglect of them. The Prime Minister of Norway apologized publicly in his New Year's Eve speech in 2000. As adults, the 150 former Lebensborn Children are suing for reparations and damages from the Norwegian government for failing to protect them and discriminating against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6429565.stm | title = Norway sued by children of Nazis | publisher = BBC | newspaper = News | place = UK | date = March 8, 2007 | first=Steve | last=Rosenberg}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of Norway's war children is [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], the former [[ABBA]] singer. By marriage she is Princess Anni-Frid Reuss of Plauen.

=== Norway ===
German forces invaded Norway in 1940 and [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied the country]] until 1945. At the end of the war, the German forces stood at 372,000. It is estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to Norwegian mothers with German partners during the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Eva | last = Simonsen | title = Into the open – or hidden away?  The construction of war children as a social category in post-war Norway and Germany | publisher = NordEuropaforum | year = 2006 | volume = 2 | pages = 25–49 | url = http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2006-2/simonsen-eva-25/PDF/simonsen.pdf | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Nazi ideology considered Norwegians to be pure [[Aryan race|Aryans]], German authorities did not prohibit soldiers from pursuing relationships with Norwegian women. Their Lebensborn organization encouraged it.

After the war these women especially, but also their children, were mistreated in Norway.

=== Denmark ===
German forces [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied Denmark]] between 1940 and 1945. German soldiers were encouraged to fraternize with Danish women, who were also considered pure Aryan. The government has estimated between 6,000 and 8,000 children were born to Danish mothers with German partners during or just after the occupation. The women were nicknamed &quot;German Girls,&quot; used in a pejorative sense. The Danish government has documented 5,579 such children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Tyskerpiger – under besættelse og retsopgør | origyear = 1994 | year = 1998 | ISBN = 87-00-18184-6 | publisher = Gyldendal, Krigsboern | place = København, DK | format = summary | url = http://www.krigsboern.dk/artikler/anette_warring.htm | language = Danish | trans_title = German Girls during Occupation and Post War Purge | first = Anette | last = Warring}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the Danish government allowed this group access to parenthood archives. They exempted these descendants from the country's normal secrecy period of 80 years for such records.

=== France ===
German soldiers were forbidden from having relationships with French women by the Nazi regime at the beginning of the [[German occupation of France in World War II|Occupation]]. Due to difficulties of enforcement, the military later tolerated fraternization. This was an intermediate situation between the encouragement of similar relationships in Denmark and Norway, and strict prohibition in [[Eastern Europe]]. The different regulations were based on Nazi racial ideology as to which populations they considered racially pure enough as to be desirable for children born to their men.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = article | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3722321.stm | title = Book gives 'Boche babies' a voice | publisher = BBC | newspaper = News | place = UK | date = June 1, 2004 | first=Hugh | last=Schofield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of war children born to French women in France by German soldier fathers in the years 1941–49, is estimated to be 75,000 to 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2009/11/30/01016-20091130ARTFIG00413-200000-enfants-de-soldats-allemands-seraient-nes-en-france-.php Number of war children in Second World War in France from German soldiers and their French girl friends], ''Le Figaro'', 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurentguillet.com/crbst_115.html Armin Hass: &quot;Forschen und versöhnen. Geschichten über Kriegskinder und den verlorenen Großonkel Joseph&quot;, ''Arolser Zeitung'', October 13, 2011. (de) (Number of French war children).]&lt;/ref&gt;
After the expulsion of German troops from France, those women who were known to have had relationships with German soldiers, were arrested, &quot;judged,&quot; and exposed in the streets to public condemnation and attacks. Having their heads shaved in public to mark them was a common punishment.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre (Hrsg.): ''Des fleurs sur les cailloux.'' (Flowers on the pebbles), Editions Laurent Guillet, 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Such descendants have formed a group to represent them, ''Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre.''

=== Finland ===
{{Distinguish2|[[Finnish war children]], children who were evacuated from Finland during World War II}}
During [[Military history of Finland during World War II|the wartime]] and the post-war period, Finnish women gave birth to 468,269 children in [[Finland]] in the period 1940–1945. A small portion, about 1,100 of the children, were fathered by foreign troops. Some 700 children were born to [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers, 200–300 to [[Soviet prisoners of war in Finland|Soviet POWs]], and 100 to [[Swedish Volunteer Corps|Swedish volunteers]]. Depending much on the foreign father's background, most of these children were left fatherless, and some of the mothers, along with their children, faced [[discrimination]] in the Finnish society.&lt;ref name=&quot;westerlund&quot;&gt;[http://www.arkisto.fi/uploads/Palvelut/Julkaisut/Ulkomaalaisten_sotilaiden_lapset_nide1.pdf The Children of German Soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wilms&quot;&gt;[http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/urn_nbn_fi_uef-20100036/urn_nbn_fi_uef-20100036.pdf ”Ryssän heilat ja pikku-Iivanat”] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== German soldiers ====
After the [[Anti-Comintern Pact#Revised pact of 1941|revision of the Anti-Comintern Pact]] in 1941, there were, at best, somewhat 200,000 German soldiers in Finland, the vast majority in the [[Finnish Lapland]], in the period 1941–1944. According to the [[National Archives of Finland]], as many as 3,000 Finnish women, some working for the voluntary auxiliary paramilitary organisation [[Lotta Svärd]] and some for the [[Wehrmacht]], had relationships with German soldiers. An estimated 700 children were born to German soldiers in Finland, and were mostly unplanned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svt.se/nyheter/uutiset/saksalaissotilaiden-lapset-uskaltavat-vihdoin-astua-esiin Saksalaissotilaiden lapset uskaltavat vihdoin astua esiin] {{fi icon}} SVT.se&lt;/ref&gt; Many German soldiers were aware of [[safe sex]] and the Wehrmacht kept them well-equipped with [[condom]]s, which has been estimated to effectively keep a relatively low impregnation rate for the Finnish women who had sexual intercourse with German soldiers. A booklet published by the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]] in 1943, ''Der deutsche Soldat und die Frau aus fremdem Volkstum'', allowed German soldiers to marry those Finnish women who can be considered to represent the &quot;[[Aryan race]],&quot; hinting that there was some uncertainty among Nazi authorities about ethnic [[Finns]]' &quot;[[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|genetic suitability]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;westerlund&quot; /&gt;

Finland was a [[Co-belligerence|co-belligerent]] (1941–44) of Germany until the beginning of the [[Lapland War]] (1944–45), a war fought between Germany and Finland. Alone in the fall of 1944, during the Lapland War, some 1,000 Finnish women, two-thirds of them aging from 17 to 24, left the country and stood with German soldiers. The reasons for leaving the country with the enemy varied, but the most common reason was a relationship with a German soldier. Subsequently, most of these women returned to Finland, as their presence was commonly unwelcomed and some facing mistreatment, such as [[forced labor]], in their new abode in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2013100117552623_uu.shtml Uutuuskirja: Saksalaisten sotilaiden mukaan lähteneillä naisilla karujakin kohtaloita] {{fi icon}} Iltalehti.fi&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, most of the Finnish mothers that had children with German soldiers were left as single parents. Some of these children got adopted by the Finnish men who married the children's mothers.

Some Finnish women who were associated with German soldiers faced discrimination in the Finnish society. The discrimination was not generally as harsh as other European women experienced elsewhere for the same reason, mostly due to the thought of &quot;Finnish-German brotherhood-in-arms&quot; during the co-belligerence and that those countries shared a mutual enemy, the [[Soviet Union]], whose some [[Soviet prisoners of war in Finland|POWs captured by the Finns]] were also intimately involved with Finnish women, which was considered much more forbidden (see the [[#Soviet prisoners of war|section below]]). Also the children fathered by German soldiers encountered discrimination in their youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilms&quot; /&gt;

==== Soviet prisoners of war ====
During the wartime, there were about 69,700 [[Soviet prisoners of war in Finland|Soviet POWs in Finland]], of which 5,700 were taken in the [[Winter War]] (1939–40) and 64,000 in the [[Continuation War]] (1941–44). Some POWs' living conditions were relatively good, as, at best, some 15,000 of them were placed on farms, where they were used as forced labor, usually working rather freely together with Finnish civilians. Some of these POWs had relationships with Finnish women. An estimated 600 Finnish women had relationships with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] POWs, and 200–300 children were born to POWs and Finnish women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/vintti/yle.fi/tv1/juttuarkisto/tasta-puhutaan/matka-isan-luo.html Matka isän luo] {{fi icon}} Yle.fi&lt;/ref&gt; These women's backgrounds varied: some were unmarried, while others were widowed by the war. Some relationships were adulterous, as some of the women were married to Finnish soldiers who were absent at the time. The usage of condoms was scarce, partially due to the lack of their availability to POWs, and partially due to the lack of Finnish rural women's awareness of the condom usage. After the [[Moscow Armistice]], Finland started to return the surviving POWs to the Soviet Union, and most of the Finnish mothers that had children with POWs were left as single parents. Some of the mothers married Finnish men afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;westerlund&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wilms&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkisto.fi/uploads/Palvelut/Julkaisut/Ulkomaalaisten_sotilaiden_lapset_nide2.pdf The Children of Foreign Soldiers in Finland, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Poland and Occupied Soviet Karelia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships with ethnic [[Russians|Russian]] POWs especially were highly disapproved in the Finnish society, much more than the relationships with German soldiers and with other POWs from other ethnic groups, such as [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] POWs. A strong background factor for this hatred was the long-lasting [[Anti-Russian sentiment#Finland|anti-Russian sentiment in Finland]] (''ryssäviha'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]). Some women's [[Head shaving#Prison and punishment|heads were shaved]] for allegedly having relationships with POWs. Pejorative terms such as ''ryssän heila'' (''ryssä's girlfriend'', the word ''[[ryssä]]'' being a common Finnish slur for a Russian) and ''ryssän huora'' (''ryssä's whore'') were widely used. The children fathered by Soviet POWs also faced discrimination in their youth, such as bullying in school.&lt;ref name=&quot;westerlund&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wilms&quot; /&gt;

==== Swedish volunteers ====
Overall there were about 11,000 [[Swedish Volunteer Corps|Swedish volunteers]] who fought for Finland at some point during the wartime. During the Winter War, [[Swedish Volunteer Corps (Winter War)|Swedish volunteers numbered 9,640]] and during the Continuation war, there were [[Continuation War#International volunteers and support|over 1,600 Swedish volunteers]], of which about a third had previously participated in the Winter War. About 100 children were born to Finnish women and Swedish volunteers. Often these women moved to [[Sweden]] with their children.

=== Greece ===
Little is known about the Greek Wehrmacht children, since it is still an issue surrounded by tabboo in Greece, but Greek children of Wehrmacht soldiers are known to have been subjected to public humiliation. Frequently, they heard shouts on the street that they have a Wehrmacht father, or as they were called «Germanobastardos» (Greek for &quot;German bastard&quot;). The mothers were discriminated against as well and the children suffered because of the stigmatized mother and the frequently unknown father. Quite often, the mothers blamed the children for their bad situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = article | url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/131767/article/ekathimerini/life/the-children-of-the-wehrmacht | title = The children of the Wehrmacht | publisher = Expatica | date = September 9, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There's no official figure on their numbers, but researchers estimate that at least 200. The low number, some authors argue, was due that only a small proportion of pregnancies resulted in births on fears of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = article | url = http://ethniko.net/blog/wehrmachtskinder-griechenland-wehrmacht-children-in-greece/ | title = The forgotten Wehrmacht children in Greece | publisher = Ethniko.net | date = July 22, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions were easily accessible in Greece at that time and the Orthodox Church either played a part in imposing the silence or helped women get abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = article | url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/38395/article/ekathimerini/news/seeking-the-children-of-the-wehrmacht | title = Seeking the ‘children of the Wehrmacht’ | publisher = Stavros Tzimas | date = February 25, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
The Nazis considered the women of the [[Netherlands]] to be Aryan and acceptable for fraternization by German soldiers. The [[NIOD|Dutch Institute for War Documentation]] originally estimated that around 10,000 children by German fathers were born to Dutch mothers during the occupation. However, recent figures, based on newly available records at the archives of the German Wehrmacht (name of the German armed forces from 1935–45), indicate that the true number could be as high as 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = article | url = http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=8000 | title = German soldiers 'fathered 50,000 Dutch children' | publisher = Expatica | date = May 28, 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war children==

===Fathered by Allied Forces in Germany===
German historians in a book &quot;Bankerte!&quot; (&quot;Bastards, the children of occupation in Germany after 1945&quot;) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campus.de/buecher-campus-verlag/wissenschaft/geschichte/bankerte-9692.html  &quot;Bankerte!&quot; Besatzungskinder in Deutschland nach 1945 ]&lt;/ref&gt; found that at least 400,000 children were fathered by occupying soldiers, with at least 300,000 of those children fathered by Soviet fathers. The researchers concluded that at least two million rapes were committed by Soviet Red Army soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/troops-fathered-400000-children-in-post-war-germany/a-18237282 Germany Troops fathered 400,000 children in post-war Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied forces [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupied Germany]] for several years after World War II.  The book ''GIs and Fräuleins'', by Maria Hohn, documents 66,000 children as born with fathers who were soldiers of Allied forces in the period 1945–55:

*American parent: 36,334
*French parent: 10,188
*British parent: 8,397
*Soviet parent: 3,105
*Belgian parent: 1,767
*Other/unknown: 6,829

==== American ====
According to Perry Biddiscombe,&lt;ref name = &quot;Biddiscombe&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_3_34/ai_72412197/pg_1 | title = Dangerous Liaisons: The Anti-Fraternization Movement In The U.S. Occupation Zones Of Germany And Austria, 1945–1948 | first = Perry | last = Biddiscombe | journal = Journal of Social History | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | year = 2001 | pages = 611–47 | doi=10.1353/jsh.2001.0002}}{{Dead link| date= March 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; more than 37,000 illegitimate children were sired by American fathers in the 10 years following the German surrender. Locals generally disapproved of any relations between the occupation forces and German and Austrian women. Not only were the Americans the recent enemy, but the residents feared the American fathers would abandon the mothers and children to be cared for by the local communities, which were severely impoverished after the war. A majority of the 37,000 illegitimate children ended up as wards of the social services for at least some time. Many of the children remained wards of the state for a long time, especially children of African-American fathers. The mixed-race children, called &quot;brown children&quot;, were seldom adopted in what was then a more homogeneous country. Arrangements were made for some such children to be adopted by African-American couples or families in the United States.

The food situation in occupied Germany was initially very dire. By the spring of 1946, the official ration in the US zone was no more than 1275 calories per day (much less than the minimum required to maintain health), with some areas probably receiving as little as 700.  Some US soldiers exploited this desperate situation to their advantage, using their ample supply of food and cigarettes (the currency of the [[black market]]) as what became known as &quot;frau bait&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 25 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each side viewed the other as the enemy, but exchanged food for sex anyway.&lt;ref name= &quot;Biddiscombe&quot; /&gt;
The often destitute mothers of the resulting children usually received no [[alimony]].

Between 1950 and 1955, the [[Allied High Commission]] for Germany prohibited &quot;proceedings to establish paternity or liability for maintenance of children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,456835,00.html | title = Children of the Enemy | author1-link = Mary Wiltenburg | first1 = Mary | last1 = Wiltenburg | first2 = Marc | last2 = Widmann | newspaper = [[Der Spiegel]] | origyear = 2006 | issue = 52 | date = 2007-01-02 | place = DE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the lifting of the ban, West German courts had little power to gain child support from American soldiers.

The children of black American soldiers, commonly called ''Negermischlinge'' (&quot;Negro half-breeds&quot;), were particularly disadvantaged. Even in the cases where the soldier wanted to marry the mother of his child, he was prevented by the US Army. It prohibited interracial marriages until 1948, when the Army was integrated by Executive Order of President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel&quot; /&gt;

In the earliest stages of the occupation, US soldiers were not allowed to pay maintenance for children they admitted having fathered. The military prohibited this as &quot;aiding the enemy&quot;. Marriages between white US soldiers and Austrian women were prohibited until January 1946, and with German women until December 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biddiscombe&quot; /&gt;

The official US policy on war children was summed up in the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' on 8 April 1946, in the article &quot;Pregnant Frauleins Are Warned!&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Girls who are expecting a child fathered by an American soldier will be provided with no assistance by the American Army... If the soldier denies paternity, no further action will be undertaken other than to merely inform the woman of this fact. She is to be advised to seek help from a German or Austrian welfare organization. If the soldier is already in the United States, his address is not to be communicated to the woman in question, the soldier may be honorably discharged from the army and his demobilization will in no way be delayed. Claims for child support from unmarried German and Austrian mothers will not be recognized. If the soldier voluntarily acknowledges paternity, he is to provide for the woman in an appropriate manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biddiscombe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== British ====
{{See also|British Forces Germany|British Army of the Rhine}}
British troops also occupied a portion of what later was organized as [[West Germany]]. Fraternisation between soldiers and local German women was discouraged by British authorities because of the status of Germans as the enemy during the war. The British government did not allow its citizens to marry German nationals until the 1960s. In recent times, especially since the later years of the [[Cold War]], such marriages have become more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'British' Germans the war left behind|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15737185|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable children of British servicemen and German mothers include [[Lewis Holtby]], [[Kevin Kerr (footballer born 1989)|Kevin Kerr]], [[Maik Taylor]] and [[David McAllister]].

==== Canadian ====
Canada declared war on Germany in 1939, following Britain's war declaration the week before. [[Canada in the World Wars and Interwar Years|During the war]] Canadian forces participated in the Allied invasions of both Italy and Normandy. Before the invasion of continental Europe, a significant number of Canadian forces were stationed in Britain.

An estimated 22,000 children were born to British mothers and Canadian soldiers stationed in Britain. In continental Europe, it has been estimated that 6,000 were born to Canadian fathers in the Netherlands, with smaller numbers born in Belgium and other places where Canadian forces were stationed during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = article | url = http://www.vancourier.com/issues02/123202/news/123202nn1.html | title = Where's Daddy | newspaper = Vancouver Courier | date = August 5, 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous example is [[Eric Clapton]].

===In the following countries===

====Netherlands====
On [[liberty|liberation]], many Dutch women welcomed the Allied troops and had relationships that resulted in babies; these were called 'Liberation babies'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/pr/pr050505-redirected | title = Welcome the heroes | publisher = Radio Netherlands}}.{{Dead link|2011-7-23|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that about 4,000 &quot;liberation babies&quot; were fathered by Canadian soldiers before they left the area in early 1946.

====Austria====
In Austria, war children („Russenkind“) by known Russian fathers of the occupation were discriminated against, as were their mothers.

The Austrians also resented women who had relations with American soldiers, calling them 'Yanks' chicks' (»Amischickse«) or 'Dollar sluts' (»Dollarflitscherl«) and, in the case of those who had relations with black soldiers, 'chocolate girl' (»Schokoladenmädchen«).&lt;ref name=&quot;zeit&quot;&gt;{{citation | language = German | place = DE | url = http://www.zeit.de/2010/52/A-Mischlingskinder?page=all | first = Niko | last = Wahl | title = Heim ins Land der Väter | trans_title = Home to fathers' country | newspaper = Zeit | date = December 23, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1946, the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' newspaper warned &quot;pregnant Fräuleins&quot; that military authorities would provide no assistance to them or their children if the fathers were US soldiers. The paper said that a &quot;&quot;[[Strength Through Joy]]&quot; girl who ate from the forbidden fruit should accept the consequences,&quot; referring to a Nazi slogan.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeit&quot; /&gt;

In coordination with American groups, an Austrian welfare program was started after the war to send the mixed-race children of Austrian/African-American parents to the United States for adoption by African-American families. The children by then ranged in age from 4 to 7 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeit&quot; /&gt;

==Amerasians==
{{Main article|Amerasian}}
Probably more than 100,000 children have been born to Asian mothers and U.S. servicemen in [[Asia]]. This occurred chiefly during [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. Children fathered by U.S. servicemen were also born to mothers [[rape]]d by men living on several U.S. military bases in the region since World War II. These children are known as ''[[Amerasian]]s'', a term coined by the author [[Pearl S. Buck]].

Numerous Asian-European children were also born during the colonial years of the British, French, and Dutch administrations in [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

==Cases of rape==
Numerous war children were born as the result of their mothers being raped by enemy forces during World War II. Rape of conquered women has been practiced in numerous other conflicts, including in Africa, especially during the longstanding wars in the Congo and Sudan, for instance.

===Former Yugoslavia===
In the 1990s organizations were formed to classify such violence against women as among the prosecutable [[war crimes]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. Some Muslim women in [[Bosnia]] who were raped in Serbian camps were aided by humanitarian organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Stiglmayer (Hg.), ''Massenvergewaltigung. Krieg gegen die Frauen'', Frankfurt a. M. (Fischer) 1993, p. 154-174; ISBN 3-596-12175-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation of mothers, war children and fathers==

===Prevention===
The recognition in 1989 that violence against women in the form of rape was a deliberate military strategy and [[human rights]] abuse led to the approval of an international [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. Since 2008, the [[United Nations Security Council]] bans sexual violations, defining them as a war crime. The German weekly ''[[Die Zeit]]'' described this action as an historical milestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.zeit.de/2008/27/01-Gewalt | newspaper = Die Zeit | place = DE | language = German | year = 2008 | title = Eine historische Tat}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration===
One author suggested that adoption and assimilation of a child into a new family might be a solution to prevent war children from growing up as unwanted and mobbed by people in a hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.dna.fr/articles/200808/24/rosette-illegitime,colmar,000009277.php | title = Die akzeptierte‚ illegitime‘ Rosette | language = German | date = 2008-08-24| publisher = DNA | place = FR}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of the number of births of such children suggest this is impractical.

===War children's ignorance of origins===
Often the war children never understood the reason for being isolated. They did not learn their father's identities until late in life or by chance:
* by comments of their class mates, relatives or neighbours
* when they needed official documents e. g. [[family register]], or
* after their mothers died.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cailloux&quot;&gt;{{citation | language = French | editor = Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre (Hrsg.) | title = Des fleurs sur les cailloux. Les enfants de la Guerre se racontent | publisher = Editions Laurent Guillet | place = Limerzel | year = 2010 | ISBN = 978-2-918588-01-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |120,128,148,162,177}}

In most cases, when war children tried to learn identities of their biological fathers years later, the searches were usually difficult and often in vain.

===Fathers unknown===
Occupation forces after WWII strictly interdicted [[fraternization]] by military personnel with people of the occupied territories. Couples who became involved tried to hide their relation because of these interdictions and the resentment and disapproval by the occupied population. Fathers of war children were generally excepted from civil actions by mothers to claim alimony or child support.

Communication with the mothers of war children often ceased when the soldiers suddenly were reassigned, often without time to say good bye. Some of the soldiers were killed in action. In the post-war period, soldier fathers were prevented by conditions from returning to their former girl friends and war children even if they wanted to. Others had surviving wives and families to return to at home, and denied having war children. In some cases, they never knew they had sired children when serving abroad.&lt;ref&gt;(de) [http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2010/0505/seite3/0001/index.html Thorsten Knuf: &quot;Kinder des Krieges&quot;], ''Berliner Zeitung,'' 5 May 2010, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mothers traumatized===
At the end of war, mothers with war children were prosecuted as criminals and punished in humiliating ways for their relations with the enemy. They were isolated socially and economically. Many of them could only rehabilitate and become respected by marrying a fellow countryman. Long-term persecution of a former girlfriend of a German soldier is documented in a book by ANEG; she says that she was traumatized for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cailloux&quot; /&gt;{{rp |35–52}}

Some of the mothers gave their war child to a home of public welfare. Others tried to care for the child with their new partner and their common children ([[step family]]).  Some of the mothers died during the war.

==Children in search for their fathers==
A network of European war children, &quot;Born of War — international network,&quot; was founded in October 2005. They meet every year in Berlin to assist each other, make decisions about searching for parents, and find out new positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.bowin.eu | title = Born of War – international network | place = EU}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Searches by war children of World War II===

====Changing opinions====
Since the late 20th century, as they reach retirement age, many war children from World War II have begun to search for their full identity and their roots. The legal children of a German father may also be interested in contacting the previously unknown war child of their father, if they know one or more exists. Public opinion has become more compassionate toward the past generation of war children. Few of the biological fathers are still alive. Subject to bullying and humiliation, many of the mothers never told their children about their foreign fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2010/0505/seite3/0001/ | place = Berlin, DE | author=Thorsten Knuf |title =  Kinder des Krieges | newspaper = Berliner Zeitung | date = 5 May 2010 | at = S.3 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
The government has advised that persons trying to do research should gather the complete birth documents, including the birth certificate (not only parts of it). The Norwegian archive at Victoria Terrasse in Oslo burned down in the 1950s, and many of these important documents were lost. The Norwegian Red Cross has some records. It is often easier to trace the Norwegian mother first by Church records.

====Belgium====
The government and researches recommend that persons search for documentary evidence from Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt, Auslandsorganisation – Amt für Volkswohlfahrt und Winterhilfswerk (1941–1944) about alimony payments. Old photographs with greetings on the back or private letters may provide clues to a father's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Dutch | place = BE | publisher = Archief Democratie | url = http://www.archief-democratie.be/node/25 | title = Typical documents to begin the search}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
Since 2005 the society, ''Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre'' (ANEG), has worked in both France and Germany to help descendants of parents of mixed nationalities, whether a German father in France or French father in occupied Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://anegfrance.free.fr/ | title = ANEG | trans_title = French society of war children | language = French | place = FR}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cœurs Sans Frontières/Herzen ohne Grenzen'' (Hearts without Frontiers) is another French organization supporting the search for family members of French children whose fathers were German soldiers during the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | trans_title = Hearts without borders | url = http://www.coeurssansfrontieres.com/ | language = French | title = Cœurs Sans Frontières/Herzen ohne Grenzen | place = FR}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
Mixed children of white German women and Black WWI soldiers were called &quot;[[Rhineland Bastards]]&quot;. This phrase, along with many other racial epithets, reinforced the ideology that Black men were/are beasts and don't care for their children. The &quot;Brown Babies&quot; became an international concern, with Black American Press publicizing and advertising for adoptions. There was an emphasis in Germany and the U.S. on skin color (note: Brown Babies rather than orphan). This is because skin color excludes children from German nation identity, and it allows them to belong to U.S. This creed lived in both nations, as Brown Babies who were adopted in the U.S. were forbidden from speaking German. This was among the efforts to erase an entire generation of Afro-Germans.

Since 2009 the German government has granted German citizenship on application when documented by war children born in France to French mothers, by German soldier fathers in WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = German | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hTwYEhELpH0tnrDGb20py3tXVNXA | publisher = AFP | title = Französische Wehrmachtskinder begrüßen Doppelnationalität}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = German | publisher = ZDF | date = August 5, 2009 &lt;!--21h45–22h15--&gt; | title = Heute-journal}}: report of granting German nationality to French children, descendants from German soldiers who were stationed in World War II in France.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Search in German Archives====
Several central files are part of the German archives:
* At [[Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt)]], military movements of German soldiers of World War II can be traced. Children in search of their German fathers (soldiers, prisoners of Second World War) may find some clues here. 
* [[German Federal Archives-Military Archives]] (in German: Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv) in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] has some copies of personal documents. For each unit of the former Wehrmacht, it has the so-called &quot;Kriegstagebücher&quot; (reports of daily events) where movements, and losses per day and unit were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = German | url = https://www.bundesarchiv.de/bundesarchiv/dienstorte/freiburg/ | publisher = German Federal Archives | place = Freiburg im Breisgau | title = Military Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Archives of former [[Berlin Document Center]] contained details on personal membership in Nazi party and organisations of the German Third Reich. These archives were transferred to [[German Federal Archives]], branch Berlin-Lichterfelde. Search for persons concerned are possible 30 years after death. Details needed are name, prename, date of birth, as well as occupation and range of activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = German | url = https://www.bundesarchiv.de/bundesarchiv/dienstorte/berlin_lichterfelde/ | publisher = German Federal Archives | place = Berlin-Lichterfelde | title = Nazi membership}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge]] has a direct access file, with a searchable online database, of all known German war graves of World War I and II.&lt;ref&gt;(de) [http://www.volksbund.de/graebersuche.html Online search for individual German war graves], Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war children===
Post-war war children often search in vain: their knowledge of their father's personal data may be vague, some archives are closed, and data has been lost.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spiegel&quot; /&gt;

====Search for US fathers====
War children by American soldiers may gain assistance in their search by the organization GITrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gitrace.org/ | title = gitrace}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = German | place = DE | url = http://www.besatzungsvaeter.de/ | title = Besatzungsvaeter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 the German-based association, GI Babies Germany e.V., also assists in the search for the roots of children of German mothers and GIs in the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gi-babies-germany.de (de/en) GI Babies Germany e.V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Search for Canadian fathers====
Organization Canadian Roots UK helps war children in Great Britain to trace a Canadian father. Vice versa it helps Canadian veteran fathers to trace a child born in the UK during or shortly after WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.canadianrootsuk.org/ | title = Canadian Roots | place = UK}}: Internet site assisting war Children from Canadian fathers in Great Britain during and after World War II in their search.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological assistance==
Psychological assistance and help to find lost family members by publishing on the Internet is granted by the German association, &quot;kriegskind.de e. V.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.kriegskind.de/ | language = German | title = Kriegskind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA)''' also known as the '''Civil Affairs Holding and Staging Area''' was a combined [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Navy|U.S Navy]] military formation authorized by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] on June 18, 1944 during [[World War II|World War Two]] for [[Military occupation|military government]] theater planning, training and provision of military government personnel to areas of the [[Far East]] liberated from the [[Empire of Japan]], including [[East China]], [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist11&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; CASA had two divisions:  The Operations and Training Division focused on language instruction and execution of civil affairs duties at a local level.  These duties varied greatly and, as an example, included mass feeding of civilians, camp sanitation, provision of medical supplies, containment of epidemic diseases, labor relations and rodent control. The Theatre Planning &amp; Research Division developed plans for military government at a national level such as control of Japan's economic institutions,  control of Japan's education system and methods for increasing the overall supply of food throughout, not only Japan, but also previously occupied areas like [[East China]]. CASA provided comprehensive training and planning in [[civil affairs]] administration to officers coming from six schools of military government established at various universities throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist23&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;    Army &amp; Navy personnel trained by CASA numbered in the thousands, with more than 1,000 officers assigned to a wide variety of civil affairs positions&lt;ref name=&quot;williams&quot;&gt;Williams p.411&lt;/ref&gt;  for the initial [[occupation of Japan]] alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takemae&quot;&gt;Takemae&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of the U.S. Army's Civil Affairs Division in the creation of CASA was to replicate the same success in the Far East experienced by the Civil Affairs Division in the [[European Theater of Operations United States Army|European Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhistc&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; [[John H. Hilldring|General John H. Hilldring]] ordered Colonel [[Hardy Cross Dillard|Hardy C. Dillard]], Commander of the Civil Affairs Training Division for the [[European Theater of Operations United States Army|European Theater of Operations]], to take command of CASA from [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] William A. Boekel and implement the European Civil Affair's planning and training program.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhiste&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Dillard was relieved of command on 20 July 1945 by [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Percy L. Sadler.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhiste&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background of Civil Affairs planning for the Far East ==

=== The China-Burma-India Theater ===

Shortly after the establishment of a Civil Affairs Division in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in March 1943, a circular letter was sent to the commanding generals of all theaters offering the services of the Civil Affairs Division and of trained Civil Affairs officers. In response to a request from the Commanding General, United States Army Forces, [[China-Burma-India Theater|China Burma India Theatre]], Colonel William A. Boekel and Colonel (then Lt. Colonel) Mitchell Jenkins were ordered to [[New Delhi]], where they arrived 4 May and 14 May respectively. Their first month was spent familiarizing themselves with the general situation in the countries of [[Southeast Asia]]. The American Civil Affairs officers received the distinct impression that the British officers regarded [[Burma]] and other British territory as definitely a British Civil Affairs area, with which the Americans should have no concern. As a result of policy conferences, this attitude was translated into a formal statement of basic policy, approved by American and British headquarters. Once established, this policy left American Civil Affairs officers no function except that of liaison with British agencie&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist1&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Boekel and Lt. Colonel Jenkins continued their studies of the countries of [[Southeast Asia]], as well as the question of United States Civil Affairs activities in [[Japan]] proper, [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Manchukuo]].  Their work resulted in the formulation of certain tentative plans for the military government of [[Japan]], and for the procurement, training and organization of Civil Affairs officers for the Far East. Their conclusions were embodied in a series of letters, of 26 August, 19 October, and 6 November 1943. The recommendations contained in these letters were approved by the Commanding General, China Burma India Theater, and transmitted by him to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. In the preparation of the last two letters, assistance was given by Mr. John Davies, Political Adviser to Lieutenant [[Joseph Stilwell|General Joseph W. Stillwell]], and by Mr. Monroe Kail, member of the American Mission in [[New Delhi]]. Both of these gentlemen concurred fully with the plans and recommendations contained in the letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist2&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Aerial View of Barracks at Presidio of Monterey.png|thumb|350px |left| Aerial view of barracks occupied by soldiers and sailors of the Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA) at the Presidio of Monterey during the Spring of 1945.]]

=== The Civil Affairs Division - War Department ===

Colonel Boekel was ordered, December 1943 to duty with the [[History of civil affairs in the United States Armed Forces|Civil affairs Division]] at Washington, although he was technically still assigned to Headquarters, USAF (United States Army Forces), [[China Burma India Theater|CBI]] Theater. Upon reporting to Major General [[John H. Hilldring]], Commander, Civil Affairs Division, Colonel Boekel was directed to assist the General in Civil Affairs planning and training for the Far East. The Civil Affairs Division directed its primary effort toward procuring a [[United States Department of State|State Department]], War Department (Operations Division); and [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] declaration of policy with respect to United States Civil Affairs administration in the Far East. Such a statement was dependent, in large measure, upon certain long-range policy decisions within the State Department. General Hilldring wrote to the Chief, Naval Office for Occupied Areas, 25 January 1944:&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist3&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;It is anticipated that at an early date the State Department will issue written decisions of policy defining the current and postwar interests of the American Government in the above referred to areas. Upon receipt thereof, appropriate directives will be issued to the several military commanders in these areas... No definitive statement has thus far been made by the Army with reference to [[Korea]] and [[Manchukuo]] because the question as to whether or not there will be American participation in the administration of these areas is one which still awaits State Department determination.&quot;

The Civil Affairs Division's project, that of bringing together the various agencies involved in arriving at a joint decision, progressed satisfactorily.  After four months in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Colonel Boekel was able to report that,&quot;On 13 May 1944 J,C,S.. Paper 819/2 was issued by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|J.C.S.]] approving certain basic assumptions for Civil Affairs planning purposes for specific areas in the Far East and Pacific Ocean. This Paper is substantially responsive to the inquiries and policy recommendations made by the Commanding General, USAF (United States Army Forces), [[China Burma India Theater]] in his letters to the War Department dated respectively 26 August, 19 October, and 8 November, 1943. The Paper as approved by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] embodies the composite views of the Office of the [[United States Assistant Secretary of War|Assistant Secretary of War]], the State Department, the Civil Affairs Division (CAD) and of the U.S. Navy, and was 'sweated' through twenty-one drafts. General Hilldring regards the paper as of primary importance in that it gives initial direction and impetus to Civil Affairs &quot;planning.&quot;  In addition to policy planning, the Civil Affairs Division was concerned with plans for the procurement, training and organization of Civil Affairs officers for the Far East. As early as January 1944, it was reported to General Hilldring that, &quot;the program is well under way for the training of 1500 officers for use in the operational and administrative functions.&quot; The Navy was invited to participate in the Army-training program as well as in the subsequent Civil Affairs administration of [[Japan]] to the extent of twenty-five per-cent of the personnel required.  This invitation was confirmed later in papers of 10 December and 22 December 1943.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist4&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial planning at the School of Military Government ===

The procurement of fifteen hundred officers for Civil Affairs work in the Far East was provided for in War Department Circular No. 136, 8 April 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist5&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The first exclusively Far Eastern class at the School of Military Government, Charlottesville, Virginia, opened 12 June 1944 at the [University of Virginia]. While the Civil Affairs Division in Washington was busy coordinating the planning activities of the numerous agencies concerned with Civil Affairs, the School of Military Government in Charlottesville, VA was developing an informal Civil Affairs Planning Staff. Colonel Boekel wrote to General Ferris, 23 January 1944, that he would be in Charlottesville to interview 4 officers 'earmarked' for Asiatic Theater duty and to lay the foundation for the organization of the nucleus planning staff, which initially consisted of 4 Army and 3 Navy officers.  A week later, Colonel Boekel wrote, that An embryonic planning section had been set up at the School of Military Government in Charlottesville,VA consisting of five U.S. Army and three U.S. Navy officers and that Lt. Col Arthur Dobson was tentatively earmarked for General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer|Albert Wedemeyer]] but was to be retained at the School of Military Government pending determination of the larger question of policy as to the extent of participation in [[South East Asia Command|SEAC]] (South East Asia Command). Colonel Boekel summarized personnel in the initial planning group as follows:

Dillard  (center) stands to the left of CASA Deputy Commander -  Navy Captain William S. Veeder and alongside other senior Army /  Navy officers. Under a [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] directive, CASA was created as a combined [[United States Army|Army]] / [[United States Navy|Navy]] formation with Army personnel comprising 75% of all personnel.]]

*Majors Faxon, Hudson and Dapert originally designated for assignment to the [[China Burma India Theater]]  were held at the School of Military Government (SOMG) pending the determination of other policy questions. 
*[[Major (United States)|Major]] Isaacs was selected out of a group of 11 as an additional planner. Major Isaacs was born in Japan, speaks Japanese and is a successful [[San Francisco]] fisheries expert.
* Senior Surgeon - William W. Nesbitt.
*[[Lieutenant commander|Lt. Comdr.]] Robert T. Secrest - a graduate of the Navy Military Government School and of the Wimbledon Military Government School.
*[[Second lieutenant|Lt.]] Warren S. Hunsberger - a learned and accomplished economist.

The planning section completed and maintained a current and basic Military Government plan for Japan Proper and its personnel were added to from time to time in the ratio of 75% Army and 25% Navy.  According to Colonel Boekel in a letter to Colonel Jenkins dated 14 April 1944, the informal planning group at the SMG (School of Military Government) was, &quot;involved in some very rough spade work in anticipation of what the several theater commanders or Navy Area Commanders may require to complete their planning when a directive is issued to them.&quot; Colonel Boekel noted that the theater commanders would not be bound by anything planned by the Far East initial planning group at the SMG (School of Military Government). The group, according to Colonel Boekel, served best as the focus for the procurement of survey data from the dozen or more federal agencies charged with the responsibility of getting out handbooks and guides for specific areas.

=== Planning for a Civil Affairs Holding and Staging Area ===

Planning for the establishment of a Civil Affairs Holding and Staging Area is first mentioned in a memorandum of Colonel Boekel's, written 15 January 1944, in preparation for a discussion with Colonel David Marcus, relative to planning for Civil affairs administration in the [[Far East]]. It was Colonel Boekel's opinion that, &quot;As soon as the American (Army and Navy) officers and enlisted men personnel are trained, they should be organized into teams or provisional units with appropriate T/O's (tables of organization) and moved to [[Hawaii]] for final integration with the Theater Headquarters Planning Staff.  The facilities of the [[University of Hawaii]] may be available.  There the personnel should be broken up into teams for special areas and be ready to take over any thereof as the military situation requires.  If there is to be [[United Kingdom|British]] participation, the amalgamation thereof with the Americans should take place in Hawaii or the final Theater School and Staging Area.  The Asiatic Theater Commander has already stated that for logistical and other reasons, the staff could not be trained in [[India]] and introduced into Japan via the [[The Hump|Himalayan hump]]; nor over the [[Burma Road]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist9&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In furtherance of the plan to establish the Holding and Staging Area in Hawaii, Colonel Boekel conferred with Captain Mercer- Secretary to [[Chester W. Nimitz|Admiral Nimitz]], 10 March 1944. [[File:Presidio Main Gate - Spring 1945.PNG|thumb|300px |left|A sentry stands at the main gate to the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]] in the Spring of 1945. The Presidio of Monterey was reactivated in January 1945 to accommodate the Civil Affairs Staging Area.]]Captain Mercer stated that the Navy would be opposed to the immediate reception and quartering of any large number of Civil Affairs officers in [[Hawaii]], because of the paucity of shipping space, subsistence and quarters. He indicated, however, that the Navy would give a sympathetic reception to the 'survey' committee which is to go to Hawaii from Civil Affairs Division and Captain Pence's office, particularly if the proposal is based upon a progressive transfer starting with a small number on or about 1 June and continuing through the ensuing period of CATS (Civil Affairs Training Schools).  Colonel Boekel also reported that during the previous week he had a conference with Captain Moore of [[Robert C. Richardson, Jr.|Lt. General Richardson's]] staff.  Captain Moore indicated that there would be no difficulty in transferring the Planning Section and successive increments of CATS (Civil Affairs Training Schools) to Hawaii.  Colonel Boekel went to Hawaii in May 1944 to confer directly with [[Chester W. Nimitz|Admiral Chester W. Nimitz]], Commander of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] and [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]], and with [[Robert C. Richardson, Jr.|Lt. General Richardson]], Commanding General, United States Army Forces, Central Pacific Area concerning the site of the Holding and Staging Area about to be established. The decision arrived at as a result of this conference was that it would be impractical to locate the Holding and Staging Area in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist10&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The search for a site was then transferred to the west coast of continental United States. A committee from Washington, composed of Colonel Boekel, Colonel Harry Jones, Chief of the Personnel and Training Branch, Civil affairs Division, and Colonel H. E. Robison, of the [[United States Army Provost Marshal General|Provost Marshal General's Office]], visited several potential sites in [[California]]. They inspected [[Camp McQuaide]] at [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]; the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]; [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale]], at Sacramento; and [[Fort Ord]], at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. Their choice fell upon the last named site. The formal establishment of the holding and staging area is referred to in a Joint [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chiefs of Staff document]].

By War Department directives dated 18 and 29 June 1944 a Civil Affairs Holding and Staging Area (CASA) has been established at [[Fort Ord]], California effective as of 15 July 1944 as a special activity under the Director, Civil Affairs Division, War Department Special Staff, to be administered by the [[Army Service Forces|Ninth Service Command]]. At CASA the officer graduates of the School of Military Government (SMG)  and Civil Affairs Training School (CATS) will be processed for overseas service in the Far East and will be given special area indoctrination and orientation. It is anticipated that CinCPOA (Commander in Chief Pacific Ocean Areas) and the CG (Commanding General), Central Pacific Command will furnish liaison officers to CASA in order to assure that the operation of CASA will be consistent with the requirements of CinCPOA and CPA (Commander Pacific Area).&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist11&quot;&gt;Army Hist.

=== Establishment of CASA at Fort Ord ===

At the time of the arrival of the advance party at Fort Ord, 15 July 1944, there was still some uncertainty as to which buildings would be assigned to CASA. After an inspection of the available buildings in the 17AC area, as well as other available troop quarters, a message was sent to the [[Army Service Forces|Ninth Service Command]] at [[Fort Douglas]], and confirmation received, of the assignment to CASA of the WAC (Warfare Area Commander) area. This consisted of the administration building, a mess hall and three barracks. One additional building was still occupied by WAC personnel. The space assigned as regarded as adequate for the initial group of about one hundred officers and twenty-eight enlisted men on a single-cot basis, and provided, in addition a room for assembly, research and conference purposes. The Civil Affairs Staging Area, [[Fort Ord]], California, was activated 15 July 1944, by CASA General Order No 1, which also announced Colonel Boekel's assumption of command as Acting [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist13&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CASA advanced party ====

The immediate task of the advance party, in preparation for the arrival of the first contingent, 1 August, was that of cleaning and equipping the assigned buildings. In order to fit the physical facilities for efficient use, there was also considerable minor carpentry, plumbing, signal and engineering work to be done, as well as Quartermaster and Commissary supplies to be drawn. As a result of strenuous work by the members of the advance party, carried out over long hours, the physical task of moving in was completed by Saturday evening, 22 July 1944. On the following Monday morning, a field ration mess was opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist14&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movement of CASA to Presidio of Monterey ===

[[File:Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA) Soldiers March to the Field.PNG|thumb|300px |right|Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA) soldiers at the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]] march to the field in Spring of 1945.]]
CASA personnel strength showed little growth from the time of activation of Civil affairs Holding and Staging, Area to the end of the year, five months later.  The arrival of eight hundred seventy-six (876) Navy [[Enlisted rank|enlisted men]], plus additional Army and Navy officers, during the last days of the calendar year brought the total strength to one thousand one hundred twenty-four (1,124). Considerable additional growth was presaged by the increasing numbers of Army and Navy officers in Civil Affairs Training Schools at six universities.This rapid increase of CASA personnel had already put considerable pressure on the physical facilities assigned to CASA by the Ninth Service Command.  As early as September 1944, Commander Dillard wrote, that &quot;It is important that we immediately freeze space either here or at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] in anticipation of future needs&quot; Continuing studies of space needs occupied the attention of the command staff. Colonel Jenkins, the Executive Officer, reported to the Commanding Officer, 14 November 1944, as follows, &quot;On the basis that- we may not be able to have The Presidio at Monterrey and must stay here, I have again made a survey of East Garrison of Fort Ord.  Just in case we cannot get additional space in the Main Garrison beyond what has now been allocated to us and CAD (Civil Affairs Division) insists that we must care for more than 1200 bodies, which as I wrote you is the maximum that our present space can accommodate. Under these circumstances, East Garrison would be our only alternative. It will take care of us, but I hope we will not have to go there.&quot;  Colonel Harry P. Jones, Chief of Personnel and Training Branch, CAD (Civil Affairs Division), replied to the above memorandum that the original authority to locate at Fort Ord provided for freezing space for 1625 men and officers.  He added that a new request was being submitted, increasing the number to be provided for up to 3000, and including a paragraph to the effect that if Fort Ord, Main Garrison is not available, the Presidio of Monterey would be made available.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist23&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The Commanding Officer stated, in response to Colonel Jones' letter, that, &quot;There has never been any question of lack of accommodations at [[Fort Ord]]. The only question is, ''where'' in Fort Ord. Ground Forces are freezing, from Washington a steadily increasing amount of space in Main Garrison. Every indication pointed to a growing monopoly which, unchecked; would have split us between Main Garrison and East Garrison or even pushed us over to East Garrison.&quot; The Civil Affairs Division, War Department, then recommended that a survey be made of the facilities of Camp Beale in order to compare them with those of East Garrison. In the memorandum reporting this comparison the Commanding Officer expressed his judgment that, &quot;East Garrison, while less desirable than Main Garrison or the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]], is much more desirable in every respect than [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale]].&quot; He stated also that Colonel Jenkins, Executive Officer, and Major Dickey, Chief of POR Branch of S-3, concurred with him in this judgment. Colonel Dillard maintained that, &quot;It would be impossible to secure a better location for CASA than the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterrey]].&quot;The primary obstacle to be overcome in securing the Presidio of Monterey for CASA was the fact that this permanent installation had been inactivated. The War Department was experiencing considerable pressure to inactivate more installations, as the result of large scale shipments of personnel to overseas duty. To reactivate the Presidio of Monterrey was indeed a difficult task. The difficulties were eventually overcome, however, and Colonel Dillard was able to write on, 24 January 1945 that, &quot;Upon my return from a trip to San Francisco and Shoemaker I learned the welcome news that the Presidio of Monterrey had been procured for us.&quot; War Department Circular No. 4-0, dated 1 February 1945, and General Order No 12 Headquarters, Ninth Service Command, 10 formally placed the Presidio of Monterey in active status, effective 18 January 1945 and established the Civil Affairs Holding and Staging area as an activity of the Presidio, effective 10 February 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist25&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 1, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations and Training Division ==

=== Physical Processing and Training Branch ===

[[File:Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA) M3 Submachine Gun.PNG|thumb|300px|right|CASA soldiers train with the [[M3 submachine gun|M3A1 submachine gun.]]]]

The organization and functions of the Physical Processing and Training Branch of the Operations Division (S3) included:
*Training Group A
*#Instruction in small arms
*#Conduct of ranges
*Training Group B
*#Field Training in subjects such as booby traps, land mines, camouflage, hand grenades, infiltration, slit trench, fox hole preparation, landing net, amphibious operations, chemical warfare, use of field equipment, tent pitching, hikes and assistance in the conduct of [[Military camp|bivouacs]].
*Training Group C
*# Physical conditioning, construction and maintenance of facilities, demonstrations and classes in Judo and general hand-to-hand combat. 
*Training Group D
*# First echelon maintenance and operation of motor vehicles (classes), and conduct of examinations for motor vehicle operators' permits.
The advance party devoted most of its time during the second week at CASA to planning the details of the training program which began immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist55&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unit Training Branch ===

The mission of the Unit Training Branch was to train military government units for the successful completion of any Military Government mission in the field, or for any specific Military Government mission assigned by a Theater Commander.

==== Planning Section ====

The planning section included plans on courses, field problems, panels, demonstrations; estimates of supply and transport needed to execute plans and the supervision of execution needed to complete the plans. The planning section also included the provision of administrative assistants to execute unit training programs as assigned, to revise programs in the light of operation experience, to complete staff work submitted by the Problem Planning Section, to submit original oral or written memoranda for the unit training problems and programs, to undertake the planning and execution of special programs required by higher authority on short notice and to check all Field and Military Government problems with provision headquarters and appropriate functional specialists.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist58&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civilian camp layout ====

A full size civilian camp for displaced persons, occupying approximately ten acres was staked out and outlined in white tape on the Presidio of Monterrey. The camp layout was based on a recommended plan submitted to the Headquarters from the Theater.....Barbed wire fences, sanitary facilities and typical sections of barracks and other buildings were constructed in the area - with detachments participating in the construction.  It was anticipated that the camp would make field problems relating to camps take on a more realistic aspect in addition to the training aid, which the actual layout would provide.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist61&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Civilian Camp Layout for Dispaced Persons at the Civil Affairs Staging Area.PNG|thumb|300px |left|CASA soldiers, using white tape, outline a camp for displaced civilians. The camp was ten acres in size.]]

==== Civilian camp layout models ====

During the summer of 1945, several paper and plaster models of hilly terrain were provided, also small models of buildings, sanitary facilities, water tanks, etc.  Training groups were then given the opportunity to set up a model civilian camp.  Each of these camp layouts was photographed, as the basis for a team contest to see which group could set up the best camp. Considerable interest was aroused by this realistic approach to a practical problem.

=== Information and Indoctrination Branch ===

The mission of the Information and Indoctrination Branch was to disseminate general information which would be useful to Military Government officers in the field, provide speakers with Far Eastern experience instructional films, the organization of educational panels, to secure education pamphlets and similar materials,  prepare and supervise a weekly &quot;convocation&quot; or assembly, to procure and project film for all divisions of CASA, and to install and operate a public address system for all divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist62&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language Branch ===

Language work was initially included in the Interior Training Section of the Planning, Processing and Training Branch, Functional Division, with Major Wilbur L. Williams, CMP, as Section Chief. There were two language supervisors, 1st Lt Harold K. Brown, INF, and 1st Lt Suyeki Okumura, INF. Instruction was carried on initially by five enlisted instructors of Japanese ancestry, S/Sgt Hironobu Hino, T/4 Randolph K. Inoue, T/4 Clarence M. Kimura, S/Sgt Masaru Nakagawa, and S/Sgt Paul J. Sakai, The Divisional reorganization at CASA of 22 November 1944 set up a separate Language Section, with Major Myron I. Barker, AUS, as Chief of Section, and 1st Lt. Suyeki Okumura, INF, as Assistant Chief. Two additional Japanese language informants arrived at the end of December, and fifteen more arrived 5 January 1945, bringing the total to twenty-two. In February, eleven Navy officers were assigned to the Language Section for duty. They constituted a research and production unit. Each officer was given a definite project, and attached to him was a group of informants who worked closely with him. Two more informants were added to the group in March.  By 20 July, the end of the first year of CASA, the total number of informants stood at thirty-nine.  The number of classes in Japanese language was slightly more than fifty, and the number of classes in the Chinese language was fourteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist69&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the first month of Japanese language instruction, the officers in charge of the program, 1st Lt Harold K. Brown, INF, and 1st Lt. Suyeki Okumura, INF, made a report to the Commanding Officer. They mentioned certain problems which had become apparent during the course of the month. For one thing, the instructors had not received any teaching materials from Military Intelligence School, Camp Savage, Minnesota, from which all of them had come. For reasons of security, they had been asked to turn in all their language materials before they left, but were promised that materials would be shipped as soon as requested by proper authority. Request had been made, but no materials had arrived. Another problem was created by the different systems of spelling used, (Hepburn and Block-Kennedy) some of the officers having been trained in one system and some in the other. This difficulty was met by mimeographing all teaching materials in both systems. One paragraph of this report is of special interest.

[[File:Chinese Language Training at CASA.PNG|thumb|300px |left | Madam Ling - fu Yang, formerly curator of the National Museum-[[Beijing|Peking]], gives CASA officers [[Chinese language]] instruction.]]

{{quotation | &quot;In comparing the enlisted instructors at CASA. to the civilian instructors at the Civil Affairs Training Schools, it is felt that the enlisted men are more desirable, during this phase of the officers' training,  in view of the fact that they are able to present, as a result of their training, a much more military aspect of the language. This, too, tends to make the language training more realistic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist64&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
A difficult situation was created by the wide variation in language experience and previous training of the officers at CASA, The report mentioned above, points out that there were four distinct groups, for each of which a distinct type of language work had to be provided. These groups were:

==== University of Chicago - Class 1 ====

Approximately three months of training which was presented differently from the training given to Class II at the same school. In addition to this difference in training, these officers had served in the field for three months, immediately prior to assignment at CASA, during which time, the majority had lost all contact with the language. Some instruction had been received in reading and writing.

==== University of Chicago - Class 2 ====

Seven and one-half months of training in the language, with no loss of contact prior to assignment at CASA. Elementary training in reading and writing and use of the dictionary.

==== University of Virginia Group ====

Approximately three months of training at the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia. During this training, ''Naganuma's Standard Reader'' was used as a text, and the officers were learning to read and write simultaneously while learning to speak the language.

==== Beginners Group ====

Officers with no previous training in the language, and Navy officers who had received very little training at the Navy School at Columbia University.

==== Observations by Commander Boekel ====

An interesting and significant observation of the language experience of the officers was made by the Acting Commanding Officer, Colonel Boekel, in his weekly report to the Commander, Civil Affairs Division (CAD), dated 25 August 1944. He wrote,&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist65&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;I have made it a practice, whenever possible, to audit the language refresher conferences being conducted here under the supervision of the five language sergeants. I derived the very clear impression that the practical vocabularies of the CASA Officers and their ability to weave the spoken words into a simple sentence structure were woefully inadequate. I gained the impression too that the vocabulary thus far achieved had to do principally with the ordinary amenities of gracious living and that no special effort had been made thus far to teach Civil Affairs officers a vocabulary and language structure which would enable them to make practical applications thereof in simple Civil Affairs tasks. Motivated by the foregoing impressions, we prepared a questionnaire. Today one hour was devoted to the procurement of ninety-one (91) CASA officers' self-evaluation of their Area E linguistic ability. In addition, the five sergeant language instructors were directed to regard themselves as the average CASA linguist and, without consultation with each other, to furnish a rating of the average CASA officer in the same questionnaire...the more significant facts brought out in the questionnaire. The officers in rating themselves claimed a vocabulary which averaged 704 words, and asserted their ability to use 208 words fluently, 275 words fairly well and 192 with difficulty. The Japanese sergeant instructors, in rating the average CASA. officers, gave them credit for the retention of a 204 word vocabulary of which they could use 97 fluently, 70 fairly well, and 82 with difficulty. The answers to interrogatory 4 in the questionnaire (i.e., the Civil Affairs problem) indicate that 71% of the officers consider that they are not sufficiently qualified in the use of the language to accomplish the Civil Affairs mission therein stated. If of this percentage figure there is added the qualified &quot;yes&quot; answers, then only seven (7) officers or approximately 8% themselves equal to the questionnaire language task and 92% are unqualified. Four of the sergeant instructors stated emphatically and one of them qualified that the average CASA officer would not be able to handle the language part of the Civil Affairs mission in question. The instructors had been working with these officers for only two weeks and therefore their basis for judgment was perhaps not sufficient. As to the method of instruction at CATS (Civil Affairs Training Schools), the preponderant opinion seems to be that more emphasis should be placed on conversation and drill in the actual vocabulary required for the accomplishment of the Civil Affairs mission.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist67&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps in part as a result of this investigation, vocabularies and drill materials developed at CASA did emphasize the use of Civil Affairs situations, and were therefore realistic and practical. A large amount of such material was developed at CASA.

Language work was initially included in the Interior Training Section of the Planning, Processing and Training Branch, Functional Division, with Major Wilbur L. Williams, CMP, as Section Chief. There were two language supervisors, 1st Lt Harold K. Brown, INF, and 1st Lt Suyeki Okumura, INF. Instruction was carried on initially by five enlisted instructors of Japanese ancestry, S/Sgt Hironobu Hino, T/4 Randolph K. Ideue, T/4 Clarence M. Kimura, S/Sgt Masaru Nakagawa, and S/Sgt Paul J. Sakai,&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist68&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The Divisional reorganization of 22 November 1944 set up separate Language Section, with Major Myron I. Barker, AUS, as Chief of Section, and 1st Lt Suyeki Okumura, INF, as Assistant Chief.Two additional Japanese language informants arrived at the end of December, and fifteen more arrived 5 January 1945, bringing the total to twenty-two. In February, eleven Navy officers were assigned to the Language Section for duty. They constituted a research and production unit. Each officer was given a definite project, and attached to him was a group of informants who worked closely with him.  Two more informants were added to the group in March.  3.  By 20 July, the end of the first year of CASA, the total number of informants stood at thirty-nine, the number of classes in Japanese language; was slightly more than fifty, and the number of classes in the Chinese language was fourteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist69&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Japanese Language Training at CASA.PNG|thumb|300px |left| CASA officers receive [[Japanese language|Japanese]] instruction from a language sergeant.]]

The Language Branch rendered service to other CASA activities by providing translators, chosen from its staff of Nisei informants, insofar as this could be done without interfering with the instructional program. These translators were of special value to the CASA Outpost of the Office of Strategic Services, and to the research Group of S-5 in connection with the writing of 
Military Government handbooks and manuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist63&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Japanese language instruction ====

The officers studying [[Japanese language|Japanese]] were organized into small groups, and met with the [[Japanese American|Japanese-American]] enlisted instructors two hours each day, five days a week. Relatively little emphasis was placed on reading and writing the Japanese language. The primary concern was to develop facility in the use of the spoken language. Much attention was given to the development of mimeographed language materials (dialogues, conversations, etc.) dealing specifically with 
Military Government situations.

==== Chinese language instruction ====

The classes in Chinese language were developed primarily because of the possibility that CASA might be called upon to, send Civil Affairs officers to the Theater for use in [[Taiwan|Formosa]] or on the [[China]] coast. A few officers who had some experience in the use of spoken [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese (Mandarin)]] were called upon to serve as instructors. Madame Ling-fu Yang, formerly curator of the National Museum, [[Beijing|Peking]] became an instructor in this department, and conducted additional classes for the CASA officers who were acting as instructors.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist69&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instruction Branch (Functional Training) ===

Functional training was concerned with the preparation of officers for the many specialized functions performed by Civil Affairs/Military Government. Training of this nature was carried on from the beginning. At first, however, it was so closely integrated with Theater Survey and Planning that no separate branch or section was established for it. When an S-5 Division was created, in December 1944, functional training was declared to be the primary mission of the new division. It was not until 3 March 1945 that functional training was transferred to the S-3 or &quot;Training&quot; Division.  Special Order No 38, 6 March, assigned personnel to the &quot;Functional Training Branch&quot; of the S-3 Division. The name of the Branch was changed, 10 April, to 'Instruction Branch&quot; at the same time that its responsibilities were expanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist70&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==== General Administration Section ====

Officers in the General Administration Section studied the governments of the area at the national, prefecture, city, village and township levels.

==== Public Safety Section ====

Students in the Public Safety Section concentrated on the public safety operations of the area including: police, fire and civilian defense. Arrangements were made with the Chief of Police, San Francisco, and with the Warden of [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] Prison, to send groups of CASA Public Safety Officers to the San Francisco Bay area for training in their specialty.

==== Legal and Property Control Section ====

Officers in the Legal and Property Control Section studied the laws and machinery for the administration of justice in the area and in addition, property control.

==== Agricultural, Fishing Section ====

Curriculum consisted of a course in Oriental Agriculture, given at the [[University of California, Davis|University of California College of Agriculture]] at Davis.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist77&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; and courses of instruction in Japanese agriculture at CASA. Field trips were taken to [[Biggs, California|Biggs]], California, to study USDA Rice Experiment Station; to Sacramento, California, to inspect the Bercut-Richards Canning Factory, which packed fruit for the Armed Forces and the F.H. Woodruff &amp; sons Seed Company plant, packaging vegetable seeds for foreign shipment; to the Delta Area of California, south of Sacramento, to study fruit and vegetable production and the handling of Japanese labor; and to the California Agricultural. Exp. Station Orchard in [[Winters, California|Winters]], California, where subtropical fruits were observed and studied on the tree. Stops were made at [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]] to inspect the Basic Products Company, onion dehydrating plant; and at Berkeley, to study hydroponics (water culture of plants) in the U.S. Army Air Forces Laboratory.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist80&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economics and Labor Section ====

Officers in the Economics and Labor Section studied economics in its different ramifications including agriculture, fisheries, communications, public works and utilities, transportation, industry and resources, and labor relations.

==== Fiscal Section ====

Training curriculum included mechanisms of banking, public finance and currency control involved in the liberated area.

==== Engineering Section ====

Training Curriculum included coursework in public works, transportation, utilities and communications.  Additional training was conducted at Camp Parks, California, Navy Construction Battalion station.  Arrangements were made through the Military Government Liaison Officer, Twelfth Naval District, San Francisco. First contingent of officers reported to [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks]] 4 March 1945.  Subject matter included: Seabee administration, history and advanced base policy. Functional components included: cargo stowage; mosquito control; camp sanitation - including drainage; water purification; refrigeration equipment and native materials. These subjects were presented by class lectures, motion pictures and field demonstrations.

[[File:Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA) Mess Supervisors.PNG|thumb|300px |right| A CASA officer addresses a sergeant during training for mess supervisors.]]

==== Mess Supervisors Section ====

The coursework for Mess Supervisors covered several areas that had an immediate impact on civilian sustenance:
*Civilian Camp Feeding: Civilian camp feeding instruction included: improvisation of field cooking facilities,  preparation of [[Asian cuisine|Oriental foods]] and dishes of minimum subsistence diet, sanitation, food handling, food distribution, control and storage of food. Preparation of dehydrated foods.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist77&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mass Feedings: Organization, administration and supervision of civilian mass feedings. Organization, administration and supervision of officers and enlisted men's mess. Inventory, control and requisition. Food preparation. 
*Civilian Welfare: Organization and delivery of essential civilian commodities. 
*Related Functions: Camp maintenance. General sanitary policies. Organization of civilian groups for feeding and other purposes. Improvising of shelter. 
*Related Training:
*#A six-day course at the School for Bakers and Cooks, covering preparation of dehydrated foods, improvising of field facilities, field sanitation, minimum subsistence diet and food storage. 
*#Instruction by officers -in-charge of CASA messing included study of mess hall operations, analysis of personnel functions, planning of menus and preparation of food. 
*#Field trips and exercises including: improvising of facilities and actual direction of enlisted personnel in preparation of a camp diet. 
*#Meetings with various staff members acquainted with camp operation and oriental feeding habits.

==== Sanitary Section ====

A training section in Sanitation, under the Surgeon, was originated in early January 1945, when Capt. W.D. Sheets,  reported for duty.  Water treating equipment and other sanitary equipment and supplies were immediately ordered.  During January the Sanitary Demonstration area, lectures and training films were utilized in the training program, since no other training aids were available. With the removal of CASA to the Presidio, early in February, use of the Fort Ord Sanitary Demonstration Area was eliminated.  By the latter part of February, three other Sanitary Officers had reported for duty, Majors Milton O Lee and Howard E. Dorst, and Capt. W.R. Bradlee.  The training program was then organized with four hours of instruction in water sanitation (Capt. Sheets), two hours in waste disposal(Capt.Bradlee), four hours in food sanitation (Maj. Lee), four hours in insect and rodent control (Maj. Dorst), and four hours in field sanitation by all of the above officers.  Major Dorst, the senior officer, was designated Chief of Section, and Capt. Sheets continued as Property Officer.  As more training equipment was received, floor space available in the Dispensary became inadequate and the Sanitary Training Section was moved to larger quarters in Building 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist82&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Sanitary Demonstration Area =====

A new Sanitary Demonstration Area was constructed at the Presidio of Monterey, at first by officer trainees, and later be enlisted men and prisoners of war. This area contained about forty appliances, and was completely constructed from salvage material, except for cement, with about 1500 man hours of labor.  A practice construction area ordered the permanent installations.  During training a number of these appliances were in operation. To inaugurate the Area, all of the Headquarters Staff was conducted on a tour in late May.  Food was prepared on the field ranges and the noon meal was served in the field, mess gear was washed and waste disposal carried out in the field incinerators. 
[[File:Civil Affairs Staging Area Training at Camp Parks, CA..PNG|thumb|300px |left|CASA officers receive training at a processing plant located off the Presidio of Monterey post.

== Theater Planning and Research Division ==

=== Internal Affairs Branch ===

==== Governmental Organization and Administration Section ====

The work of the Governmental Organization and Administration Section began in May 1945 with an analysis of the various Ministries of Japan's government. The group made suggestions with regard to Military Government organization for Japan at the national level. It drew up plans for the Ministries subsection and for the Legislative subsection, Military Government, Japan. It developed and printed a ''&quot;Military Government Functional Chart&quot;'' which shows the progressive stages of Military Government by functions, the availability of native governmental organizations for administration and recommendations for their use.  It prepared draft copies of directives for Military Government, Japan. In June the group began preliminary studies of and an outline for a Manual on Military Government, Japan.

==== Public Health Section ====

The Public Health Section prepared a list and a map showing location of hospitals and other medical facilities in Japan, and a list of medical personnel in Japan. It also brought out a functional chart for Public Health. It outlined and began work on a Technical Manual. It made a listing of basic drugs to supplement the CAD Medical Units, a flow chart of Medical supplies and the draft of a nutrition plan for Japan.

==== Public Welfare Section ====

The Public Welfare Section prepared a list of projects as a guide for its own activities. This list was superseded almost immediately by a new list of projects received from higher authority. The projects listed were charts of the Japanese Welfare Ministry, objectives and policies of Military Government public welfare work (also to be put into chart form), directives and proclamations, and a series of forms and records.

==== Education Section ====

The Education Section prepared a series of memoranda including immediate objectives of the Education Section, Japan, long range plans for education, administrative organization, and staff requirements in headquarters and in the field. The group undertook the collection of a large number of Japanese school textbooks and of other works on education in Japan. The Chief of Section spent five weeks visiting major educational institutions on the Pacific Coast, collecting Japanese textbooks and other materials, and interviewing persons who had some personal experience with education in Japan. The group secured the services of translators who began the translation of the more important of the textbooks. Two additional memoranda were written; a suggested editorial policy for the revision of Japanese textbooks and a proposal that Katakana be adopted as the official language.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist120&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public Safety Section ====

The Public Safety section prepared a ''Standing Operating Procedure for Public Safety, Japan''. It made a government vehicle survey, Japan. It also studied opium and other narcotic controls. The Fire subsection made a survey of fire protection methods in Japan, and studied the water system and firefighting equipment of Japan.

==== Counter Intelligence Section ====

In addition to the usual tasks performed by all branches and sections, the Counter Intelligence Section carried on research on Japanese associations and societies, and on subversive individuals.

[[File:CASA Soldiers Planting Oriental Vegetables.PNG|thumb|300px |left| CASA soldiers and sailors plant [[Daikon]] and other oriental vegetables in the CASA garden]]

=== Finance Branch ===

The Finance Branch initiated and forwarded a request to the Treasury Department, Washington, for data on property in [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Formosa]] and [[Manchukuo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist121b&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supply Branch ===

It was the function of the Supply Branch to consolidate and revise the T/0 and E's (table of organization and equipment) submitted to it by all the other branches and sections of the Planning Staff.  It also prepared a plan for overall Theater supply procedures -  Military Government, Japan.

=== Economics Branch ===

The Economics Branch included a large number of sections, subsections, units, and produced a considerable quantity of material of a research and survey nature and also a series of plans for the control of Japan's economic institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist121b&quot;/&gt;
[[File:CASA Grown Oriental Vegetables.PNG|thumb|300px |left| Oriental vegetables grown in the garden at CASA.]]

==== Agricultural Section ====

Among many other items, the Section produced a memorandum of basic policies and activities considered essential to maximizing the availability of supplies of food in Japan, a study of Japanese agriculture and related problems, a systematic digest of Japanese agricultural agencies, channels of authority and functions of various units, a study of land tenure in relation to farm labor, a study on problems of increasing agricultural production, an outline of policies plans, procedure, etc., with reference to land reclamation, and a study of the organization and operation of the Ministry of Agriculture. In addition to its work on Japanese agriculture, the Section did considerable work of highly classified nature on agricultural problems of the East China Coast. This was based on the assumption that S-5(planning) might be charged with the responsibility for planning Military Government operations for this area.

=== Transportation and Communications Branch ===

One of the projects proposed by the Water Transportation Subsection and approved by the Steering Committee was that of surveying port petroleum problems. This study had three parts. 
*Port petroleum problems in general, and specific problems in the United States, as a background for the work on Japan 
*Port petroleum problems of Japan
*The development of plans for Military Government Port petroleum administration - Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist122&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal Branch ===

The Legal Branch prepared a series of overlay maps showing the location of various types of courts and penal institutions in Japan. Its primary efforts were devoted to the study of the Ministry of Justice. The group prepared a chart of the organization and bureaus 
of the Ministry. It undertook a detailed study of the functions of the Ministry, and prepared the outline of a plan for Military Government supervision of the Ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist117&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Works and Utilities Branch ===

The Public Works and Utilities Branch prepared a draft memorandum on the scope and principal functions of the electric power and water utilities of Japan. It initiated a population study of each of the forty-six prefectures and of two hundred municipalities of Japan with the object of determining the utilities requirements of Japan, In July 1945 the group began to compile an index of the water works of Japan.

=== Research Branch ===

==== Prefecture Manuals (Research Unit #1) ====

Research Unit#1 operated over a longer period of time with a much larger staff than any other research group. Its objective was to produce an informational volume, covering a great many aspects of Japanese life, on each of the forty-six prefectures of Japan.

The number of pages in each completed volume varied from 125 to 335 with an approximate average of 175 pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist123&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of research necessary to secure adequate information for the writing of these volumes was enormous. The cooperation of OSS/Casa Outpost enabled the Research Group to secure access to materials drawn from all over the United States, and even from foreign countries. Translation facilities of OSS were provided, as were also the facilities of the translation pool of the Japanese Language School, University of Michigan, and the translation pool. Provost Marshal General's Office, Washington. Work on the manuals was delayed by the inability of the Research Staff to secure the services of an adequate number of typists. References to this difficulty are repeated many times in the weekly reports of the division. Finally, when a deadline was set, it became necessary to transfer typists from other activities, and of course, for everyone to work under considerable pressure. By 20 July,  7 of the manuals had been completed and sent to OSS/San Francisco for off-set printing. Even a cursory examination of the completed prefectural manuals shows that the Group did a highly commendable job. Most of the members of the research group were not trained in research. They had to work under pressure and do all kinds of work, even to editing and proofreading, and in some cases, typing. The completed volumes probably contain more information about Japan than is to be found in any other single source in the English language.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist124&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finance Group (Research Unit #2) ====

The Finance Group requested, during the week prior to 1 June 1945, that they be authorized to initiate a project which developed into a technical manual named '' A Manual on the Administration of Japanese Public and Private Finance'' The request for authorization was approved by the Steering Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist125&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The outline of the volume was as follows:

Like the prefectural manuals, the above work required a tremendous amount of research, which, in turn, necessitated the procurement of documentary material from many outside sources.  The completed volume of 550 pages is probably the most complete source of financial information on Japan that is available in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist126&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA) Theatre Planning Officers Review Study Material.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA) officers in the Research Section of the Theater Planning &amp; Research Division, review material.]]

==== Government Group (Research Unit #3) ====

The Government research group was absorbed into the planning section on Governmental Organization and Administration, and the two groups worked as one. For this reason, there are no separate reports on the work of Research Unit #3.

==== Public Relations Group (Research Unit #4) ====

This project began in March 1945 as an effort to explain something of the psychology of the Japanese people with the objective of using this psychology in connection with Military Government control of civilians. The title of the project, as originally stated, was:, ''Field Techniques of Japanese Civilian Control''. The group was, however, reorganized, the title and outline changed, and the work became a ''Handbook on Japanese Behavior and Customs'' By the latter part of July 1945 the volume was completed in rough draft form, preparatory to editing and revision.

==== Public Health Group (Research Unit #5) ====

The main efforts of the Public Health Research Group were devoted to the compilation of a ''Japanese-English Medical Vocabulary and Phrase book'' The vocabulary items to be used were first selected by a group of medical officers assigned to this group. The English terms were then translated into Japanese by the Japanese language instructors at CASA.

==== Agricultural Research Group - Japan and China Coast (Research Unit #6) ====

The agricultural research group, like the Government research group, worked with its section of the planning staff so completely that little distinction is possible.  It spent considerable time studying the fruit and vegetable production of Japan, the forests and forest products of Japan, and undertook a classified study of food supplies and agriculture on the [[East China]] Coast.  The East China Coast study included such items as problems of an adequate supply of protein foods, problems of administration, food storage, currency, price control, rationing, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist128&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Special investigations ====

At the request of the Theater, Major Irwin M. Isaacs carried on two investigations. 
# To determine the type of equipment required for processing the [[offal]] fish and to determine the availability of fish reduction plants with a capacity of one and two tons per hour.
# To secure technical information on soap plants in the Pacific area, with a view to finding the type of plants suitable for making soap from the oils of copra and vegetable products.

== Office of Strategic Services (OSS) CASA Outpost ==

=== Establishment ===

The Office of Strategic Services established an Outpost at the Civil Affairs Holding and Staging Area, Fort Ord, California, effective 1 February 1945. This activity was established as the result of a request made by the Director, Civil Affairs Division, Washington, to(then) Brigadier General [[William J. Donovan|William Donovan]]  Director, [[Office of Strategic Services]]. The request had its origin in the desire of [[John H. Hilldring|Major General Hilldring]], Director, CAD (Civil Affairs Division), to duplicate for the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] the successful work of the OSS at Shrivenham, England, in helping plan for Military Government in the [[European Theater of Operations United States Army|European Theater]] The understanding arrived at between the OSS and the Civil Affairs Division included the following salient points:&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist150&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 3, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;
*The OSS Outpost detachment was to be composed of personnel and facilities exclusively from the agency's Research and Analysis Branch.
*The primary function of the Outpost was to provide expert consultation service in its work with the Planning and Research Division (S-5), CASA. A secondary function was to serve the CASA divisions and activities with intelligence materials and staff to the extent that time would permit. 
*In addition to permanent staff members, OSS was to rotate highly specialized personnel when CASA and OSS programs would benefit and when demands upon OSS by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] would permit such rotation. 
*Physical facilities such as office space, equipment and supplies, etc. were to be provided by CASA, as well as quarters and post privileges comparable to those accorded officers. 
*The Outpost was to have independent status and was to report its activities directly to OSS/Washington.

=== Personnel ===

The OSS personnel who served at the CASA Outpost were specialists in various professional fields.  The permanent staff was selected to provide a wide range of such specialties, and consultants who were brought in from time to time were also selected for their specialized knowledge.  The staff and consultants included Army, Navy, Marine Corps officers and civilian personnel.

Vol. 3, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functions ===

The functions of the Outpost fell into three broad categories:
*The Prefectural Project
*Consultation on Planning
*Miscellaneous Functions

==== The Prefectural Project ====

CASA early conceived the idea of producing an intelligence manual for each of the [[Prefectures of Japan|Japanese prefectures]]. The purpose of the manual was to provide the military government officer with a single volume of information, not elsewhere available in organized form, of a local and regional nature. OSS was asked to provide research materials of a classified nature, expert direction and supervision of research methods and techniques, and final editing and approval of each manual. In addition, a map packet was to constitute an integral part of each manual. Each map-packet was to contain 20 to 30 maps selected by OSS, covering the prefecture and its parts, and was also to include a map made especially for Military Government. OSS was to procure maps already produced from its own collection, from the hydrographic Office, G-2, and Army Map Service. The map, which was to be especially made for Military Government, was to be produced by CASA officers, making base maps and overlays, and OSS/Washington was to care for drafting and reproduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist153&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 2, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Civil Affairs Staging Area (CASA) Army &amp; Navy Officers at an Assembly.PNG|thumb|300px |left| Assembled CASA Army / Navy officers, in front of a stage with a large map of Asia, listen to a civilian speaker.]]

===== Assignment of officers =====

For research and writing of the textual part of the manuals, CASA assigned an average of 75 Army and Navy officers, who worked about six months on the project. OSS provided classified documentary material and aided the CASA library in the procurement of non classified material. OSS also established the research techniques and methods, evaluated materials, and worked directly with the officers in the collection of data and writing of text.

===== Production volume =====

The production volume was large: The Provost Marshal General's Office arranged for the printing of 75,000 volumes of manuals, the number of copies for each prefecture varying with the importance of the prefecture involved. Each manual averaged 175 pages. About 1,000,000 maps were required for map packets.

[[File:Brig. General Percy L. Sadler &amp; Colonel Hardy Cross Dillard.PNG|thumb|200px |right|CASA Commanding Officer Brig. General Percy L. Sadler and former CASA Commander Colonel Hardy Cross Dillard, acting CASA Executive Officer, at the Presidio of Monterey in July 1945.]]

===== Expediting of process =====

As the pace of operations in the Pacific Theater increased, it became apparent that the program, as originally timed, would not be completed quickly enough. CASA and OSS therefore greatly expedited the production of a few copies each of manuals on thirteen leading prefectures. OSS/San Francisco cooperated to accomplish reproduction, and the first copies, together with map packets, were sent to the Theater in time to arrive there by the time American occupation began. The regular edition, was produced later over a number of weeks.

===== Reception of manuals =====

OSS/Washington made a major contribution to the Prefectural project by making available its research resources, its facilities, and its personnel in an advisory capacity. OSS/San Francisco also stood by at all times with assistance and took over entirely the reproduction of the provisional edition of manuals on thirteen prefectures. The manuals were received with commendation and appreciation by all those, interested in intelligence materials pertaining to the Far East, who had an opportunity to examine them.

==== Consultation on planning ====

The planning activities of the Outpost were consultative in nature. A few outstanding contributions by the OSS Outpost include:

=====Chart creation=====
Creation of two detailed charts. These charts were jointly produced by OSS and S-5 Division, CASA and were reproduced in quantity by OSS/San Francisco. Since the charts were incorporated in various economic directives, effects of this research and analysis are far-reaching. The two charts were:
*''The Role of the Munitions Ministry in the Control of Japanese Wartime Industries''  
*''The Dual Administration of War Production in Japan''

=====Proclamations &amp; ordinances=====
Final review and approval by OSS consultants of all proclamations and ordinances prepared at CASA for use by Military Government in occupying Japan. This was done under short deadlines and was accomplished by the Outpost furnishing two experts on Japanese law and Japanese language.  One of the experts was formally commended by the CASA command for his participation in this project.

=====Review of bibliographies=====
Review of proposed bibliographies to be taken to the Theater by various planning groups. In this task, the accumulated knowledge of 0SS staff members was of great help to the CASA planning sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist155&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 3, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Miscellaneous functions ====

This category of functions contains some of the most outstanding services performed by the Outpost. These services were rendered to various divisions and in some instances were of incalculable benefit to CASA and the Military Government program for the Far East. Among the most noteworthy of these services, are the following:

===== Map intelligence =====

From its inception, the Outpost included in its staff a map intelligence analyst. The analyst selected and recommended all the maps for map packets in the prefectural project, procured and maintained on a catalogue basis all important maps covering the Far East and provided maps for cartographers making maps for the prefectural project. The collection was estimated at approximately 30,000 sheets and this represented virtually the heart of all map activity at CASA. Not only did the analyst provide maps, but he also prepared written articles, met with discussion groups and served as an expert consultant to CASA groups on all map matters. For example, in arriving at a decision as to what maps were to be included in kits for Military Government officers, the primary selection was made by the map intelligence analyst. The CASA map instruction program was revised with his assistance. Requests made upon the Outpost for service averaged upward of 300 each month and there was at all times a large number of maps in circulation. Requests originated largely from the Training Division (S-3) and the Planning and Research Division (S-5), but OSS also provided, maps required for a variety of purposes, from supplying maps for the map-room operated by S-2 to meeting occasional requests from Fort Ord. Maps provided, covered a wide range in scales topics subject and purpose. Although OSS came as a consultant and therefore could not attempt to supply maps in quantity, help was given CASA in obtaining maps through the Army Map Service, and the development of a map function by the CASA library was accomplished with the help of OSS.

===== Advice on Orientalia and information materials =====

Although the Outpost maintained a large collection of classified documents covering the Far East, there was careful avoidance of assuming a library function. The Outpost did, however, maintain close liaison with the CASA library and endeavored to be helpful in obtaining various materials needed for planning and training.  The OSS experts were familiar with all types of source material, both domestic and foreign, and provided much information on what was needed and where it was obtainable.

===== Maintenance of research files =====

In a very few weeks the Outpost built up an impressive collection of the best available documentary intelligence on the Far East. This collection was constantly increased through the close cooperation of OSS/Washington, various OSS offices in continental United States, and offices and Outposts throughout the world. Some of the documents maintained by the OSS Outpost included.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist157&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 3, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

*Various joint Army -Navy Intelligence Studies covering the Far East. 
*Prisoner of War Reports
*OSS/R&amp;A Reports
*Joint Target Group Folders
*Foreign Economic Administration reports
*Strategic Engineering Studies (US Engineers)
*Civil Affairs Guides
*MIS Bulletin

=====Maintenance of biographical records=====

This file consisted of approximately 15,000 items covering key Japanese personalities. Not only was the file of great value to the prefectural project, but also to training groups and to various planning sections.

=====Translation=====

Although the Outpost had clearly specified to CASA that OSS could not provide translation, the dire need at CASA led the agency on several occasions to provide translations by its Outpost staff, by its Washington staff or from other OSS sources. In addition, the Outpost endeavored to help CASA obtain an adequate number of translators so that CASA could more effectively do its job.

=====Creation of special intelligence reports=====

For about three months after its inception the Outpost published a weekly bulletin entitled, ''Far East Intelligence Notes'' This weekly contained various analytical articles prepared by Outpost personnel and was based upon information from classified sources and of interest to Military Government officers. The Notes frequently included maps. The pressure of work led to the suspension of the weekly and the Outpost began irregular publication of ''Special Intelligence Reports'' Each report covered one topic, was concerned with Military Government problems in the Far East and was issued at intervals of ten days to two weeks. As in the case of the ''Far East Intelligence Notes,'' information was drawn from classified sources. The circulation list of the Notes was small but impressive. Copies were sent to all Civil Affairs Training Schools, to the School of Military Government, Charlottesville, Virginia, to the OSS Washington, to the Civil Affairs Division, Washington, to the Provost Marshal General's Office, Washington to CinCPAC (Commander in Chief Pacific), CinCPOA (Commander in Chief Pacific Ocean Areas) and to various OSS outposts. The Reports were distributed only at CASA.&lt;ref name=&quot;usarmyhist162&quot;&gt;Army Hist. Vol. 3, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, aviation firmly established itself as a critical component of modern warfare, from the [[Battle of Britain]] in the early stages to the great [[aircraft carrier]] battles between American and Japanese Pacific fleets and the final delivery of nuclear weapons. The major combatants&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] on the one side and [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[United States]] and the [[USSR]] on the other&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; manufactured huge air forces which engaged in pitched battles both with each other and with the opposing ground forces. Bombing established itself as a major strategic force, and this was also the first war in which the [[aircraft carrier]] played a significant role.

As with [[Aviation in World War I]], military investment during [[World War II]] drove aviation forward in leaps and bounds. The [[wikt:streamlined|streamlined]] cantilever monoplane quickly proved its worth in almost every role, although a few older [[biplane]]s remained in niche roles for much of the war. Engine power and aircraft performance increased steadily, with [[jet engine|jet]] and [[rocket]] engines beginning to make their appearance by the end of the war. Avionics systems increased in sophistication and became more widespread, including power-assisted flight controls, blind flying instrumentation, radio communications and radar tracking.

The development of civil aviation stagnated until peace could be restored, and in the combatant countries many existing civilian aircraft were pressed into military service. However military technologies developed during the war would revolutionise postwar aviation. In particular, the widespread construction of aerodromes with serviceable runways would provide the basis for a postwar move of long-range passenger flights from [[flying boat]]s to landplanes.

==Aircraft==

===Airframes===
The [[wikt:streamlined|streamlined]] cantilever monoplane quickly proved its worth in almost every role, although a few older [[biplane]]s and other obsolescent types remained in niche roles for much of the war. Key design features during this period included:
*Stressed-skin semi-monocoque construction, typically of aluminium light alloy but sometimes of wooden or mixed construction.
*A clean, unbraced cantilever monoplane wing.
*Conventional tail or [[empennage]], with bombers often adopting twin tail fins, believed to improve stability during the bombing run.
*retracting [[landing gear]] of [[conventional landing gear|conventional configuration]] with a tailwheel or tailskid.
*Landing flaps.
*[[Variable-pitch propeller]]s in tractor configuration.
*Fully enclosed [[cockpit]].

The retracting undercarriage gave landplanes a significant performance advantage over the equivalent [[seaplane]], whose floats caused additional drag. In other respects, the evolution of seaplane design paralleled landplane developments. Seaplanes, typically [[flying boat]]s, remained in use for long-range maritime operations. Smaller craft, typically [[floatplane]]s, remained in other niche areas such as mountain lakes where a runway was not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, K.; &quot;Flying boats and seaplanes,&quot; Blandford (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments on other configurations continued throughout the war, especially in Germany.

A small number of [[Twin-boom aircraft|twin tailboom]] types entered production, and some slower types designed for roles such as Army observation retained the older fixed undercarriage.

Towards the end of the war the first jet aircraft entered service; the [[Arado Ar 234]] reconnaissance bomber, [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] ''Schwalbe'' (Swallow) fighter and [[Gloster Meteor]] fighter. The [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] ''Komet'' (Comet) interceptor was both [[rocket]] powered and of [[tailless aircraft|tailless]] configuration. Both of the Messerschmitt types had [[swept wing]]s to delay the onset of small shock waves and the accompanying drag at transonic speeds. Other German types delivered to front-line units in the last days of the war included the rocket-powered vertical-takeoff [[Bachem Ba 349]] ''Natter'' (Adder) interceptor — the very first manned, rocket-powered aircraft to launch vertically as designed — and the jet-powered [[Heinkel He 162]] ''Spatz'' (sparrow) light fighter.&lt;ref name=green&gt;Green (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other variations were flown but never entered production, sometimes independently by different countries. These included the [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] or tail-first configuration in combination with a pusher propeller, the [[flying wing]], the [[Hillson Bi-mono|slip-wing]] which took off as a biplane and then discarded the upper wing, and twin centrally-mounted engines in push-pull configuration with a tractor installation at the front and a pusher installation in the rear.&lt;ref name=green&gt;Green (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rotorcraft====
[[Rotorcraft]] had been produced before the war in the form of the [[autogyro]] and many, such as the [[Avro Rota]], a license-built [[Juan de la Cierva|Cierva]] design, continued in use throughout the war.

The [[Focke-Achgelis Fa 330]] ''Bachstelze'' (Wagtail) unpowered rotor kite was towed behind submarines for use as an observation platform.

In 1942 the [[Flettner Fl 282]] ''Kolibri'' (Hummingbird) observation platform became the first true helicopter with a power-driven rotor to enter production. Two years later it was followed in Germany by the twin-rotor [[Focke Achgelis Fa 223]] ''Drache'' (Kite) transport helicopter and in America by the [[Sikorsky R-4]].&lt;ref name=wg&gt;Wood and Gunston (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The R-4 was far the most-produced type and was introduced into RAF service as the Hoverfly I, where it was progressively replacing the Avro Rota autogyro by the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, K.; &quot;Helicopters and other rotorcraft since 1907,&quot; Blandford, Revised Edition, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engines===
Engine power and aircraft performance increased steadily throughout the war, with liquid-cooled inline and vee engines competing with air-cooled radials much as they had competed with air-cooled rotary types in the First War. As an example, at the start of the war the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] III liquid-cooled V-12 engine developed just 1,000&amp;nbsp;hp while at the end its derivative the [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]] 61 offered 2,035&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;Gingell (1976), Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=Griffon 61 power quoted in linked article but source not stated}}

In the early stages of the war German fighters, especially the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], were very fast and maneuverable and had the advantage over the British types of a fuel-injected engine. This allowed them to fly upside-down or to perform other negative-G manoeuvres without fear of the engine cutting out, as happened to the British types fitted with carburettors. On the other hand, the carburettor combined with a turbocharger gave better performance at altitude.&lt;ref name=gingell&gt;Gingell (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the war wore on, Germany's critical [[Luftwaffe#Critical engine development problems|inability to produce piston aviation engines of at least 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) maximum power and above]] that possessed proven front-line reliability, prevented them from fully developing more advanced strategic and tactical combat aircraft designs that would require such powerplants.

Meanwhile, [[jet engine|jet]] and [[rocket]] engines had been under steady development, the rocket especially in Germany and the jet both there and in Britain. By the end of the war they were beginning to make their appearance in operational types. The German and British jet technologies differed significantly. The axial-flow jet, in which air passes continuously backwards through the engine, was recognized as the most efficient design but required highly advanced new technologies in both materials and precision manufacture. While the Germans opted for this approach, the British chose the simpler and more robust [[centrifugal compressor]] in which the air is first flung outwards, using centrifugal force to help compress it, before being burned and returned to the axial-flow turbine stage. This resulted in a shorter but wider engine for the same airflow and output power. The Hungarian [[Jendrassik Cs-1]], in 1940 the world's first [[turboprop]], was of axial-flow design with similarly revered-flow combustion but was cancelled due to other priorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;airent1&quot;&gt;Green, W. and Swanborough, G.; &quot;Plane Facts&quot;, ''Air Enthusiast'' '''Vol. 1''' No. 1 (1971), Page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pulse jet]] was a crude jet engine which produced too much vibration to be usable for manned aircraft but found a niche in the [[V-1 flying bomb]].

===Armament===
At the start of the war, the British [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters had eight machine guns against typically four on the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], giving them far greater firepower. The early marks of Spitfire and Hurricane had machine guns that were, however, of the .30 calibre (7.62mm) class, with less hitting power than heavier calibre weapons firing non-explosive bullets - the Germans' [[MG 131 machine gun]], the Japanese [[Ho-103 machine gun]], the Soviets' [[Berezin UB]] and particularly [[M2 Browning#Aircraft guns|the &quot;light-barrel&quot; AN/M2 version]] of the American Browning M2 machine gun, all of the .50 calibre (12.7mm) size, became very widely used as primary offensive and defensive aircraft armament by the end of World War II.

The Bf 109 could also be fitted with a cannon, and later variants with up to three. These guns have exploding shells instead of solid bullets but are larger and heavier than ordinary machine guns and opinions differed on both sides as to which type was better. Some aircraft were made in both variants, while others could be modified in the field to fit either or both types. As the war progressed, higher aircraft speeds, cockpit armour and stronger airframes led to a steadily increasing preference for cannon.&lt;ref name=galland&gt;Galland (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bader&gt;Bader (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the war the British and American forces made extensive use of unguided rockets for ground attack, while the German [[Bachem Natter]] point-defence interceptor had a battery of rockets in the nose intended to be fired into an oncoming bomber formation.&lt;ref name=green /&gt;

===Avionics===
Avionics systems increased in sophistication and became more widespread, including power-assisted flight controls, blind flying instrumentation, radio communications and radar tracking.

==Ground activities==

===Manufacturing===
Aircraft manufacturing remained a high priority throughout the war for all the key combatants and was a major part of their economic output. Women, and in Germany slave labour, were extensively employed due to the military call-up of able-bodied men.

Due to the threat of bombing, especially in Europe, manufacturing became progressively more dispersed. When British and American bombing raids started in earnest, Germany moved much of its production into underground factories.

Strategic materials such as aluminium for airframes and petroleum oil for fuel were in limited supply and soon became scarce. Many manufacturers, especially in the Soviet Union and, later on, in Germany turned to more readily-available raw materials such as timber and coal. The [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fighter-bomber was a rare British example of a wooden aeroplane.

===Airfields===
At the outbreak of war there were relatively few [[aerodrome]]s capable of supporting military aircraft operations. Land-based aircraft with  retracting undercarriage had superior performance to the equivalent [[seaplane]]s, leading to the widespread construction of aerodromes throughout all theatres of campaign. After the war many of these would become civil [[airport]]s, providing the basis for a move of long-range passenger flights from [[flying boat]]s to landplanes.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, K.; &quot;Flying boats and seaplanes,&quot; Blandford (1971), Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing sophistication of warplanes meant that ground facilities also became more sophisticated. The high-powered engines in use could no longer be started by hand-swinging the propeller, but powered starting systems had to be provided, whether mechanical as with the [[Hucks starter]] or electrical as with the wheeled battery pack or trolley accumulator used for aircraft such as the Spitfire, which had an inbuilt electric starter motor.&lt;ref name=gingell /&gt;

==Military aviation==
{{Main|Air warfare of World War II}}

Aviation during this period was dominated by the conduct of the war, and the war in turn by air power. Aviation was heavily involved in the development of military technologies, strategies, tactics and events throughout the war.

At the outbreak of the war in Europe in 1939, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' had amassed an attack force of modern all-metal cantilever monoplanes designed to support the ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' style of warfare at relatively short range and manufactured by a large and organised industry. Pilots had been well-trained, both in flying clubs and in some cases the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Other European air forces, especially the British [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] were struggling to re-equip with similarly modern types and to train up aircrew. Early German successes, with the notable assistance of the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bomber, overran Europe and left Britain open to attack.

During the ensuing [[Battle of Britain]], the British fighter squadrons had to quickly relearn the old tactical lessons from the first war. Initially the RAF fighters flew in a tight three-fighter arrowhead formation, soon changing to the looser four-aircraft arrangement which the Germans called the &quot;finger-four.&quot; They soon also relearned the value of climbing above your opponent before attacking. At the same time, the development of an early [[radar]] warning system by the British provided a new way to track German attack formations as they gathered over the European coast and flew across the [[English Channel]]. The radio communications, provided to every pilot, also required new protocols such as radio silence before engaging the enemy.&lt;ref name=galland /&gt;&lt;ref name=bader /&gt;

Later on, the British and Americans developed large long-range heavy bombers, causing great damage to the German war effort and substantial casualties. While the British favoured unescorted night bombing, the Americans preferred to mount daytime raids, escorted by long-range fighters.

In the Pacific war, both sides made extensive use of [[aircraft carrier]]s and carrier-to-carrier engagements became pivotal turning points in several campaigns.

==Civil aviation==
Civil aviation continued in non-combatant countries.

In countries engaged in warfare, many civilian aircraft were pressed into military service. Some civilian operations were maintained, for example [[BOAC]] continued making overseas passenger flights, often camouflaging its aircraft.

They deployed the 800mm rail gun [[Dora (artillery)|Dora]] to destroy it. On June 6, 1942, heavy guns and mortars managed to make direct hits on the battery which destroyed one of the gun turrets and damaged the other.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;After the Germans overran the Perekop Line...the Germans deployed their super heavy artilley, including the 800mm rail gun Dora to destroy key points like Maxim Gorky I.

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''How Hitler Lost the War'' was mostly positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stark|first=John|title=Picks and Pans Review: Power Failures|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20119741,00.html|publisher=People|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the movie a B- but commented that the film's thesis was &quot;dubious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Hitler Lost the War (review)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306902,00.html|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' praised the documentary and called it &quot;a fascinating re-examination of the misdirection of one of the greatest war machines the world has ever known&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruth|first=Daniel|title=How Hitler Lost the War|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3933637.html|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times (subscription required)|date=March 16, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the film was &quot;sporadically interesting but far from persuasive&quot; and noted that it lacked a contrary analysis of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Walter|title=Review/Television; Could Hitler Have Won?

The '''Compiègne Wagon''' was the historical wagon in which the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|First]] and [[Second Armistice at Compiegne|Second Armistice at Compiègne]] were signed.

After the first armistice was signed in the [[forest of Compiègne]], the wagon was eventually moved to a protective place in a French museum. After the second armistice at Compiègne, the wagon was moved to Berlin to symbolize Germany's superiority over France.

In the last days of [[World War II]], the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] blew up the wagon with dynamite.

== History ==

The wagon was built in 1914 in Saint-Denis as a dining car and was used as such until August 1918. Then the passenger car was converted into an office for Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], who used it from the end of October 1918 to September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://stevenlehrer.com/compiegne.htm |title=Compiègne |last=Lehrer |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Lehrer |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 1918, Foch, as Supreme Commander of the Western Front, signed the armistice with Germany in the then-called &quot;Wagon of Compiègne&quot;. This agreement was the final &quot;cease-fire&quot; which ended fighting in the First World War; the other [[Central Powers]] having already reached agreements with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] to end hostilities.

Sometime after this the car was returned to the [[Compagnie des Wagons-Lits]] and briefly resumed service as a dining car.  In September 1919, it was donated to the [[Musée de l'Armée]], in Paris. The wagon on display in the Cour des Invalides from 1921 to 1927.

At the request of the Mayor of Compiègne, and with the support of the American [[Arthur Henry Fleming]] the car was restored and returned to Compiègne.  There it was housed in a specially created museum building as part of the &quot;[[Glade of the Armistice]]&quot; historic monument, built at the site of the signing ceremony.

During the Second World War, Hitler ordered that the wagon be returned to exactly the same location for the signing of the second &quot;armistice at Compiègne&quot;, on 22 June 1940; this time with Germany victorious.  The carriage was moved out of its protective building and returned to the signing-place, which was several metres away and had been marked out as part of the monument.  Subsequently, the wagon was taken to Berlin and displayed a week later at the Berlin Cathedral. In 1944 the wagon was sent to Thuringia, in central Germany. Then it came to Ruhla and later Gotha [[Crawinkel]], near a huge tunnel system.  There it was destroyed in March 1945 by the SS with fire and/or dynamite, in the face of the advancing U.S. Army. However, some SS veterans claim that the wagon had been destroyed by air attack near [[Ohrdruf]] while still in Thuringia in 1944. Even so, it's generally believed the wagon was destroyed in 1945 by the SS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eberhardt-pfeiffer.de/Salonwagen.html &quot;Compiegne&quot;]. ''Eberhardt''.

In [[William Shirer]]'s ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', Halder's diary is cited hundreds of times.

The diaries were published as ''The Halder diaries: The Private War Journals of Colonel General Franz Halder'' in 2 volumes in 1976 by [[Westview Press]] of [[Boulder, Colorado]], with an introduction by [[Trevor N. Dupuy]] (ISBN 9780891581062). The original German version had the title ''Kriegstagebuch'' (&quot;War Diaries&quot;) and the translation had been published in 8 volumes in 1948 by the Office of Chief Counsel for War Crimes, Office of Military Government for Germany (U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/halder-diaries-the-private-war-journals-of-colonel-general-franz-halder/oclc/2189197|title=Worldcat catalogue record for ''The Halder diaries''|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1940 Field Marshal Ceremony.gif|right|thumb|300px|Hitler posing with his field marshals at the ceremony]]

The '''1940 Field Marshal Ceremony''' refers to a promotion ceremony held at the [[Kroll Opera House]] in [[Berlin]] in which [[Adolf Hitler]] promoted twelve [[general]]s to the rank of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' (&quot;[[field marshal]]&quot;) on 19 July 1940. It was the first occasion in [[World War II]] that Hitler appointed field marshals due to military achievements.

The prestigious rank of field marshal had been banned after the [[First World War]]. As part of the [[German re-armament|Nazi expansion of the military]], the rank was revived. Hitler promoted twelve selected generals to field marshal during the ceremony in Berlin for their role in the swift victory over [[France]] and the [[Low Countries]] and to raise morale. The ceremony highlighted the power and prestige of the [[Wehrmacht]]; France was considered to have had [[Military history of France during World War II|the strongest army in Europe]], yet had been humiliatingly defeated in just six weeks.

The ceremony was the first time Hitler appointed field marshals due to military achievements and was celebrated like no other promotion ceremony of the war.

==Field marshal==
{{main|Generalfeldmarschall}}
After World War I, the prestigious and respected rank of field marshal was banned, alongside other [[Treaty of Versailles|military restrictions]] imposed on the newly formed [[Weimar Republic]]. After Hitler and Nazis came to national power in January 1933, they began an enormous expansion of the military; it was part of Hitler's desire to restore the army's power and prestige.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|pp=26–27}} In 1936, he revived the rank of field marshal. It was the highest and most prestigious military rank in Germany, originally only for the use of the [[Minister of War]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Army.{{sfn|Hakim|1995|pp=100–104}} The traditional attribute distinguishing a German field marshal was an ornately decorated baton.{{sfn|Alford|2003|pp=66–67}} More tangible benefits included a yearly salary of 36,000 ''[[Reichsmarks]]'' and all earnings being exempt from income tax.{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=111}}

Flushed with enthusiasm by the swift defeat of the French army, considered to have been the strongest in Europe,{{sfn|Rees|2012}} and the Low Countries in June 1940, Hitler wanted to mark the occasion with a grand promotion ceremony.{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=24}} He also hoped the promotions would strengthen his influence over the traditional [[German General Staff]].{{sfn|Snyder|1994|pp=111–112}} The twelve generals chosen for promotion, who all had played an important role in the victory, were:

* Colonel General [[Walther von Brauchitsch]]{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=112}}
* Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]]{{sfn|Turney|1971|p=6}}
* General [[Albert Kesselring]]{{sfn|Kesselring|1970|p=55}}
* Colonel General [[Wilhelm Keitel]]{{sfn|Sandler|2002|p=455}}
* Colonel General [[Günther von Kluge]]{{sfn|Moczarski|1981|pp=226–234}}
* Colonel General [[Wilhelm von Leeb]]{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=647}}
* Colonel General [[Wilhelm List]]{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=28}}
* Colonel General [[Erhard Milch]]{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=229}}
* Colonel General [[Walther von Reichenau]]{{sfn|Biesinger|2006|p=619}}
* Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]{{sfn|Mackenzie|2014|p=17}}
* General [[Hugo Sperrle]]{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=46}}
* Colonel General [[Erwin von Witzleben]]{{sfn|Mitcham|2009a|pp=1–2}}

Additionally, Field Marshal [[Hermann Göring]], head of the Luftwaffe, was promoted to the specially-created rank of Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich, a newly created rank that not only made Göring the senior officer of the military, but also confirmed an earlier Hitler decree naming Göring his successor. This was the only award of this rank during the Nazi era, and it was abolished after the fall of the Nazi regime. &lt;ref&gt;''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', by William L. Shirer.

On 19 July 1940, Hitler summoned the generals to a ceremony in Berlin's [[Kroll Opera House]] (which housed the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] after the [[Reichstag fire]]).{{sfn|Deighton|2008|pp=7–9}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=122–123}}{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=24}} After a speech regarding a peace proposal directed at Britain, Hitler personally rewarded his generals with their expensively decorated batons,{{sfn|Deighton|2008|pp=7–9}}{{sfn|Alford|2003|pp=66–67}} and thanked them for their contributions to the victory.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=322}}{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=94}}{{efn|name=Göring rank}}

The 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony was the first occasion Hitler appointed field marshals due to military achievements and was celebrated like no other promotion ceremony in Germany.{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=24}}{{sfn|Tague|2011|p=150}} The remaining five years of the war saw an additional [[List of German field marshals#Nazi Germany|twelve promotions]], most of which were without ceremony, such as [[Friedrich Paulus]]'s promotion, which was conferred over the radio by Hitler.{{sfn|Beevor|1998|p=381}}{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=112}}{{efn
| name = Paulus incident
| 1=In deciding to promote Paulus during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Hitler noted that there was no known record of a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] or German field marshal ever having surrendered. The implication was clear: Paulus was to commit suicide. If Paulus surrendered, Hitler implied he would shame Germany's military history. Paulus, nevertheless, surrendered to Soviet forces on 31 January 1943, the day after he was promoted.{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=112}}

==Aftermath==
{{also|20 July plot}}
All of the generals promoted would go on to achieve further success in their careers during the early years of victory which the German military obtained in the Second World War. Brauchitsch, Bock, Kesselring, Keitel, Leeb, List, Reichenau, Rundstedt, and Göring would all play decisive and important roles in the German-led [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941.{{sfn|Grazhdan|2011}} Sperrle spent the rest of the war in semi-retirement, based with his unit in France.{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=46}} Milch was transferred to the production department and was responsible for aircraft production until the end of the war. In 1943, after a series of German defeats on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and the Allied invasion of [[Italy]], the German military lost all initiative.{{sfn|Rees|2012}} Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions.{{sfn|Rees|2012}} His response to the worsening war situation was to unceremoniously sack general after general, a routine which ultimately affected the field marshals promoted at the ceremony.{{sfn|Rees|2012}} [[Erwin von Witzleben]] and [[Günther von Kluge]] were both involved in the [[20 July Plot]] to assassinate Hitler. After it became clear that the assassination attempt had failed, Kluge committed suicide by taking [[cyanide|cyanide poison]] on 17 August 1944.{{sfn|Moczarski|1981|pp=226–234}} Witzleben, who was to become Commander-in-Chief of the [[Wehrmacht]] if the attempt had succeeded, was arrested and sentenced to death; the execution was carried out on 8 August 1944.{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=382}}

'''''Killing Patton: The Strange Death of World War II's Most Audacious General''''' is a  book written by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Martin Dugard (author)|Martin Dugard]] about the final year of [[World War II]] and the death of General [[George Patton]], specifically about whether or not it was an accident or an assassination. The book is the followup to ''[[Killing Kennedy]]'', ''[[Killing Lincoln]]'', and ''[[Killing Jesus]]'' and was published in September 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/killing-patton-bill-oreilly/1119628112?ean=9780805096682|title=Killing Patton: The Strange Death of World War II's Most Audacious General|author=Currdog|date=28 September 2014|work=Barnes &amp; Noble|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Erik|last1=Wemple|title=Next from Fox News host Bill O’Reilly: ‘Killing Patton’|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/05/29/next-from-fox-news-host-bill-oreilly-killing-patton/|work=The Washington Post|date=May 29, 2014|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Henry Holt and Company]].

==Reception==

Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Richard Cohen (columnist)|Richard Cohen]] criticized the book's &quot;chaotic structure&quot; and &quot;considerable padding,&quot; calling the work a &quot;clunky hagiography.&quot; Cohen was especially critical of O'Reilly's &quot;repellent admiration&quot; for Patton in light of his demonstrable anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Richard|last1=Cohen|date=September 29, 2014|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cohen-bill-oreilly-ignored-george-pattons-anti-semitism/2014/09/29/afe3e3ea-4806-11e4-b72e-d60a9229cc10_story.html|title=What Bill O’Reilly ignored about George Patton|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Gad|last1=Nahshon|url=http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/the-power-of-prejudice.html|title=The Power of Prejudice|work=[[Jewish Post of New York]]|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[James Wolcott]] dismissed the book as O'Reilly's &quot;latest papier-mâché exercise in necrobiography.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120027/not-kind-girl-review-lena-dunhams-callow-grating-memoir|title='Not That Kind of Girl' Review: Lena Dunham's Callow, Grating Memoir|first1=James|last1=Wolcott|date=November 6, 2014|work=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patton biographer and documentary filmmaker Robert Orlando described ''Killing Patton'' and O'Reilly's &quot;Killing&quot; series as &quot;not about new or penetrating discovery, but the same ol' same ol' only through this greatly successful marketer and his hired writer—a scheduled feeding for an audience already 'on the farm.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Robert|last1=Orlando|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-orlando/the-killing-factor-when-c_b_5826362.html|title=The Killing Factor: When Conspiracy Becomes the Mainstream|work=The Huffington Post|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wes Vernon of ''[[The Washington Times]]'' remarked that “''Killing Patton'' is rich in blow-by-blow accounts of some of the most significant battles of World War II, as well as of many off-battlefield lives of its primary movers whose personalities virtually come to life in this well-crafted narrative.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Wes|last1=Vernon|date=October 6, 2014|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/6/book-review-how-did-patton-die/?page=all|title=BOOK REVIEW: 'Killing Patton'|work=The Washington Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the Amazon Book Review, Senator [[John McCain]] opined that the book was &quot;[...] rich in fascinating details, and riveting battle scenes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foro|first1=Jon|title=Exclusive: Senator John McCain Reviews Bill O'Reilly's &quot;Killing Patton&quot;|url=http://www.omnivoracious.com/2014/09/senator-john-mccain-reviews-bill-oreillys-killing-patton.html|website=Omnivoracious - The Amazon Book Review|date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians have criticized O'Reilly's claim that Patton was assassinated and pointed out that he presented no hard evidence that foul play was involved in Patton's death. Some have speculated that O'Reilly and Dugard got the idea for this hypothesis from the 1978 movie ''[[Brass Target]]'' that portrayed the General's death as an assassination; however, the movie was only fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20141001_000000_The_OReilly_Factor#start/3420/end/3480|title=The O'Reilly Factor : FOXNEWSW : September 30, 2014 5:00pm-6:01pm PDT : Free Streaming : Internet Archive|work=Internet Archive|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20141001_000000_The_OReilly_Factor#start/3480/end/3540|title=The O'Reilly Factor : FOXNEWSW : September 30, 2014 5:00pm-6:01pm PDT : Free Streaming : Internet Archive|work=Internet Archive|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
On November 24, 2015, [[National Geographic Channel]] and [[Scott Free Productions]] jointly announced the television adaptation of ''Killing Patton''. [[Anthony Peckham]] is attached to write the four-hour teleplay, with plans to air the film in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Littleton|first=Cythnia|title=Bill O’Reilly’s ‘Killing Patton’ Next Up For Nat Geo Channel, Scott Free Movie Franchise|url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/bill-oreilly-killing-patton-movie-national-geographic-1201647734/|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=November 24, 2015|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''Seilbombe''''' ({{IPA-de|saɪlbɔmbə}}, plural '''''Seilbomben''''', {{IPA-de|saɪlbɔmbən|}}), literally &quot;rope bomb&quot;, was a secret German weapon developed during the Second World War designed to disable the electrical power grid of an invaded territory. Equipped with it, a German [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] fighter plane or an [[Arado 196]] float  plane would fly low at night over areas near enemy power plants or urban centers where power lines were located and would use it to cause local blackouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lepage2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean-Denis G.G. Lepage|title=Aircraft of the Luftwaffe, 1935-1945: An Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdQBTcscxyQC&amp;pg=PA319|date=5 February 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5280-4|pages=319–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would, it was hoped, lead to civilian panic and the inability of local opposing forces to coordinate a defense. The piloting of planes so equipped was extremely dangerous, as it required the pilot to fly his plane almost directly at enemy power lines in the dark when visibility was already severely limited and within easy range of anti-aircraft fire.

==Operation==
The ''Seilbombe'' device was a box-like frame attached to the belly of plane with a roll of strong, detachable 70- to 80-foot long cables connected in series and attached to a set of pulleys, each cable having a small weight attached to one end. The fighter pilot would fly his craft low over sections of the electrical grid while trailing the cable beneath and behind it. When one cable wrapped around an electricity cable, it broke off, short-circuiting that cable. The ''Bordfunker'' (&quot;radio operator&quot;) of the plane would then use a control box to reel out the next length of cable, and the Bf 110 would continue to the next section of the grid.

==Implementation==
''Seilbomben'' saw little actual use by German forces. They were considered for the attack on Moscow, [[Operation Barbarossa]], where assaulting the city's power plants appeared to some German commanders to be a more useful tool for subjugating the city than outright terror (the Russian populace was considered too obstinate for the latter to be effective).&lt;ref name=&quot;BoogKrebs2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Horst Boog|author2=Gerhard Krebs|author3=Detlef Vogel|title=Germany and the Second World War: Volume VII: The Strategic Air War in Europe and the War in the West and East Asia, 1943-1944/5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmgTAQAAMAAJ|date=29 June 2006|publisher=Clarendon|isbn=978-0-19-822889-9|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were also considered but never implemented for the planned invasion of England, [[Operation Sea Lion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macksey1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Macksey|title=Invasion: The Alternate History of the German Invasion of England, July 1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Yt3ngEACAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Greenhill|isbn=978-1-85367-361-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hitler Stalingrad Speech''' was an address made by [[Adolf Hitler]] to senior members of the [[Nazi Party]] on November 8, 1942.  The speech took place at the Löwenbräukeller in [[Stiglmaierplatz]] in [[Munich]] during the height of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. For three-quarters of his oratory, Hitler speaks in a normal tone of voice, at one point making a joke, and only raising his voice at the end of his narrative. The speech is, next to the [[Hitler and Mannerheim recording|Mannerheim recording]] and a short comment,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitler Normal Voice&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X224evP3Su4''Hitler speaks with normal voice''&lt;/ref&gt; the only recording in which Hitler is heard speaking completely normally.

==Text of speech==

The first segment of Hitler's speech berates Soviet military ability, and Hitler cites several examples of Soviet military leaders exaggerating casualty figures.

:''If we follow our enemies' propaganda, then I must say that is to be compared
:''with &quot;Rejoicing towards Heaven, depressed until Death&quot;'''
:''The slightest success anywhere, and they literally turn somersaults in joy.''
:''They have already destroyed us, and then the page turns and again they are cast down''
:''and depressed.  I did not want to attack in the center, not only because Stalin''
:''knew I would.  I provide one such example.  If you read the Russian telegrams''
:''every day since June 22nd, they say the following each day: &quot;Fighting of unimportant''
:''character&quot;.  Or maybe of important character.  &quot;We have shot down three times as many''
:''German planes.  The amount of sunken tonnage is already greater than the entire naval''
:''tonnage, of all the German tonnage from before.&quot;  They have so many of us missing that''
:''this amounts to more divisions than we can ever muster.  But, above all, they are always''
:''fighting in the same place.  &quot;Here and there&quot;, they say modestly, &quot;after fourteen days we have''
:''evacuated the city.&quot;  But, in general, since June 22nd they have been fighting in the same''
:''place.  Always successful, we are constantly being beaten back.  And in this continued retreat''
:''we have slowly come to the [[Caucasus]].''

After a brief applause, Hitler resumes his speech and explains his reasoning for attacking Stalingrad.  In his narrative, Hitler becomes almost comical, and suggests that the city of Stalingrad could have had another name (from Stalin) and this wasn't why he ordered his Army to attack.  The comment drew a round of laughter from the assembled audience.

:''I should say that for our enemies, and not for your soldiers, that the speed at which our soldiers''
:''have now traversed territory is gigantic.  And what has transcribed this past year is vast and''
:''historically unique.  Now, I do not always do things just as others want them done.  I consider''
:''what the other probably believe and then do the opposite on principle.  So, if I did not want to''
:''attack in the center, not only because Mr. Stalin probably believed I would, but because I didn't''
:''care about it at all.  But I wanted to come to the Volga, to a specific place and a specific city.''
:''it happened to have Stalin's name, but that's not why I went there.  It could have had another name.''

In the final segment of the speech, Hitler provides statistics for the strategic importance of Stalingrad and then proclaims that Germany now holds the city.

:''But, now this is a very important point.  Because from here comes 30 millions tons of traffic, including''
:''about nine millions tons of oil shipments.  From there the wheat pours in from these enormous territories of''
:''the [[Ukraine]] and from the [[Kuban]] region then to be transported north.  From here comes [[magnesium]] ore.''
:''A gigantic terminal is there and I wanted to take it.  But, as you know, we are modest.  That is to say that''
:''we have it now.  Only a few small pockets of resistance are left.  Some would say &quot;Why not fight onwards?&quot;  Because''
:''I don't want a second [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]!  I would rather hold this with small combat patrols!  Time''
:''does not matter, no ships are coming up the Volga!  That is the important point.''

==Media references==

The Hitler Stalingrad Speech is portrayed in the film ''[[Stalingrad (1993 film)|Stalingrad]]'' where a group of embattled [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers, entrenched from positions within the city of Stalingrad itself, listen to Hitler while they are in turn surrounded by Russian forces. This speech is also featured in an episode of the 1988 miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance,&quot; when Hitler was addressing party faithful. It occurred on the same day as the Allied invasion of North Africa.

If the retreat is a success, such an army might hold out for years&quot; ({{cite journal |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 12, 1945 |title=World Battlefronts: Battle of Germany: The Man Who Can't Surrender |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852130-4,00.html}})&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan was never fully endorsed by Hitler and no serious attempt was made to put the plan into operation.

==History==
[[File:Final Operations - 19 April-7 Mai 1945.jpg|450px|thumb|The final operations of the Western Allied armies in Germany between 19 April and 7 May 1945]]

In the six months following the [[D-Day]] landings in [[Normandy]] in June 1944, the [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] armies advanced to the [[Rhine]] and seemed poised to strike into the heart of [[Germany]], while the Soviet Army, advancing from the east through [[Poland]], reached the [[Oder]]. It seemed likely that [[Berlin]] would soon fall and Germany be divided. In these circumstances, it occurred both to some leading figures in the German regime and to the Allies that the logical thing for the Germans to do would be to move the government to the mountainous areas of southern Germany and Austria, where a relatively small number of determined troops could hold out for some time.

A number of intelligence reports to the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces ([[SHAEF]]) identified the area held stores of foodstuffs and military supplies built up over the preceding six months, and could even be harbouring armaments production facilities. Within this fortified terrain, they said, Hitler would be able to evade the Allies and cause tremendous difficulties for the occupying Allied forces throughout Germany.

The minister of propaganda, [[Joseph Goebbels]], set up a special unit to invent and spread rumours about an ''Alpenfestung''. Goebbels also sent out rumours to neutral governments, thus keeping the Redoubt myth alive and its state of readiness unclear. He enlisted the assistance of the intelligence service of the SS, the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], to produce faked blueprints and reports on construction supplies, armament production and troop transfers to the Redoubt. This utter deception of allied military intelligence is considered to be one of the greatest feats of the German ''Abwehr'' during the entire war.

Although Adolf Hitler never endorsed the plan, he issued an order on 24 April 1945 for the evacuation of remaining government personnel from Berlin to the Redoubt; he made it clear that he would not leave Berlin himself, even if it fell to the Soviets, as it did on 2 May 1945 (see [[Battle of Berlin]]).

Nevertheless, the National Redoubt had serious military and political consequences. Once the Anglo-American armies had crossed the Rhine and advanced into western Germany a decision had to be made whether to advance on a narrow front towards Berlin or in a simultaneous push by all Western armies spanning from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Alps]].  America's most aggressive commander, [[Third Army (United States)|Third Army]] head General [[George S. Patton]] in General [[Omar Bradley]]'s centrally located [[Twelfth Army Group]], had advocated a narrow front ever since D-Day, and did so again; likewise at this point British [[21st Army Group]] chief Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] in the north, each lobbying to be the decisive spearhead.  Cautious Allied commander in chief U.S. General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], however, resisted both. Ultimately, this broad front strategy left the [[Seventh Army (United States)|Seventh Army]] of General [[Jacob L. Devers]]' southern [[Sixth Army Group]] in a position at war's end to race south through Bavaria into Austria to prevent German entrenchment in any mountain redoubt and cut off alpine passes to Nazi escape.

When the American armies penetrated Bavaria and western Austria at the end of April, they met little organized resistance, and the National Redoubt was shown to have been a myth.&lt;ref name=&quot;World War II Operational Documents&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author =Headquarters, European Theater of Operations|title=World War II Operational Documents|date=15 April 1945|pages=382–383|url=http://cgsc.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p4013coll8/id/4046|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alpine Fortress was one of three reasons{{which|date=May 2015}} associated with SHAEF's movement of forces towards southern Germany rather than towards Berlin, which was planned to be in the [[Soviet Zone of Occupation]], and the [[Battle of Berlin|battle for which]] would have entailed unacceptably high Western Allied casualties.

==Evacuations to the Alpine Fortress==
*February/early March 1945, SHAEF received reports that German military, government and [[Nazi Party]] offices and their staffs were leaving Berlin for the area around [[Berchtesgaden]], the site of Hitler's retreat in the Bavarian Alps.
*In February 1945, the SS evacuated [[V-2 rocket]] scientists from the [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]] to the Alpine Fortress.
*[[SS]] Generalleutnant [[Gottlob Berger]] claimed Hitler had signed a 22 April 1945 order to evacuate 35,000 prisoners to the Alpine Fortress as hostages, but Berger did not carry out the order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141003887,00.html |title=''The Last Escape'' |author1=Nichol, John |author2=Rennell, Tony |date=2002 |publisher=Penguin UK |accessdate=November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220065054/http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141003887,00.html |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (many evacuated locations also failed to obey Hitler's order requiring [[Nero Decree|Demolitions on Reich Territory]], e.g., [[Mittelwerk]]).

==Post-war claims==
[[Post-war]] claims regarding the Alpine Fortress include:
*The Alpine Fortress &quot;grew into so exaggerated a scheme that I am astonished we could have believed it as innocently as we did.  But while it persisted, this legend of the Redoubt was too ominous a threat to be ignored.&quot;  (General [[Omar Bradley]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirer1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author =[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]]|title=[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]:&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;History&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Nazi&amp;nbsp;Germany|date=15 November 1990|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-0-671-72868-7|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sY8svb-MNUwC&amp;pg=PA1106 1106–]}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Goetheplatz''' is a [[U-Bahn]] station in [[Munich|Munich, Germany]], in operation since 19 October 1971. It is used by the U3 and U6 lines, for which it originally was the southern terminus.&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, Florian [https://www.u-bahn-muenchen.de/netz/bahnhoefe/go/ &quot;U-Bahnhof Goetheplatz (U3, U6)&quot;] ''www.u-bahn-muenchen.de'', 30 May 2013. Retrieved in January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frey|first1=Matthias|title=Munich, Germany U-Bahn|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/world/de/munich-u6.html|website=nycsubway.org|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shell of the tunnel from [[Sendlinger Tor (Munich U-Bahn)|Sendlinger Tor]] to Goetheplatz (including the station) was completed between 1938 and 1941. It was originally part of a planned North-South [[Munich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] line. However, construction was halted due to the war effort of [[World War II]] and the tunnel was used as bomb-shelter. This structural work was used later in the construction of the U-Bahn network.&lt;ref&gt;Schütz, Florian [https://www.u-bahn-muenchen.de/report/lindwurmtunnel &quot;Vorkriegstunnel Am Goetheplatz&quot;], 12 June 2007. Retrieved in January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The station has an unusual length of {{convert|135|m|ft}} and is longer than any other U-Bahn station which have a uniform length of {{convert|120|m|ft}}. It is also one of the stations on Munich's U-Bahn network where classical music is played all-day via loudspeakers.

The largest part of the station lies below Lindwurmstraße and only the northern end is beneath Goetheplatz. At both ends an intermediate floor can be reached by escalators and stairs. Goetheplatz can be reached by a variety of exits including escalators and an elevator. However, at the southern end only two relatively small staircases lead to both sides of Lindwurmstraße. On both intermediate floors, small kiosks can be found, with a bakery store on the northern side.

The interior design was planned by [[Paolo Nestler]], as had the other stations of the original U6 line. The walls behind the tracks consist of slate blue fibre cement boards through which a blue line is drawn (an indicator of the blue metro line). The columns have been covered with ceramic tiles of different shades of green. Light is provided by individual fluorescent tubes embedded in the ceiling panels, which is supposed to reflect from the stone plates inlaid with small pebbles from the [[Isar River|Isar]].

'''Agfa-Commando''' is the widely used name for the München-Giesing - Agfa Kamerawerke [[List of subcamps of Dachau|satellite camp]] of the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. By October 1944, the camp housed about five hundred women. They were used as [[Slave labor in Germany during World War II|slave laborers]] in the [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]] camera factory (part of the [[IG Farben]] group) in München-Giesing, a suburb on the S.W. side of [[Munich]] 14 miles (23&amp;nbsp;km) from the main camp of Dachau. The women assembled [[ignition timing]] devices for bombs, artillery ammunition and [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 flying bomb|V-2]] rockets; they used every opportunity to sabotage the production. In January 1945, citing the lack of food, the prisoners conducted a strike, an unheard-of action in a concentration camp.  Production ended on 23 April 1945 and the women marched toward [[Wolfratshausen]], where their commander eventually surrendered to advancing American troops.

==Creation of subcamps==
{{main article|Subcamp (SS)}}
Dachau was the first concentration camp (known as a &quot;KZ&quot;) that [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] had built. It was already in existence in 1933 and developed into a prototype for subsequent concentration camps such as [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], which appeared in 1937. The concentration camp was not geographically restricted to [[Dachau]] itself. At the onset of war, the [[SS]] increasingly employed concentration camp prisoners in [[arms industry|armaments factories]] and these specific labor commands created a network of subcamps throughout Germany.  In some cases the prisoners were accommodated in diverse, makeshift sleeping areas; in other cases the SS had them erect their own camp with watchtowers and fences. Many such subcamps, called the ''KZ-Außenlager'', were laid out in similar fashion to the concentration camps. There were also SS camp commanders (''SS-Lagerführer'') and [[prisoner functionaries]] such as the &quot;camp senior&quot; (''Lagerältester'') or &quot;block senior&quot; (''Blockältester'').&lt;ref&gt;Stanislav Zámečník: ''Das war Dachau''. Luxemburg, 2002, ISBN 2-87996-948-4. p. 150, and p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1927 and 1945, Agfa was the principal photographic equipment producer, and the largest photographic manufacturer in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Sachsse, ''AGFA'', &lt;u&gt;Encyclopedia of 19th Century Photography&lt;/u&gt;, John Hannavy (ed). Routledge, 2013, ISBN 9781135873264 p 20.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941, Agfa Camera works produced exclusively for the [[Wehrmacht]] and employed a growing number of prisoners from Dachau.&lt;ref&gt;Silke Fengler, [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45872 Agfa AG], in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, version 19.12.2011.  Accessed 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely they were returned to the main camp in the evenings during the first years, and the subcamp in München-Giesing, where the laborers&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The mean population was 500. See Pierre Moulin, '' American Samurais&amp;mdash; WWII Camps: From USA Concentration Camps to the Nazi Death Camps in Europe'', AuthorHouse, 2012, ISBN 9781477213353 p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  assembled timing devices, was not established until September 1944. The camp commander came in function on 12 September 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Munich Camera Works (Agfa) Subcamp [http://www.hdbg.de/dachau/pdfs/10/10_02/10_02_03.PDF Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoners==
About five hundred prisoners from Eastern and Southeastern Europe, mainly Poland, arrived from [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] on 13 September 1944. Little is known about the Polish women except that many of them were taken as slave labor in reprisal for the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. [[Ludwig Eiber]] mentions a forty-year old Polish women who died on 7 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Eiber, L. (1996). ''KZ-Außenlager in München''&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1944, after a Christmas party, two of these prisoners escaped, dressed as Josef and Maria in some borrowed clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Jack van Ommen, ''The Mastmaker's Daughters,'' [http://www.themastmakersdaughters.us/ ''Christmas in Dachau'']. Accessed 17 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an unconfirmed account of Leni Leuvenberg, twenty Polish women were killed during a bombing on 25 February 1945.

In October 1944, 250 Polish prisoners were sent back to Ravensbrück, in exchange for 193 Dutch women, ten women from other West European countries and fifty women from Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Among the latter were twenty-one [[Slovenia]]n political prisoners, mostly (communist) [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. The Dutch women arrived on October 15, 1944 from Ravensbrück where they had arrived in September from the Dutch [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|concentration camp Vught]]. Most had been active in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] and had formed bonds already in Vught. They were a cohesive, supportive group; they marched singing into the [[cattle cars]] in Vught and walked singing into Ravensbrück concentration camp.

Out of the 193 Dutch women, ''only'' two died just before the war's end. In comparison, a third of the Dutch women that stayed behind in Ravensbrück did not survive.

==Prison life==
Very little has been published and most facts were collected from written memoirs and oral testimony of the Dutch survivors.&lt;ref&gt;For his book ''The Mastmakers' Daughters'' Jack van Ommen relied mainly on the unpublished memoirs of Tiny (Ettina) van Delft-Boosman, Kiky Heinsius and his mother Renny van Ommen-de Vries.&lt;/ref&gt; [[:de:Ella Lingens-Reiner|Ella Lingens]] spent a few months as a prisoner-doctor in the camp dispensary, from December 1944. Her book ''Gefangene der Angst'' was published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Lingens, Ella. ''Gefangene der Angst, ein Leben im Zeichen des Widerstandes'', Deuticke Verlag, 2003, ISBN 3216307123&lt;/ref&gt; She is critical of the Dutch prisoners and calls them naive. Her views became a thorny issue with the Dutch ex-prisoners, in the long drawn-out compensation claims against [[IG Farben]]. French prisoner [[:fr:Marie Bartette|Marie Bartette]] published her memoirs in the ''Journal d’Arcachon'' in 1946-1947.&lt;ref name=Bartette&gt;Marie Bartette [http://shaa.fr/pb/?p=649 ''Les étapes d’une déportée'', Société historique et archéologique d'Arcachon et du Pays de Buch], 27 June 2014. Accessed 25 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, 2015, the stories of a number of Dutch Dachau political prisoners were published as ''Geen nummers maar namen''. The publication contains input for Renny van Ommen-de Vries, Kiky Heinsius and Loes Bueninck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verzetsmuseum.org/museum/nl/exposities/expositie-geen-nummers-maar-namen/publicatie Verzetsmuseum: ''Names instead of Numbers''] en [http://gedaechtnisbuch.de/namen-statt-nummern/english/index-engl.html ''Dachau Memorial Museum initiative'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The women were housed in an apartment block in München-Giesing. Part of the apartment had been bombed out before it was completed. The complex was surrounded by a high barbed wire fence with watch towers on the four corners. In the center court of the U-shaped building stood a wooden barrack mess hall. Six or seven prisoners slept in each small room. [[Reveille]] was at 0500 hours. The prisoners were counted, and marched to the Agfa factory. They returned to the subcamp compound at 1700 hours.

Religious meetings that had been held in Vught continued in secrecy in Dachau. One of the Dutch prisoners, ''Blockälteste'' Rennie van Ommen-de Vries, recalls the strength they obtained in these encounters in her biography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.TheMastmakersDaughters.us ''The Mastmakers' Daughters'']&lt;/ref&gt; Since the women were not under guard in their rooms, they held regular devotions and produced their own song books. They translated parts of the [[Old Testament]] from a German Bible that was lent to them by a civilian factory worker.

==The Strike==
In January, 1945 the {{convert|14|mi|0|km|adj=on|us=yes}} road from the main camp in Dachau had become impassable as a result of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings. The meals now became the responsibility of the Agfa management. The soup deteriorated by the day, and few women were spared digestive problems and complications from undernourishment. Disease was rampant: there were outbreaks of [[typhoid fever]], [[scarlet fever]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Conditions at the main camp were no better; as the war drew to a close, Dachau became increasingly overcrowded with prisoners evacuated from other concentration camps.  Consequently, transfer from the Agfa subcamp to the  to the main camp's dispensary was close to a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Bazyler, Frank M. Tuerkheimer, ''Forgotten Trials of the Holocaust,'' NYU Press, 2014, ISBN 9781479849932, pp. 77&amp;ndash;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the factory took over the distribution of the soup and started watering it down, while at the same time trying to raise the production quotas, the Dutch women spontaneously crossed their arms and stopped their work.&lt;ref name=Bartette /&gt; The Slovenian women joined the protest. Strikes were unheard of in the concentration camps, so this would lead to severe punishments. In the end the women made their point that they just could not work under the conditions of a starvation diet and constant bombing raids. The chief [[Gestapo]] agent Willy Bach&lt;ref&gt;Bavarian Historical Society, [http://www.hdbg.de/dachau/pdfs/13/13_02/13_02_01.PDF ''Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte: Dachau Trials''].&lt;/ref&gt; came down from the headquarters in Dachau and tried to find the instigators, but no one came forward. In the end, Mary Vaders, who had arrived from Ravensbrück on October 15, 1944,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Miscellaneous Lists and Registers of German Concentration Camp Inmates, &quot;Originated or Collected by the International Tracing Service.

The remaining Dutch and Slovenian women were punished with hours standing in formation in the court yard.

==The Liberation==
[[File:Gruenwald 2 BW.jpg|300px|thumb|Munich Airport: going home from Munich, pilot Lt. Col. Jay Vessels, Nel Niemantsverdriet and Rennie van Ommen-de Vries]]
[[File:Gruenwald14 BW.jpg|300px|thumb|Grünwald: Nel Niemantsverdriet, Harry Cowe, Rennie van Ommen-de Vries, Sgt. Nathan Asch]]
As the war drew to a close and American personnel began to encircle the region, production at the factory  halted on 23 April 1945. The Allied bombings and the advance of the Allied forces had cut off the supplies of raw material and distribution of the products. The camp commander was ordered to evacuate the prisoners and begin their [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] in a southerly direction.&lt;ref name=Stirnweistrial/&gt; The women were given a small sausage and a piece of bread for the journey, with their standard bowl of soup for their previous evening meal. Against his [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-superiors' orders, Stirnweis halted the march on 28 April just outside the town of Wolfratshausen and further persuaded a farmer named Walser to shelter the five hundred remaining prisoners in his hayloft. Despite specific orders to the contrary, he did not resume the march, but let the women shelter in place until the American troops drew closer.

On 1 May 1945 Stirnweis surrendered to the [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] of the US Army and asked for protection of the prisoners. After about a week on the farm, being fed by the generous Walser couple the women were relocated nearby, in the abandoned labor camp [[Föhrenwald]].  This was the largest and longest-lived [[Displaced persons camp|resettlement]] camp in post-war Europe. From Föhrenwald, the women were repatriated by the [[International Red Cross|Red Cross]].

===Trial of camp commander===
Initially, and based on cursory evidence, Stirnweis was accused of participating in cruelties and criminal usage of prisoners of war and civilians and sentenced to two years of labor after the war. However, the testimony of many of the women revealed no evidence of atrocities committed at the work detail at Agfa Camera works. According to former prisoners' testimony, sub-camp commander Lieutenant Kurt Konrad Stirnweis was a reasonable man. His sentence was abrogated upon the testimony of his former charges.&lt;ref name=Stirnweistrial/&gt;

His deputy, a 29-year-old [[Latvians|Latvian]] named Alexander Djerin,&lt;ref name=djerintrial&gt;Deputy Judge Advocate's Office, War Crimes Group European Command, United States v. Ludwig Philip Carl, et al. Case No. 000-50-2-46. [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/dachautrial/d48.pdf Dachau trial: Alexander Djerin] (22 July 1947, found on [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ Jewish Virtual Library], Accessed 15 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; was sentenced to six years imprisonment for his cruel treatment of the prisoners, commencing 9 May 1945. Although there was no suggestion in the trial records that Sergeant Djerin had mistreated the women, he was convicted of mistreatment of prisoners during his work at Dachau.

==The US War Press in Dachau==

In April 1945, a group of twenty-two [[war correspondent]]s was quartered in a villa on the [[Isar]] river in [[Grünwald, Bavaria|Grünwald]], another Munich suburb. Just before the women prisoners were transferred from the Walser farm to Föhrenwald, two of the men came looking for women to help in their kitchen. Rennie van Ommen-de Vries and Nel Niemantsverdriet accepted their offer.

Most of the correspondents had come up together from [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] through Italy. War correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]] and cartoonist [[Bill Mauldin]] often were among them. Their job was to document the atrocities of Dachau and to accompany government [[Very Important Person|VIPs]] and several Hollywood executives. One of the latter was film director [[William Wyler]].

The press was under the command of Colonel Max Boyd, his next in command was Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Jay R. Vessels (Minneapolis, Mn.), Air Corps Public Relations Officer. Claude Farmer was the driver and Don Jordan the cook. The journalists included [[Sholem Asch]]'s son, Nathan Asch; [[Associated Press|AP]] reporter working at the [[Seattle Times]] Harry Cowe;&lt;ref&gt;Rennie van Ommen's son Jack, who lives in the US, met Harry Cowe in Seattle in 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Charley Green (from St. Paul, Mn.); Art Everett (from Bay City, Mi.); and Paul Zimmer (from Oakland, Ca.).

'''Ball-bearing Run''' was the nickname of a war-time flight ''Stockholmsruten'' between Stockholm and  [[Leuchers]]. The flight was run by the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]], but for political reasons operated as an ordinary [[BOAC|BOAC Flight]], aircraft having civilian registration and the Norwegian military crew wearing BOAC uniforms and British passports.&lt;ref&gt;''Speedbird, the complete history of BOAC'' by Robert Higham&lt;/ref&gt;

The  Stockholmsruten was set up by the Norwegian Government, exiled in UK with the aim of transporting Norwegians having escaped from the [[German occupation of Norway|Nazi-occupied Norway]]. Several types of aircraft were used, but the backbone of Stockholmsruten was the [[Lockheed Lodestar]]

Since the aircraft also carried [[ball-bearing]]s, of greatest imporrtance to the British war industry, the flight got its nickname in UK.

The '''United Service Organizations Inc.''' ('''USO Show''') is a nonprofit organization that provides programs, services and live entertainment to United States service members and their families. Since 1941, it has worked in partnership with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), relying heavily on private contributions and on funds, goods, and services from various corporate and individual donors. Although it is [[US Congress|congressionally]]-chartered, it is not a government agency. The USO operates 160 centers worldwide.

During [[World War II]], the USO became the [[GI (military)|GI]]'s &quot;home away from home&quot; and began a tradition of entertaining the troops that continues today. Involvement in the USO was one of the many ways in which the nation had come together to support the war effort, with nearly 1.5 million Americans having volunteered their services in some way. After it was disbanded in 1947, it was revived in 1950 for the [[Korean War]], after which it also provided peacetime services. During the [[Vietnam War]], USOs were sometimes located in combat zones.

The organization became particularly famous for its live performances, called ''Camp Shows'', through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. [[Hollywood]] in general was eager to show its patriotism, and many famous celebrities joined the ranks of USO entertainers. They entertained in military bases at home and overseas, sometimes placing their own lives in danger, by traveling or performing under hazardous conditions.

The USO has over 160 locations around the world in 14 countries (including the U.S.) and 27 states. During a gala marking the USO's 75th anniversary in 2016, retired Army Gen. [[George W. Casey Jr.]], the current chairman of the USO Board of Governors, estimated that the USO has served more than 35 million Americans over its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/651462/from-world-war-ii-to-afghanistan-uso-marks-75th-anniversary &quot;From World War II to Afghanistan: USO Marks 75th Anniversary&quot;], Department of Defense, Feb. 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pat-gallagher/uso-anniversary_b_9133132.html &quot;Happy 75th Anniversary USO!&quot;], ''Huffington Post, Feb. 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Its motto is &quot;Until everyone comes home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfevr.org/carrolls-community/insights-marketers-managers/uso-until-everyone-comes-home/|title=Center for Elder Veterans Rights-USO – Until Everyone Comes Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mission and goals===
[[File:Uso-show-mickey-rooney.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Mickey Rooney]], a World War II Bronze Star recipient, honoring the USO in 2000]]

The USO was founded in 1941 by [[Mary Shotwell Ingraham|Mary Ingraham]] in response to a request from President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to provide morale and recreation services to U.S. uniformed military personnel. Roosevelt was elected as its honorary chairman. This request brought together six civilian organizations: the [[Salvation Army]], [[Young Men’s Christian Association]] (YMCA), [[Young Women’s Christian Association]] (YWCA), [[National Catholic Community Service]], [[National Travelers Aid Association]] and the [[National Jewish Welfare Board]]. They were brought together under one umbrella to support U.S. troops. Roosevelt said he wanted &quot;these private organizations to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces.&quot; According to historian Emily Yellin, &quot;The government was to build the buildings and the USO was to raise private funds to carry out its main mission: boosting the morale of the military.&quot;&lt;ref name=Yellin&gt;Yellin, Emily. ''Our Mothers' War: American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II'', Simon and Schuster (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first national campaign chairman was [[Thomas Dewey]], who raised $16 million in the first year. The second chairman was future senator [[Prescott Bush]].&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; The USO was incorporated in New York on February 4,&lt;ref name=&quot;USO Historical Timeline&quot;/&gt; with the first facility erected in DeRidder, Louisiana,1941.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers II. &quot;USO.&quot; ''The Oxford Companion to American Military History''. Oxford University Press (2000), [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O126-USO.html highbeam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Bill. ''High Hat Sam: The Life and Times of Louisiana Governor Sam Houston Jones''. Springfield, Missouri : James E. Cornwell, 2014. p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; More USO centers and clubs opened around the world as a “Home Away from Home” for [[GI (military)|GIs]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The USO club was a place to go for dances and social events, for movies and music, for a quiet place to talk or write a letter home, or for a free cup of coffee and an egg.

The USO also brought [[Hollywood]] celebrities and [[volunteer]] entertainers to perform for the troops. According to movie historian Steven Cohan, &quot;most of all ... in taking home on the road, it equated the nation with showbiz. USO camp shows were designed in their export to remind soldiers of home.&quot; They did this, he noted, by &quot;nurturing in troops a sense of patriotic identification with America through popular entertainment.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cohan&gt;Cohan, Steven. ''The Road Movie Book'', Routledge (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''Look'' magazine at the time, stated, &quot;For the little time the show lasts, the men are taken straight to the familiar Main Street that is the goal of every fighting American far away from home.&quot; [[Maxene Andrews]] wrote, &quot;The entertainment brought home to the boys. ''Their'' home.&quot; Actor [[George Raft]] stated at the beginning of the war, &quot;Now it's going to be up to us to send to the men here and abroad real, living entertainment, the songs, the dances, and the laughs they had back home.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt;

USO promotional literature stated its goals:

:&quot;The story of USO camp shows belongs to the American people, for it was their contribution that made it possible. It is an important part in the life of your sons, your brothers, your husbands, and your sweethearts.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt;

===World War II===
[[Image:Hope WWII 44.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Hope]] USO show, 1944]]

After being formed in 1941, in response to World War II, &quot;centers were established quickly... in churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, castles, beach clubs, and log cabins.&quot;&lt;ref name=Clairday&gt;Clairday, Robynn. ''Postcards from World War II'', Square One Publishers (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Most centers offered recreational activities, such as holding dances and showing movies. And there were the well-known free coffee and doughnuts. Some USO bases provided a haven for spending a quiet moment alone or writing a letter home, while others offered spiritual guidance and made childcare available for military wives.

But the organization became mostly known for its live performances called ''Camp Shows'', through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. Camp Shows began in October 1941, and by that fall and winter 186 military theaters existed in the United States. Overseas shows began in November 1941 with a tour of the Caribbean. Within five months 36 overseas units had been sent within the Americas, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and during 1942 1,000 performed as part of 70 units. Average performers were paid $100 a week; top stars were paid $10 a day because their wealth let them contribute more of their talents.{{r|jstor3204158}}

These overseas shows were produced by the American Theatre Wing, which also provided food and entertainment for the armed services in their Stage Door Canteens. Funds from the sale of film rights for a story about the New York Canteen went toward providing USO tours of shows for overseas troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/history/perry.html |title=Who is 'Tony'? - TonyAwards.com - The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards® - Official Website by IBM |publisher=TonyAwards.com |date=1946-06-28 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944, [[Edward G. Robinson]] was first movie star to travel to Normandy to entertain the troops.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven J., [http://www.usc.edu/vh/tfm/autumn-2011/little-caesar-and-the-mccarthyist-mob.1.html &quot;Little Caesar and the McCarthyist Mob&quot;], USC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2d/6d/77/2d6d77eeb0ab767294a28c6d8d05b836.jpg Photo of Edward G. Robinson entertaining troops in Normandy]&lt;/ref&gt; He had already been active back home selling war bonds, and donated $100,000 to the USO. During his show, he said, &quot;This is the most privileged moment of my life, the opportunity to be here with you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Edward G. ''All My Yesterdays'', Hawthorn Books (1973) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Camp Shows began in Normandy. 

Until fall 1944 overseas units contained five performers or fewer; ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'', using local theaters in France and Italy, was the first to use an entire theater company, including scenery.{{r|jstor3204158}} At its high point in 1944, the USO had more than 3,000 clubs, and curtains were rising on USO shows 700 times a day. The USO's fundraising efforts were controversial. An [[MGM]] film, ''Mr. Gardenia Jones'', created to assist the USO in its fundraising campaign, was nearly withdrawn from theaters due to objections by the War Department , mainly because of scenes showing soldiers jumping with joy at the opportunity to shower in canteens and rest in overstuffed and comfortable USO chairs. The Army, noted the ''[[New York Times]]'', &quot;feels this is not good for morale as it implies that there are no showers or other comforts for soldiers in military camps.&quot; The film starred [[Ronald Reagan]], then a captain in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Thomas. ''New York Times'', June 28, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundraising was also aided by non-USO entertainment groups. Soldier Shows, which troops&amp;mdash;often experienced actors and musicians&amp;mdash;organized and held their own performances, were common. The army formed a [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] unit that organized such shows and supervised the USO, and the experience from the Soldier Shows led to [[Irving Berlin]]'s Broadway show ''[[This Is the Army]]''. Performers and writers from throughout the army were recruited for the production; they remained soldiers and continued drills. Berlin, who had written and produced the similar ''[[Yip, Yip, Yaphank]]'' during World War I, took the entire 165-person cast on tour in Europe in 1942, raising nearly $10 million for the [[Army Emergency Relief]] Fund. The following year the show was made into a film by the same title, again starring Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt;{{r|jstor3204158}} One of the highlights of the film was its introduction of Berlin's song, &quot;[[God Bless America]],&quot; considered one of the nation's most patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|09Gj7mJbPPc|&quot;God Bless America&quot; sung by Kate Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''This Is The Army'' stage production toured worldwide until it closed in October 1945 in Honolulu.{{r|jstor3204158}}

War correspondent Quentin Reynolds, in an article for ''[[Billboard magazine]]'' in 1943, wrote, &quot;Entertainment, all phases of it -- radio, pictures and live -- should be treated as essential. You don't know what entertainment means to the guys who do the fighting until you've been up there with the men yourself. . . . You can quote me as saying that we should use entertainment as an essential industry so long as it's for the boys in service. Anybody who has been there would insist on it. . . . Hell, you should have seen how happy the G.I.'s were when they heard the ballplayers were coming over. And [[John Steinbeck]], just back from a chore as war correspondent, . . . also applauded show business as part of the war effort and its importance as a morale builder.&quot;&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vwwEAAAAMBAJ &quot;Quentin Reynolds Talks on Terrific Job Big and Little Showbiz is Doing Overseas&quot;], ''Billboard'', Oct. 30, 1943 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Irving Berlin aboard the USS Arkansas, 944.jpg|thumb|[[Irving Berlin]] singing aboard [[USS Arkansas (BB-33)|USS ''Arkansas'']], 1944]]
According to historian Paul Holsinger, between 1941 and 1945, the USO did 293,738 performances in 208,178 separate visits. Estimates were that more than 161 million servicemen and women, in the U.S. and abroad, were entertained. The USO also did shows in military hospitals, eventually entertaining more than 3 million wounded soldiers and sailors in 192 different hospitals. There were 702 different USO troupes that toured the world, some spending up to six months per tour.&lt;ref name=Holsinger&gt;Holsinger, Paul. ''War and American Popular Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia'', Greenwood Publishing Group (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, a [[United States]] [[Liberty ship]] named the [[SS U.S.O.|SS ''U.S.O.]] was launched. She was scrapped in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/116liberty_victory_ships/116facts1.htm Reading 1: Liberty Ships] ''[[National Park Service]] Cultural Resources.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-eight performers died in the course of their tours, from plane crashes, illness, or diseases contracted while on tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor3204158&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matson | first1 = Lowell | last2 = | first2 = | year = 1954 | title = Theatre for the Armed Forces in World War II | journal = Educational Theatre Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | publisher = | doi = 10.2307/3204158 | jstor = 3204158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such instance in 1943, a plane carrying a U.S.O. troupe crashed outside [[Lisbon]], killing singer and actress [[Tamara Drasin]], and severely injuring Broadway singer [[Jane Froman]]. Froman returned to Europe on crutches in 1945 to again entertain the troops. She later married the co-pilot who saved her life in that crash, and her story was made into the 1952 film ''[[With a Song in My Heart (film)|With a Song in My Heart]]'', with Froman providing the actual singing voice.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, Richard. [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/answers-about-world-war-ii-in-new-york/ &quot;Answers About World War II in New York&quot;] ''New York Times'', Sept. 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Al Jolson]], the first entertainer to go overseas in World War II, contracted malaria, resulting in the loss of his lung, cutting short his tour.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Martin. [http://jolsonville.net/articles/world-war-ii-tours/ &quot;Jolson Sings Again&quot;], ''The Real Al Jolson'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

One author wrote that by the end of the war &quot;the USO amounted to the biggest enterprise American show business has ever tackled. The audience was millions of American fighting men, the theatre's location: the world, the producer: USO camp shows&quot;&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt; Performances continued after the end of the war in 1945. 60 new units went to Europe after [[V-E Day]], and 91 new units went to the Pacific after [[V-J Day]]. The USO dissolved in December 1947, after having spent $240 million in contributions on Camp Shows, canteens, and other services. Special Services productions grew in number as replacement.{{r|jstor3204158}}

In 1991, [[20th Century Fox]] produced the film, ''[[For the Boys]]'', which told the story of two USO performers, and starred [[Bette Midler]] and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]]. It covered a 50-year timespan, from the USO's inception in 1941 through [[Operation Desert Storm]], in 1991. Another movie was planned in 1950 but never made. Just 10 days after [[Al Jolson]] returned from entertaining troops in Korea, he agreed with [[RKO]] producers to star in a new movie, ''Stars and Stripes for Ever,'' about a [[U.S.O.]] troupe in the South Pacific during World War II. Unfortunately, he died a week later as a result of physical exhaustion from his tour.

====Women in the USO====
[[File:USO Girls Airventure 2013.jpg|thumb|left|USO women from the World War II era ([[reenactment]])]]

According to Emily Yellin, many of the key foot soldiers in the USO's mission were women who were &quot;charged with providing friendly diversion for U.S. troops who were mostly men in their teens and twenties.&quot;&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; USO centers throughout the world recruited female volunteers to serve doughnuts, dance, and just talk with the troops. USO historian Julia Carson writes that this &quot;nostalgic hour,&quot; designed to cheer and comfort soldiers, involved &quot;listening to music – American style&quot; and &quot;looking at pretty girls, like no other pretty girls in the world – American girls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Julia. ''Home Away From Home: The Story of the USO'', Harper &amp; Brothers (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American women scrambled to rally the community around the soldiers and create programs for them. By 1946, hostesses had served more than two thousand soldiers a day while also providing facilities for the wounded and convalescent who were on leave. They went to black businesses and fraternal organizations in order to find sponsorship for their USO group, and later expanded to fulfill the needs of soldiers during the Korean War. Moreover, they worked to merge black and white USOs into one desegregated unit. As black historian Megan Shockley noted, &quot;Their work for the desegregation of USOs had begun during World War II, and it finally paid off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shockley, Megan Taylor. ''We, Too, are Americans: African American Women in Detroit and Richmond, 1940-55'', Univ. of Illinois Press (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also key entertainers who performed at shows. Stars such as [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Betty Grable]] and [[Rita Hayworth]] had traveled over a million miles. Yellin notes that on one tour, Hayworth visited six camps, gave thousands of autographs, and &quot;came back from Texas with a full-fledged nervous breakdown from over-enthusiasm!&quot;&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; Opera singer [[Lily Pons]], after she had performed a &quot;serious&quot; opera song to troops in [[Burma]], &quot;an applause erupted that stunned even the most seasoned performers.&quot; She later wrote in a letter, &quot;Every woman back home wears a halo now, and those who represent her had better keep theirs on, too.&quot;&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;

Author Joeie Dee pointed out that &quot;for women entertainers, traveling with the USO made it possible to be patriots and adventurers as well as professionals.&quot; She adds, however, that the G.I.s in the USO audiences &quot;tended to see these women in a different light – as reminders of and even substitutes for their girls back home, as a reward for fighting the war, as embodiments of what they were fighting for.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dee&gt;Dee, Joeie. ''Hi GI'', Xulon Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Skvarna remembers 1943, when he met [[Donna Reed]] at a U.S.O. canteen and asked her to dance. &quot;I had never danced with a celebrity before, so I felt delighted, privileged even, to meet her.... But I really felt she was like a girl from back home.&quot; Jay Fultz, author of her biography, states that soldiers &quot;often wrote to her as if to a sister or the girl next door, confiding moments of homesickness, loneliness, privation and anxiety.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/arts/25donna.html?pagewanted=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th &quot;Dear Donna: A Pinup So Swell She Kept G.I.

====Women entertainers====
[[Image:USO Vietnam70.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard, 1st show in Vietnam, 1970]]

One female entertainer wrote about conditions while performing:
:&quot;We've played to audiences, many of them ankle deep in mud, huddled under the ponchos in the pouring rain (it breaks your heart the first two or three times to see men so hungry for entertainment.) We've played on uncovered stages, when we, as well as the audience, got rain-soaked. We've played with huge tropical bugs flying in our hair and faces; we've played to audiences of thousands of men, audiences spreading from our very feet to far up a hillside and many sitting in the trees. . . . We've played to audiences in small units of 500 or so, and much oftener to audiences of 8 to 10,000. Every night we play a different place.&quot;&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;

Singer and dancer [[Ann Miller]] described performing for badly wounded soldiers. She did forty-eight shows for &quot;broken soldiers,&quot; who were mostly lying on stretchers in the lobbies of hotels, watching as she entertained them. Yellin writes, &quot;During her last show she collapsed and had to be taken home on an Army airplane.&quot;&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; Afterwards, Miller described the experience:

:&quot;We went from ward to ward to ward, singing and dancing and trying to boost the morale of these men. It was just hell. . . . I just fell apart and I think the shock of seeing those men with their arms and legs blown off - it was just frightening. But when you do it, you do it. You try to help them, try to sing and dance. You try to keep their spirits up. It's heartbreaking.&quot;&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;

In November and December 1968 Jennie and [http://sedonasevenarcheslive.com/terrie-s-uso---veteran-connection.html Terrie Frankel] (Doublemint Twins) performed in Vietnam with the USO - Hollywood Overseas Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/bib/78282|title=Terrie Maxine Frankel Collection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were shepherded around Vietnam by Escort Officers (USO Performers were given GS15 ratings, equivalent to Generals, to help maintain their safety) to entertain troops in the boonies where larger USO shows could not perform.

===Korean War===
[[File:Jolson-Korea.jpg|thumb|[[Al Jolson]], the first star to perform in Korea, September 17, 1950]]
In 1947, the USO was disbanded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uso.org/history.aspx/|title=The Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due partly to lack of funds.&lt;ref name=Freedland&gt;Freedland, Michael. ''The Story of Al Jolson '' (1972), pp. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, when the United States entered the Korean War, Secretary of Defense [[George Marshall]] and Secretary of the Navy [[Francis P. Matthews]] requested that the USO be reactivated &quot;to provide support for the men and women of the armed forces with help of the American people.&quot; According to war historian Paul Edwards, Between 1952 and 1953, not a day went by without the USO providing services somewhere in Korea. At home or overseas, in 1952 it was serving 3.5 million in the armed forces using much the same methods of operation as it did in World War II.

Many stars, both well-known and new, came to perform, including [[Bob Hope]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Donald O'Connor]], [[Piper Laurie]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Rory Calhoun]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Al Jolson#World War II and Korean War tours|Al Jolson]] and many others. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Military|Hispanic-American soldiers]] were entertained by artists such as [[Dámaso Pérez Prado|Pérez Prado]]'s Show featuring [[Evita Muñoz]] as his invited [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]] dancer. Jolson was the first to volunteer, but due to lack of USO funds traveled to Korea at his own expense&lt;ref&gt;Akst, Harry [http://jolsonville.net/articles/korean-war-tours/first-stop-tokyo/ &quot;The Jolson Nobody Knew&quot;], ''Cosmopolitan'', January, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; (he was also the first to entertain troops during World War II.).&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, S.J.

[[File:Marilyn Monroe - 1954.JPG|thumb|left|[[Marilyn Monroe]] performing in Korea, 1954]]
Veterans have recalled many of the USOs events, sometimes in vivid detail:

:&quot;On that cold, overcast day, there were more than five thousand troops in the audience. They sat on the ground or up on the hillside. When everyone was settled, [[Danny Kaye]] opened the show by going to the microphone, looking at his large audience, and shouting, &quot;Who's holding back the enemy?&quot; The GIs roared with laughter. We were thrilled to have Kaye and his entertainers in our area. We especially liked the young women in the show. Danny was okay, with his stories and jokes, but after all, we knew what American men looked like.&quot;&lt;ref name=Granfield&gt;Granfield, Linda. ''I Remember Korea: Veterans Tell Their Stories of the Korean War, 1950-53'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}}

Author Linda Granfield in describing the show, writes, &quot;For two hours, the men could forget they were soldiers at war. After the show, they returned to the fighting in the hills. Some in that audience never made it back.&quot;&lt;ref name=Granfield/&gt; By the end of the war, over 113,000 American USO volunteers were working at 294 centers at home and abroad.&quot;&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, Paul M. ''The Korean War'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; And 126 units had given 5,422 performances to servicemen in Korea and the wounded in Japan
'''

===Vietnam War===
The USO was in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] before the first combat troops arrived, with the first USO club opened in Saigon in April 1963. The 23 centers in Vietnam and [[Thailand]] served as many as a million service members a month, and the USO presented more than 5,000 performances during the [[Vietnam War]] featuring stars such as [[John Wayne]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Raymond Burr]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Martha Raye]], [[Joey Heatherton]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Rosey Grier]], [[Anita Bryant]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[Jimmy Boyd]], [[Lola Falana]], [[George Peppard]] and [[Bob Hope]]. [[Philip Ahn]], the first actor of Korean descent to become a Hollywood star, became the first Asian American USO performer to entertain troops in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Hye Seung. ''Hollywood Asian'', Temple Univ. Press (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thousands of service personnel listen to Miss Ann-Margret sing one of her numbers during her show in Danang, Vietnam. - NARA - 532506.tiff|thumb|px240|[[Ann-Margret]] performing in Vietnam, 1966]]
[[File:USO Show Vietnam 1968 Terrie Frankel, Sara Sue, 3 Soldiers, Jennie Frankel.jpg|thumb|USO Show Vietnam 1968 Terrie Frankel, Sara Sue, 3 Soldiers, Jennie Frankel]]

In addition, the USO operated centers at major U.S. airports to provide a lounge and place to sleep for American servicemen between their flights. Vietnam historian James Westheider noted that the USO &quot;tried to bring a little America to Vietnam.&quot; Volunteer American civilians, who did 18-month tours, staffed the clubs. According to Westheider, &quot;The young women wore miniskirts - no slacks were allowed.&quot; Each club had a snack bar, gift shops, a barbershop, photo developing, overseas phone lines, and hot showers.&lt;ref name=Westheider&gt;Westheider, James E. ''The Vietnam War'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

When providing entertainment, the USO did its best to attract known stars from back home to help relieve the stresses of war. Senator [[John Kerry]] recalled how important this kind of diversion would become. He remembered a &quot;Bob Hope Follies&quot; USO show, which included actress [[Ann-Margret]], Miss America, football star [[Rosey Grier]], and others. According to Kerry biographer Douglas Brinkley, &quot;When the Swift finally made it back to the My Tho River, the crew confronted the heartbreaking sight of a huge Navy landing craft ferrying the troops back. The USO show was over.&quot; Kerry later wrote, &quot;The visions of Ann Margret and Miss America and all the other titillating personalities who would have made us feel so at home hung around us for a while until we saw three Chinook helicopters take off from the field and presumed that our dreams had gone with them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Douglas. ''Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War'' HarperCollins (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

But for GIs who saw the show, it was worth it: &quot;We turned to watch Ann perform, and for about two minutes of American beauty, the war was forgotten. Everyone fully understood just what was really worth fighting for. . . . The show was fantastic, but the escape the Bob Hope tour provided us in expectation for days before, and after, helped us keep in touch with what we were there for -- God, Country, apple pie ... and Ann-Margret!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.war-stories.com/aspprotect/dn-poss-bob-hope-1966-2.asp War-Stories.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The visits by the stars meant a lot to the men and women in Vietnam. &quot;It was not just the entertainment; it meant that they were not forgotten that far away from home,&quot; writes Westheider.&lt;ref name=Westheider/&gt; He adds that the tours made a &quot;deep impression&quot; on the stars as well. Singer and actress [[Connie Stevens]] remembered her 1969 tour with Bob Hope, when she decided to go despite the fact she had two children both under the age of two. Today, she claims that &quot;veterans were still stopping her and thanking her for visiting Vietnam over 30 years later.&quot;&lt;ref name=Westheider/&gt;

Similarly, [[Ann-Margret]] during a book signing was approached by a veteran who asked her to sign a photo he took of her performing in Vietnam. Although the book's publishing representative for the signing event would not allow her to sign anything other than her book, the veteran's wife recalls:

{{quote|She took one look at the photo, tears welled up in her eyes, and she said, 'This is one of my gentlemen from Viet Nam and I most certainly will sign his photo. I know what these men did for their country and I always have time for 'my gentlemen.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://jdeaustcp.blogspot.com/2013/04/ann-margret-real-woman-of-year.html &quot;Ann-Margret ... The Real WOMAN OF THE YEAR&quot;], jdeaustocp blog, April 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November–December 1968 the Sig Sakowitz troop from Chicago performed over 36 shows in South Vietnam with the USO in: Pleiku, Dalat, Danang, Cam Ran Bay, Phu Bai, Phu Loy, Hue, Natrang, Tan Son Nhut Airbase, Saigon and places in the boonies known only to military intelligence and the lonely soldiers yearning for a taste of home. The troop consisted of Doublemint Twins Terrie and Jennie Frankel, Gaslight Club singer Sara Sue, Comedian Tony Diamond and personality Sig Sakowitz. Shows were also performed with comedian Joey Bishop of the Rat Pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.78282/ |title=Terrie Maxine Frankel: Digital Collection: Veterans History Project (Library of Congress) |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Peppard, successful star of stage, TV and motion pictures, arrived in Vietnam for a USO HANDSHAKE TOUR in 1970 to visit the military in the hospitals and out in the “boonies.” ...He showed a keen interest in the men’s mission while they were hungry for news of life back in the “World.” ... Polaroid pictures were taken by Mr. Peppard’s escort officer, autographed, and given to the men.&lt;ref&gt;Credit U.S.O. Photo/Vietnam&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a bloody [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]] was raging in [[Lebanon]]. In an effort to stop the violence in the region a [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Multinational Force]] of [[Peacekeeping|peacekeeper]]s composed largely of U.S., Italian and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order.

===Afghanistan and Iraq===
To support troops participating in Operations [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Enduring Freedom]] and [[Iraqi Freedom]], USO centers opened in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Qatar]]. USO centers number more than 160 around the world. Recently{{when|date=January 2012}}, the USO opened centers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Riley, Kansas; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Carson, Colorado; and Afghanistan. The USO provides a variety of programs and services, including orientation programs, family events, free Internet and e-mail access, free drinks and snacks, free phone calls home and recreation services. One of the newer programs, called &quot;USO in a Box,&quot; delivers program materials ranging from DVD players and videos to musical instruments to remote forward operating bases in Afghanistan.

U.S. military personnel and their families visit USO centers more than eight million times each year.

On July 16, 2012, Hollywood actor [[Charlie Sheen]] announced that he would donate at least $1 million to the USO. This would be among the largest single monetary donations ever given to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actor Charlie Sheen gives $1M to troops, USO|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/actor-charlie-sheen-gives-1m-troops-uso|publisher=CNS News|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honoring Bob Hope==
In 1997, the U.S. Congress honored [[Bob Hope]] by declaring him the &quot;first and only honorary veteran of the U.S. armed forces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://armylive.dodlive.mil/index.php/2014/08/bob-hope-first-and-only-honorary-veteran-of-the-armed-forces/ &quot;Bob Hope: First and only honorary veteran of the Armed Forces&quot;], ''Army Live'', August 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faith&gt;Faith, William. ''Bob Hope: A Life in Comedy'', Da Capo Press (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hope biographer William Faith, his reputation has become ingrained in the &quot;American consciousness&quot; because he had flown millions of miles to entertain G.I.s during both wartime and peace. His contribution to the USO began in 1941 and ended with [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]] in 1991, spending 48 [[Christmas]]es overseas with American service personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaroldaSchneller&quot;/&gt; He was always treated as &quot;an asset to the U.S. Government with his willingness to entertain whenever they needed him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt; After WWII was declared over, the USO had sent out an &quot;impassioned bulletin&quot; asking entertainers not to abandon the GIs now that the war was over. Hope was among the first to say yes. The [[Military Order of the Purple Heart]] notes that &quot;his contributions to the USO are well known: they are legend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Military Order of the Purple Heart, ''Legacy of the Purple Heart'', 4th Ed., Turner Publishing Co. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his non-stop entertainment to both the civilian population and the military, he received numerous other honors over the years: a [[C-17 Globemaster III|C-17 Air Force plane]] was named ''The Spirit of Bob Hope''; a naval vessel was named the ''[[USNS Bob Hope]]''; and streets, schools, hospitals, and a golf tournament were also named in his honor. A Senate resolution declared him &quot;a part of American folklore.&quot; The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' called him the most honored entertainer ever.  And during his 1993 televised birthday celebration, when he turned 90, [[General Colin Powell]] saluted Hope &quot;for his tireless USO trouping&quot;, which was followed by onstage tributes from all branches of the armed forces. [[General William Westmoreland]] spoke about his loyalty to the GI throughout the gritty Vietnam years. And bandleader [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], who was with him during many of his tours, mentioned that his band &quot;had seen more of Hope's ass in the last forty years than any of Hope's immediate family.&quot;&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt;

War correspondent Quentin Reynolds wrote in 1943, &quot;He and his troupe would do 300 miles in a jeep, and give four shows... One of the generals said Hope was a first rate military target since he was worth a division; that that's about 15,000 men. Presumably the Nazis appreciated Hope's value, since they thrice bombed towns while the comic was there.&quot;&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

During the Vietnam War years he gave a number of high-rating television specials and sensed that the media had given him a broad endorsement for continuing on his GI mercy missions. Soon after his Christmas show in Saigon in 1967, he learned that the [[Vietcong]] had planned a terrorist attack at his hotel against him and his entire troupe, missing him by ten minutes. He was later &quot;mystified,&quot; writes Faith, &quot;and ... increasingly intolerant of the pockets of dissent. [[Draft-card burning]]s on college campuses angered him...&quot; &quot;Can you imagine,&quot; Hope wrote in a magazine article, &quot;... that people in America are burning their draft cards to show their opposition and that some of them are actually rooting for your defeat?&quot;&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt; In the spring of 1973, Hope began writing his fifth book, ''The Last Christmas Show'', which was dedicated to &quot;the men and women of the armed forces and to those who also served by worrying and waiting.&quot; He signed over his royalties to the USO.

His final Christmas show was during [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]] in 1990. The show was not easy, notes Faith. &quot;There were so many restrictions. Hope's jokes were monitored by the State Department to avoid offending the Saudis... and the media was restricted from covering the shows... Because in Saudi Arabia national custom prescribes that women must be veiled in public, [[Ann Jillian]], [[Marie Osmond]], and the [[Pointer Sisters]] were left off Hope's Christmas Eve show.&quot;&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt;

In 2009, [[Stephen Colbert]] performing his last episode of weeklong taping in Iraq for his [[The Colbert Report]] show, carried a golf club on stage and dedicated it to [[Bob Hope]]'s service for the USO.

==Financial matters==
The USO has a paid staff of approximately 300. Additionally, more than 44,000 USO volunteers provide an estimated 371,417 hours of service annually. As reported by the USO, the unpaid volunteer to paid employee ratio overseas is 20 to 1. Within the United States, the number is &quot;significantly higher.&quot;

The following information is based on USO's audited financial statements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uso.org/financial-statements.aspx USO.org]&lt;/ref&gt; for the year ended December 31, 2011:

In [[World War II]], children frequently fought in insurrections in both the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces.

In World War II, the youngest member of the [[United States military]] was 12-year-old [[Calvin Graham]]. He lied about his age when he enlisted in the [[US Navy]], and his real age was not known until after he was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://armedforcesmuseum.com/interesting-facts-about-world-war-ii/ &quot;Interesting Facts About World War II&quot;], ''Armed Forces History Museum'', Retrieved on 10 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States military was not the sole recruiter, albeit unintentionally or intentionally, of underage child soldiers during World War II.

==Legality of child soldiers==

The legality relating to the use of children in armed conflicts, as soldiers or in other capacities, has changed significantly in the last century.

Following [[World War I]], in 1924 the [[League of Nations]] adopted the [[Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/gdrc1924.htm &quot;Geneva Declaration on the Rights of the Child&quot;], ''UN Documents'', Retrieved on 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this attempt to protect children's rights, stating they must be &quot;protected against every form of exploitation,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/gdrc1924.htm &quot;Geneva Declaration on the Rights of the Child&quot;], ''UN Documents'', Retrieved on 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the rise of fascism that led to the start of World War II left millions of children again unprotected – gassed, killed or orphaned.&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children. [http://www.childrensrightswales.org.uk/history-of-children-rights.aspx &quot;History of children’s human rights&quot;], ''Children's Rights in Wales: United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child'', Retrieved on 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of a child==

The lack of legal protection for children in times of war, which allows for their exploitation, can be linked to the lack of a universally recognised definition of a child during World War II.

Prior to the creation of the United Nations during World War II, protection of child welfare was predominantly embodied in the laws of war, [[jus in bello]].&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Myra. [http://www.sju.ca/sites/default/files/Library/Headley%20essays/Khan_headley_essay.pdf &quot;International Laws Concerning the Recruitment and Use of Child Soldiers and the Case of Omar Khadr&quot;], ''St Jerome's University'', Retrieved on 13 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These laws sought to outlaw war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/5kzjjd.htm &quot;What are Jus in Bello and Jus ad Bellum?&quot;], ''International Committee of the Red Cross: Resource Centre'', Retrieved on 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to protecting the rights of children involved in conflict, however, this concept failed to address the concept of a [[child-soldier]] at the time of World War II.

Furthermore, there was essentially no criminal culpability placed on the child where a breach of jus in bello occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Yesduas, Michelle. [http://www.academia.edu/3648839/The_beautiful_soldiers_A_piece_on_child_soldiers_humanitarian_law_and_a_critique_of_modernity_s_discourse_of_childhood &quot;The Beautiful Soldiers: A piece on child soldiers, humanitarian law and a critique of modernity’s discourse of childhood&quot;], ''Academia.edu'', Retrieved on 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; No legal limits excluded children being involved in armed conflicts, nor was there any definition of what a child was in relation to their ability to be involved in conflicts.

==Hitler Youth==

[[Hitler Youth]] (''Hitlerjugend'') was established as an organiation in [[Nazi]] Germany that physically trained youth and indoctrinated them with Nazi ideology to the point of [[fanaticism]]. Even at the onset of war, Hitler Youth totalled 8.8&amp;nbsp;million members. Numbers decreased significantly (to just over one million) once the war began as many local and district leaders were drafted for the national army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm &quot;Hitler Youth&quot;], ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 15 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous average age for local and district leaders was 24, but following the onset of war, this had to change to those who were 16 and 17 years of age. These youths were in command of up to 500 boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm &quot;Hitler Youth&quot;], ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 15 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Hitler Youth soldier, Heinz Shuetze aged 15 from [[Leipzig]], was only given a half-day of training with a primitive form of tank-killing rocket. He was immediately given an [[SS]] uniform and directed to the front lines to fight.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Allan. [http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/469496/Grim-fate-of-Nazi-child-soldiers-rounded-up-from-school-revealed-in-new-book &quot;Revealed: The Tragedy of the Nazi Child soldiers rounded up from school&quot;], ''Express'', Retrieved on 17 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huge numbers of youths were removed from school in early 1945, and sent on, essentially, suicide missions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/469496/Grim-fate-of-Nazi-child-soldiers-rounded-up-from-school-revealed-in-new-book &quot;Revealed: The Tragedy of the Nazi Child soldiers rounded up from school&quot;], ''Express'', Retrieved on 17 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler Youth activities often included learning to throw grenades, dig trenches, bayonet drills and escaping under barbed wire under pistol fire and, while doing so boys were encouraged to find these activities exhilarating and exciting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/workspaces/show/BritishPathe/Hitler-Youth/full &quot;The Hitler Youth&quot;], ''British Pathé'', Retrieved on 20 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler Youth was essentially an army of fit, young Germans that Hitler had created, trained to fight for their country. They had the choice to either follow Nazi party orders or face trial with the possibility of execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/workspaces/show/BritishPathe/Hitler-Youth/full &quot;The Hitler Youth&quot;], ''British Pathé'', Retrieved on 20 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The boys of Hitler Youth first saw action following the British Air Raids in Berlin in 1940. Later, in 1942, the Wehrertüchtigungslager or WELS (Defense Strengthening Camps) were created in Germany, which were designed to train Hitler Youth boys aged 16–18. They learnt how to handle German infantry weaponry, including hand grenades, machine guns and hand pistols. By 1943, Hitler Youth boys were facing the forces of Britain, the United States and [[Soviet Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm &quot;Hitler Youth&quot;], ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even younger boys from the ages of 10–14 years could be involved in the Hitler Youth movement, under the [[Deutsches Jungvolk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/workspaces/show/BritishPathe/Hitler-Youth/full &quot;The Hitler Youth&quot;], ''British Pathé'', Retrieved on 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls were also involved in Hitler Youth Operations, although in a limited capacity, through the [[Bund Deutscher Mädel]] (BDM, the [[League of German Girls]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/workspaces/show/BritishPathe/Hitler-Youth/full &quot;The Hitler Youth&quot;], ''British Pathé'', Retrieved on 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding direct armed conflict, their primary role was to produce healthy, racially pure baby boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm &quot;Hitler Youth&quot;], ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 20 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also required to run 60 metres in 14 seconds, throw a ball at least 12 metres, march for 2 hours and swim 100 metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm, ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 19 April 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==SS Youth Division==

Towards the end of the War, the Germans established an entire SS Panzer Tank Division with the majority of its recruits being 16 and 17-year-old boys from the Hitler Youth brigades.&lt;ref&gt;Eigen, Louis D. [http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/child-soldiers-are-unfortunately-nothing-new/ &quot;Child Soldiers Are Unfortunately Nothing New&quot;], ''Scriptamus'', Retrieved on 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st Battalion over 65% were under 18 years old, and only 3% were over 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-12th-ss-hitlerjugend-panzer-division-fought-in-normandy.htm &quot;World War II: 12th SS HitlerJugend Panzer Division Fought in Normandy&quot;], ''HistoryNet'', Retrieved on 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There were more than 10,000 boys in this division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm &quot;Hitler Youth&quot;], ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 20 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[12th SS Panzer Division]] of the [[Hitlerjugend]], was established later in World War II as Germany suffered more casualties, and more young people volunteered, initially as reserves, but soon joined front line troops. These children saw extensive action and were among the fiercest and most effective German defenders in the [[Battle of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/child-soldiers-are-unfortunately-nothing-new/ &quot;Child Soldiers Are Unfortunately Nothing New&quot;], ''Scriptamus'', Retrieved on 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the battle of the [[Normandy]] beaches, the division had suffered 60% casualties, most of whom were teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;Latimer, John. [http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-12th-ss-hitlerjugend-panzer-division-fought-in-normandy.htm &quot;World War II: 12th SS HitlerJugend Panzer Division Fought in Normandy&quot;], ''HistoryNet'', Retrieved on 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

These fearsome young boy soldiers acquired a formidable reputation for their violent and unforgiving practice, shooting prisoners, and were responsible for 64 deaths of British and Canadian soldiers between 7–16 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm &quot;Hitler Youth&quot;], ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other German involvement==

In late 1944, the [[Volkssturm|People's Army]] was formed (&quot;Volkssturm&quot;) in anticipation of an Allied invasion. Men of all ages, from 16–60 were conscripted into this army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm &quot;Hitler Youth&quot;], ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 21 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children as young as 8 were reported to be captured by American troops, with boys aged 12 and under to man artillery units. Even girls were being placed in armed combat, operating the 88mm anti-aircraft guns alongside the boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-boy-soldiers.htm &quot;Hitler Youth&quot;], ''The History Place'', Retrieved on 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish Resistance==

During [[the Holocaust]], Jews of all ages participated in the [[Jewish resistance under Nazi rule|Jewish resistance]] simply to survive. Most Jewish Resistance took place after 1942 when the Nazi atrocities became clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005441 &quot;Armed Jewish Resistance: Partisans&quot;], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', Retrieved on 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Polish political leaders fled [[Warsaw]] at the onset of war, and those who remained were generally executed, jailed or forced to serve on the [[Jewish Council]] (''Judenrat'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007224 &quot;Jewish Youth Movements in Wartime Poland: From Minority to Leadership&quot;], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', Retrieved on 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the Zionist Youth Movement who fled returned to Warsaw through a sense of responsibility as local leaders, for both youth in general and the wider [[Jewish]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007224 &quot;Jewish Youth Movements in Wartime Poland: From Minority to Leadership&quot;], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', Retrieved on 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100,000 young Jews participated in resistance youth movements, despite the Germans outlawing such activity.&lt;ref&gt;International School for Holocaust Studies.

The Zionist groups' focus changed with the onset of war. Before the war, they focused on social and ideological development. Feeling a higher sense of responsibility to their people during the war, they set out to educate their people by setting up underground schools in ghettos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007224 &quot;Jewish Youth Movements in Wartime Poland: From Minority to Leadership&quot;], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', Retrieved on 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

These leaders led a [[ghetto]] resistance, determining political and social action underground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007224 &quot;Jewish Youth Movements in Wartime Poland: From Minority to Leadership&quot;], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', Retrieved on 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Youth of the Zionist resistance were part of the [[Armee Juive]] (''Jewish Army'') in France, created in 1942, an armed Jewish resistance in Western Europe. They took part in the 1944 uprisings against the Germans in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005441 &quot;Armed Jewish Resistance: Partisans&quot;], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', Retrieved on 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members of the youth movement [[Hashomer Hatzair]] fought in the [[Warsaw Ghetto uprising]] of 1943. The participation of children in this armed resistance is usually regarded as nothing short of heroic.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, David.

==Soviet Union's Red Army==

A number of child soldiers served in the Soviet Union's armed forces during World War II. In some cases, orphans also unofficially joined the Soviet [[Red Army]]. Such children were affectionately known as &quot;son of the regiment&quot; (Russian: сын полка) and sometimes willingly performed military missions such as reconnaissance. Officially, the age of military conscription was lowered to 18 for those without secondary education and 19 for those who had been educated beyond that. .&lt;ref&gt;Simkin, John. [http://spartacus-educational.com/RUSred.htm &quot;The Red Army&quot;], ''Spartacus Educational'', Retrieved on 23 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home Guard (UK)==

In the United Kingdom, boys of 17 were accepted into the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] when it was formed in 1940 in preparation for a German invasion and as a &quot;last line of defence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;IVM Staff. [http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-real-dads-army &quot;The Real Dad’s Army&quot;], ''Imperial War Museum'', Retrieved on 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 1942, the minimum age was lowered to 16 provided there was parental consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staffshomeguard.co.uk/J5GeneralInformatonKeyDates.htm &quot;THE 32ND STAFFORDSHIRE (ALDRIDGE) BATTALION 1940–1944: TIMELINE 1938–1945 – KEY DATES OF THE HOME GUARD&quot;], ''Staffshomeguard.co.uk'', Retrieved on 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; They were nicknamed &quot;[[Dad's Army]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.parkfieldict.co.uk/world-war-ii/the-home-guard &quot;The Home Guard&quot;], ''Children's British Encyclopedia'', Retrieved on 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of State for War, [[Anthony Eden]], called for men between the ages of 17 and 65 for Home Guard duty, so it was voluntarily undertaken by those of the younger age. Initially a rag-tag militia, the Home Guard and its young volunteers became well-equipped and well-trained. More than 1,200 Home Guard men died from German bombings.&lt;ref&gt;IVM Staff.

==Japanese youth military groups==

In anticipation of the possible Allied [[invasion of Japan]], Japanese military authorities also trained young teenagers to fight the enemy with bamboo spears and other (often poorly) improvised weapons. Some Japanese children aged 17 years volunteered to be Kamikaze suicide pilots.&lt;ref&gt;Eigen, Louis D. [http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/child-soldiers-are-unfortunately-nothing-new/ &quot;Child soldiers are unfortunately nothing new&quot;], ''Scriptamus.wordpress.com'', Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to that, Japanese school children experienced increased military training introduced through their physical education classes, with military drills becoming a staple part of their curriculum.

The [[Japanese Imperial Army]] mobilized students aged 14–17 years in [[Okinawa]] island for [[the Battle of Okinawa]]. This mobilization was conducted by the ordinance of the Ministry of Army, not by law. The ordinances mobilized the student for a volunteer soldier for form's sake. However, in reality, the military authorities ordered schools to force almost all students to &quot;volunteer&quot; for soldiers. Sometimes they counterfeited the necessary documents of students. And student soldiers &quot;'''Tekketsu Kinnotai'''&quot; were killed such as in suicide attacks against a tank with bombs and in guerrilla operations.

After losing in [[the Battle of Okinawa]] in June 1945, the Japanese government enacted new laws in preparation for the decisive battles in the main islands. They were the laws that made it possible boys aged 15 or older and girls aged 17 or older to be drafted into the army for actual battles. Those who escape the draft were punished by imprisonment.

The Japanese surrender, however, had forestalled the Allied invasion of the Japanese main islands, and therefore rendered these child soldiers unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Eigen, Louis D. [http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/child-soldiers-are-unfortunately-nothing-new/ &quot;Child soldiers are unfortunately nothing new&quot;], ''Scriptamus.wordpress.com'', Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes since World War II to protect children==

The introduction of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of a Child]] in 1989 was the first time that any formal commitment was entered into that specified, protected and realised the human rights of a child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30229.html &quot;Conventions on the Right of the Child&quot;], ''UNICEF'', Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This Convention sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children.

Lack of definition of 'child' and lack of protecting a child from exploitation in times of war allowed for children to be used as soldiers and in other war related activities in World War II. 
 
Currently, the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) defines a child soldier as &quot;any child – boy or girl – under eighteen years of age, who is part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or armed group in any capacity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/emerg/files/childsoldiers.pdf &quot;Fact sheet: Child Soldiers&quot;], ''UNICEF'', Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This age limit of 18 is relatively new, only introduced in 2002 under the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. Prior to 2002, the 1949 [[Geneva Convention]] and the 1977 Additional Protocols, set 15 as the minimum age to participate in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Eben. [http://www.cfr.org/human-rights/child-soldiers-around-world/p9331 &quot;Child Soldiers Around the World&quot;], ''Council on Foreign Relations'', Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convicting children of World War II crimes==

It is a contentious issue whether children should be able to be prosecuted for committing [[war crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;McCollough, Lauren. [http://www.crimesofwar.org/onnews/News-Khadr.html &quot;The Military Trial of Omar Khadr: Child Soldiers and the Law&quot;], [http://www.crimesofwar.org/about/about.html &quot;Crimes of War Project&quot;], Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the creation of the United Nations in 1945, and subsequent international conventions, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, child rights have been notably asserted and protected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30229.html &quot;Conventions on the Rights of the Child&quot;], ''UNICEF'', Retrieved on 27 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following World War II, children involved in armed conflict were not able to be prosecuted, as the legislative instruments did not exist to do so. Currently, [[international law]] does not prohibit children in being prosecuted for war crimes they committed, although article 37 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child does limit the punishment a child can receive. This includes &quot;neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/crc/files/Rights_overview.pdf &quot;A Summary of the Rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child&quot;], ''UNICEF'', Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) of the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), which was adopted in 1998, and came into force in 2002, &quot;Conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into the national armed forces or using them to participate actively in hostilities&quot; is a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/RomeStatutEng.pdf &quot;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court&quot;], ''International Criminal Court'', Retrieved on 27 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Paris Principles]] and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Forces or armed groups, those children accused of war crimes, should primarily be treated as victims and treated in accordance with international law under [[restorative justice]], rehabilitation that is consistent child protection treaties and principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/IMG/pdf/Paris_Conference_Principles_English_31_January.pdf &quot;The Paris Principles and Guidelines on Children associated with armed forces or armed groups&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some cases from World War II, where children were prosecuted of war crimes for actions undertaken during the war. Two 15-year-old ex-Hitler Youth were convicted of violating laws of war, by being party to a shooting of a [[prisoner of war]]. The youths' age was a mitigating factor in their sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Law-Reports_Vol-11.pdf &quot;Trial of Johannes Oenning &amp; Emil Nix&quot;], ''British Military Court'', Borken, Germany, 21–22 Dec 1945, 11 L REP.

'''World War&amp;nbsp;II''' (often abbreviated to '''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), also known as the '''Second World War''', was a [[World war|global war]] that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved [[World War II by country|the vast majority of the world's nations]]—including all of the [[great power]]s—eventually forming two opposing [[military alliance]]s: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of &quot;[[total war]]&quot;, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including [[the Holocaust]] (in which approximately 11 million people were killed){{sfn|Fitzgerald|2011|p=4}}{{sfn|Hedgepeth|Saidel|2010|p=16}} and the [[strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing of industrial and population centres]] (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War, Violence, and Population: Making the Body Count |author=James A. Tyner |page=49 |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=The Guilford Press; 1 edition |isbn=1-6062-3038-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; it resulted in an estimated [[World War II casualties|50 million to 85 million fatalities]]. These made World War&amp;nbsp;II the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in [[History of the world|human history]].{{sfn|Sommerville|2008|loc=p. 5 (2011 ed.)}}

The [[Empire of Japan]] aimed to dominate [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and was already [[Second Sino-Japanese War|at war]] with the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] in 1937,{{sfn|Barrett|Shyu|2001|p=6}} but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Alan (2007) ''Encyclopedia of World War II, Volume 1''. Infobase Publishing. pp. 659.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], with campaigns including the [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]] campaigns, the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz bombing campaign]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] as well as the long-running [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. In June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|largest land theatre of war in history]], which trapped the major part of the Axis' military forces into a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States]] and [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European territories]] in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific.

The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]], near [[Hawaii]], and Germany was defeated in [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Allied invasion of Italy]] which brought about Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South]] [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.

The war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany]] by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops and the subsequent [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the [[Soviet–Japanese War (1945)|Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan]] and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] on 15 August 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies.

World War&amp;nbsp;II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious [[great power]]s—the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The UN Security Council&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the [[Cold War]], which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers waned, while the [[decolonisation of Asia]] and [[decolonisation of Africa|Africa]] began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post–World War II economic expansion|economic recovery]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From War to Peace: A European Tale|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-lecture_en.html|publisher=Nobel Lecture by the European Union|accessdate=4 January 2014|author=Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council|author2=José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{See also|Timeline of World War II}}
The start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939,{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Anne Sharp (2014) ''Historical Dictionary of World War II: The War against Germany and Italy''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing. pp. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]]; Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. The dates for the beginning of war in the Pacific include the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] on 7 July 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=John|last1=Ferris|first2=Evan|last2=Mawdsley|title=The Cambridge History of the Second World War, Volume I: Fighting the War|location=[[Cambridge]]|language=English|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2015|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Förster|Gessler|2005|p=64}} or even the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] on 19 September 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Ghuhl, Wernar (2007) ''Imperial Japan's World War Two'' Transaction Publishers pg 7, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polmar, Norman; Thomas B. Allen (1991) World War II: America at war, 1941–1945 ISBN 978-0394585307&lt;/ref&gt;

Others follow the British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]], who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and the two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other starting dates sometimes used for World War&amp;nbsp;II include the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Abyssinia]] on 3 October 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ben-Horin|1943|p=169}}; {{Harvnb|Taylor|1979|p=124}}; Yisreelit, Hevrah Mizrahit (1965).

Barron's Educational Series. p. 236 ISBN 0-7641-1973-7.&lt;br /&gt;There is also the viewpoint that both World War&amp;nbsp;I and World War&amp;nbsp;II are part of the same &quot;[[European Civil War]]&quot; or &quot;[[Second Thirty Years War]]&quot;: {{Harvnb|Canfora|2006|p=155}}; {{Harvnb|Prins|2002|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian [[Antony Beevor]] views the beginning of World War II as the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] fought between Japan and the forces of [[Mongolia]] and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=10}}

The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the [[armistice]] of 14 August 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945). A [[Treaty of San Francisco|peace treaty with Japan]] was signed in 1951 to formally tie up any loose ends such as compensation to be paid to Allied prisoners of war who had been victims of atrocities.{{sfn|Masaya|1990|p=4}} [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|A treaty regarding Germany's future]] allowed the [[Germany reunification|reunification of East and West Germany]] to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of German-American Relations » 1989–1994 – Reunification » &quot;Two-plus-Four-Treaty&quot;: Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, September 12, 1990|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm|publisher=usa.usembassy.de|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|Causes of World War II}}

===Europe===
[[World War I]] had radically altered the [[Geopolitics|political]] European map, with the defeat of the [[Central Powers]]—including [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—and the 1917 [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|seizure of power]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]], which eventually led to the founding of the [[Soviet Union]]. Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Romania, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.

To prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, Völkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]

Despite strong [[pacifism|pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&amp;pg=PA76 76–8]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory and all of [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}

The German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled with the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a &quot;[[New Roman Empire]]&quot;.{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10541, Weimar, Aufmarsch der Nationalsozialisten.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Weimar]], October 1930]]

Adolf Hitler, after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually became the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Chancellor of Germany in 1933]]. He abolished democracy, espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].{{sfn|Brody|1999|p=4}} It was at this time that political scientists began to predict that a second Great War might take place.{{sfn|Dawood|Mitra|2012}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco-Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced [[conscription]].{{sfn|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}

Hoping to contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]]; however, in June 1935, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}

Hitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising]] the [[Rhineland]] in March 1936. He encountered little opposition from other European powers.{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome–Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy would join in the following year.

===Asia===
The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in China launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against [[Warlord Era|regional warlords]] and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese communist]] allies.{{sfn|Preston|1998|p=104}} In 1931, an [[Militarism-Socialism in Showa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Japanese Empire]], which had long sought influence in China{{sfn|Myers|Peattie|1987|p=458}} as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|launch an invasion of Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Smith|Steadman|2004|p=28}}

Too weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coogan|1993}}: &quot;Although some Chinese troops in the Northeast managed to retreat south, others were trapped by the advancing Japanese Army and were faced with the choice of resistance in defiance of orders, or surrender. A few commanders submitted, receiving high office in the puppet government, but others took up arms against the invader. The forces they commanded were the first of the volunteer armies.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]], the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a [[Second United Front|united front]] to oppose Japan.{{sfn|Busky|2002|p=10}}

==Pre-war events==

===Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)===
{{Main article|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}

[[File:Soldatietiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Italian soldiers recruited in 1935, on their way to fight the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]]]

The Second Italo–Abyssinian War was a brief [[colonial war]] that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Names of Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]) by the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia''), which was launched from [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia |author1=Andrea L. Stanton |author2=Edward Ramsamy |author3=Peter J. Seybolt |page=308 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war resulted in the [[military occupation]] of Ethiopia and its [[annexation]] into the newly created colony of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI); in addition, it exposed the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated the League's own [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations|Article X]].{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=131–2}} Germany was the only major European nation to support the invasion. Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]].{{sfn|Kitson|2001|p=231}}

===Spanish Civil War (1936–39)===
{{Main article|Spanish Civil War}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|The [[bombing of Guernica]] in 1937, sparked Europe-wide fears that the next war would be based on bombing of cities with very high civilian casualties]]

When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist rebels]], led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. Over 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the [[International Brigades]], also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the USSR used this [[proxy war]] as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The [[bombing of Guernica]] by the German [[Condor Legion]] in April 1937 heightened widespread concerns that the next major war would include extensive [[terror bombing]] attacks on civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2006|pp=258–60}}.&lt;br /&gt;[[Tony Judt]] said that the &quot;communist strategy in Spain turns out to have been a dry run for the seizure of power in Eastern Europe after 1945.&quot; See {{Harvnb|Judt|Snyder|2012|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Budiansky|2004|pp=209–11}}
The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, bargained with both sides during the Second World War, but never concluded any major agreements. He did send [[División Azul|volunteers]] to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] under German command but Spain remained neutral and did not allow either side to use its territory.{{sfn|Payne|2008}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

===Japanese invasion of China (1937)===
{{Main article|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[File:Shanghai1937IJA ruins.jpg|thumb|left|[[Japanese Imperial Army]] soldiers during the [[Battle of Shanghai]], 1937]]

In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Beijing after instigating the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.{{sfn|Eastman|1986|pp=547–51}} The Soviets quickly signed a [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact with China]] to lend [[materiel]] support, effectively ending China's prior [[Sino-German cooperation (1911–1941)|co-operation with Germany]]. [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] deployed his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|best army]] to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]], but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, [[Battle of Nanking|capturing the capital Nanking]] in December 1937.

===Soviet-Japanese border conflicts===

{{Main article|Soviet–Japanese border conflicts}}
In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in [[Manchukuo]] had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Japanese doctrine of [[Hokushin-ron]], which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the devastating Japanese defeat at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkin Gol]] in 1939 and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of [[Nanshin-ron]], promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Goldman, Stuart D. |date=28 August 2012 |title=The Forgotten Soviet-Japanese War of 1939 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |publisher=The Diplomat |url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy Neeno |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War |publisher=MilitaryHistoryOnline.com |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/nomonhan.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European occupations and agreements===

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], again provoking [[Appeasement of Hitler|little response]] from other European powers.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2000|p=144}} Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the [[Sudetenland]], an area of [[Czechoslovakia]] with a predominantly [[ethnic German]] population; and soon Britain and France followed the counsel of British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and conceded this territory to Germany in the [[Munich Agreement]], which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=121–2}} Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to [[First Vienna Award|cede additional territory]] to [[Hungary]] and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's [[Zaolzie]] region.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=157}}

Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish &quot;war-mongers&quot; and in January 1939 [[Plan Z|secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy]] to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia]] and subsequently split it into the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and a pro-German [[client state]], the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]].{{sfn|Davies|2006|loc=pp. 143–4 (2008 ed.)}} Hitler also delivered [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|an ultimatum]] to Lithuania, forcing the concession of the [[Klaipėda Region]].

Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the [[Free City of Danzig]], Britain and France [[Anglo-Polish military alliance#British Guarantee to Poland|guaranteed their support for Polish independence]]; when [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy conquered Albania]] in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to Romania and [[Greece]].{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=330}} Shortly after the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance|Franco]]-British pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the [[Pact of Steel]].{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2001|p=234}} Hitler accused Britain and Poland of trying to &quot;encircle&quot; Germany and renounced the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] and the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]].

In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]],{{sfn|Shore|2003|p=108}} a non-aggression treaty with a secret protocol. The parties gave each other rights to &quot;spheres of influence&quot; (western [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] for Germany; [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|eastern Poland]], Finland, [[Estonia]], Latvia and [[Bessarabia]] for the USSR). It also raised the question of continuing Polish independence.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2001|p=608}} The agreement was crucial to Hitler because it assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I, after it defeated Poland.

The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. In a private meeting with the Italian foreign minister, [[Count Ciano]], Hitler asserted that Poland was a &quot;doubtful neutral&quot; that needed to either yield to his demands or be &quot;liquidated&quot; to prevent it from drawing off German troops in the future &quot;unavoidable&quot; war with the Western democracies. He did not believe Britain or France would intervene in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/1871-ps.asp Minutes of the conference between the Fuehrer and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Count Ciano, in the presence of the Reich Foreign Minister of Obersalzberg on 12 August 1939] in Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression Volume IV

In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only served as a pretext to worsen relations.&lt;ref name=ww2db_com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=162 |title=The Danzig Crisis |website=ww2db.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish [[plenipotentiary]] immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of [[Danzig]], and to allow a [[plebiscite]] in the [[Polish Corridor]] in which the German minority would vote on secession.&lt;ref name=ww2db_com/&gt; The Poles refused to comply with the German demands and on the night of 30–31 August in a violent meeting with the British ambassador [[Neville Henderson]], Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.&lt;ref name=ibiblio1939&gt;{{cite web |title=Major international events of 1939, with explanation |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/1939.html |publisher=Ibiblio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of Poland's armed forces, the Polish resistance established an [[Polish Underground State|Underground State]] and a partisan [[Polish Home Army|Home Army]].{{sfn|Hempel|2005|p=24}} About 100,000 Polish military personnel were [[Romanian Bridgehead|evacuated to Romania]] and the Baltic countries; many of these soldiers later fought against the Germans in other theatres of the war.{{sfn|Zaloga|2002|pp=88–9}} [[Biuro Szyfrów|Poland's Enigma codebreakers]] were also evacuated to France.{{sfn|Budiansky|2001|pp=120–1}}

On 6 October Hitler made a public peace overture to Britain and France, but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union. Chamberlain rejected this on 12 October, saying &quot;Past experience has shown that no reliance can be placed upon the promises of the present German Government.&quot;&lt;ref name=ibiblio1939/&gt; After this rejection Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France,&lt;ref&gt;Nuremberg Documents C-62/GB86, a directive from Hitler in October 1939 which concludes: &quot;The attack [on France] is to be launched this Autumn if conditions are at all possible.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but bad weather forced repeated postponements until the spring of 1940.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1977|pp=39–40}}{{sfn|Bullock|1990|loc=pp. 563–4, 566, 568–9, 574–5 (1983 ed.)}}&lt;ref&gt;Blitzkrieg: From the Rise of Hitler to the Fall of Dunkirk, L Deighton, Jonathan Cape, 1993, p186-7.

Throughout this period, the neutral United States took measures to assist China and the Western Allies. In November 1939, the American [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] was amended to allow [[Cash and carry (World War II)|&quot;cash and carry&quot;]] purchases by the Allies.{{sfn|Overy|Wheatcroft|1999|pp=328–30}} In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the [[United States Navy]] was [[Two-Ocean Navy Act|significantly increased]]. In September, the United States further agreed to a [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement|trade of American destroyers for British bases]].{{sfn|Maingot|1994|p=52}} Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention into the conflict well into 1941.{{sfn|Cantril|1940|p=390}}

Although Roosevelt had promised to keep the United States out of the war, he nevertheless took concrete steps to prepare for war. In December 1940 he accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an &quot;[[Arsenal of Democracy|arsenal of democracy]]&quot; and promoted the passage of [[Lend-Lease]] aid to support the British war effort.{{r|ibiblio_1940}} In January 1941 secret high level staff talks with the British began for the purposes of determining how to defeat Germany should the US enter the war.

At the end of September 1940, the [[Tripartite Pact]] united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the [[Axis Powers]].

Hitler decided that when the weather improved he would take action against Greece to assist the Italians and prevent the British from gaining a foothold in the Balkans, to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to secure his hold on Romanian oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2008|pp=146, 152}}; {{Harvnb|US Army|1986|pp=[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_1.htm 4–6]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E 003743 E.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Afrika Korps]] soldiers, December 1941]]
The Germans soon intervened to assist Italy. Hitler [[Operation Sunflower|sent German forces to Libya]] in February, and by the end of March they had [[Axis desert offensive (1941)|launched an offensive]] which drove back the Commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support Greece.{{sfn|Laurier|2001|pp=7–8}} In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the [[Siege of Tobruk|besieged port of Tobruk]].{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|pp=263–7}} The Commonwealth [[Operation Brevity|attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May]] and [[Operation Battleaxe|again in June]], but failed on both occasions.{{sfn|Macksey|1997|pp=61–3}}

By late March 1941, following [[Bulgaria]]'s signing of the [[Tripartite Pact]], the Germans were in position to intervene in Greece. Plans were changed, however, because of developments in neighbouring [[Yugoslavia]]. The Yugoslav government had signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March, only to be overthrown two days later by a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|British-encouraged coup]]. Hitler viewed the new regime as hostile and immediately decided to eliminate it. On 6 April Germany simultaneously invaded both [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Greece|Greece]], making rapid progress and forcing both nations to surrender within the month. The British were driven from the Balkans after Germany [[Battle of Crete|conquered the Greek island of Crete]] by the end of May.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=229}} &lt;!-- REFERENCE SEEMS VERY NARROW FOR RANGE OF EVENTS COVERED --&gt; Although the Axis victory was swift, bitter partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the [[Axis occupation of Yugoslavia]], which continued until the end of the war.

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in [[Southeast Asia]], the two powers signed the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941.{{sfn|Garver|1988|p=114}} By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=195}}

Hitler believed that Britain's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-3.html 69]}} He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, [[German-Soviet Axis talks|negotiations took place]] to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.

On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]], with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.&lt;ref name=Events1941&gt;{{citation |last1=Klooz |first1=Marle |last2=Wiley |first2=Evelyn |others=Director: Humphrey, Richard A. |year=1944 |title=Events leading up to World War II – Chronological History |series=78th Congress, 2d Session – House Document N. 541 |location=Washington |publisher=US Government Printing Office |at=pp. 267–312 ([http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/1941.html 1941]) |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary targets of this surprise offensive{{sfn|Sella|1978}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} were the [[Baltic region]], Moscow and [[Ukraine]], with the [[Strategic goal (military)|ultimate goal]] of ending the 1941 campaign near the [[A-A line|Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line]], from the [[Caspian sea|Caspian]] to the [[White Sea]]s.

Although the [[Red Army]] was preparing for strategic [[counter-offensive]]s before the war,{{sfn|Roberts|1995}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} ''Barbarossa'' forced the [[Stavka|Soviet supreme command]] to adopt a [[strategic defence]]. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By the middle of August, however, the German [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army High Command]] decided to [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|suspend the offensive]] of a considerably depleted [[Army Group Centre]], and to divert the [[2nd Panzer Group]] to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.{{sfn|Wilt|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} The [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Kiev offensive]] was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made further [[Crimean Campaign|advance into Crimea]] and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the [[First Battle of Kharkov]]) possible.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=114–37}}

The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=9}} prompted Britain to reconsider its [[grand strategy]].{{sfn|Farrell|1993}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement|military alliance against Germany]]{{sfn|Keeble|1990|p=29}} The British and Soviets [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|invaded Iran]] to secure the [[Persian Corridor]] and Iran's [[oil field]]s.{{sfn|Bueno de Mesquita|Smith|Siverson|Morrow|2003|p=425}} In August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the [[Atlantic Charter]].{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=220}}

By October Axis [[operational objective]]s in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of [[siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]]{{sfn|Kleinfeld|1983}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} and [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942)|Sevastopol]] continuing.{{sfn|Jukes|2001|p=113}} A major [[battle of Moscow|offensive against Moscow]] was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|2001|p=26}}: &quot;By 1 November [the Wehrmacht] had lost fully 20% of its committed strength (686,000 men), up to 2/3 of its ½-million motor vehicles, and 65 percent of its tanks.

The ''blitzkrieg'' [[Phase (combat)|phase]] of the war in Europe had ended.{{sfn|Milward|1964}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

By early December, freshly mobilised [[Military reserve force|reserves]]{{sfn|Rotundo|1986}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=26}} This, as well as [[Richard Sorge#Wartime intelligence supplied by the Sorge Ring|intelligence data]] which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]],{{sfn|Garthoff|1969}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} allowed the Soviets to begin a [[Soviet Offensive (1941–1942)|massive counter-offensive]] that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops {{convert|100|-|250|km|mi}} west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|1998|pp=41–2}}; {{Harvnb|Evans|2008|pp=213–4}}, notes that &quot;Zhukov had pushed the Germans back where they had launched Operation Typhoon two months before.&amp;nbsp;... Only Stalin's decision to attack all along the front instead of concentrating his forces in an all-out assault against the retreating German Army Group Centre prevented the disaster from being even worse.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===War breaks out in the Pacific (1941)===

In 1939 the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan; and, beginning with an [[aviation gasoline]] ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure.{{r|ibiblio_1940}} During this time, Japan launched its [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|first attack against Changsha]], a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September.{{sfn|Jowett|Andrew|2002|p=14}} Despite [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|several offensives]] by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and [[Invasion of French Indochina|occupied northern Indochina]].{{sfn|Overy|Wheatcroft|1999|p=289}} Afterwards, the United States [[embargo]]ed iron, steel and mechanical parts against Japan.{{sfn|Morison|2002|p=60}} Other sanctions soon followed.

In August of that year, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]] launched an [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|offensive in Central China]]; in retaliation, Japan instituted [[Three Alls Policy|harsh measures]] in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.{{sfn|Joes|2004|p=224}} Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces [[New Fourth Army incident|culminated in armed clashes in January 1941]], effectively ending their co-operation.{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=320}} In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during [[Battle of Shanggao]].{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|p=30}} In September, Japan attempted to [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|take the city of Changsha]] again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|p=33}}

German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in [[Southeast Asia]]. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan some oil supplies from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Japanese Policy and Strategy 1931 – July 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=45–66 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=201}}{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|2012|p=456}}

Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.&lt;ref name=USAWWIIcp5&gt;{{cite web |title=The decision for War |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=113–27 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the US, Britain, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.&lt;ref name=USAWWIIcp4&gt;{{cite web |title=The Showdown With Japan Aug–Dec 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=63–96 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt reinforced [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946)]] and warned Japan that the US would react to Japanese attacks against any &quot;neighbouring countries&quot;.{{r|USAWWIIcp4}}

Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war, as [[Imperial Japanese Army|IJA]] General [[Hideki Tojo]] became Imperial Japan's Prime Minister on October 17. On 20 November it presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange they promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw their forces from their threatening positions in southern Indochina.{{r|USAWWIIcp5}} The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/congress/app-d.html#363 The United States Replies]. Investigation of the Pearl Harbor attack.&lt;/ref&gt; That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Painter|2012|p=26}}: &quot;The United States cut off oil exports to Japan in the summer of 1941, forcing Japanese leaders to choose between going to war to seize the oil fields of the Netherlands East Indies or giving in to U.S. pressure.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|2007|p=9}}, listing various military and diplomatic developments, observes that &quot;the threat to Japan was not purely economic.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.{{sfn|Lightbody|2004|p=125}}

Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=310}}; {{Harvnb|Dower|1986|p=5}}, calls attention to the fact that &quot;the Allied struggle against Japan exposed the racist underpinnings of the European and American colonial structure. Japan did not invade independent countries in southern Asia. It invaded colonial outposts which the Westerners had dominated for generations, taking absolutely for granted their racial and cultural superiority over their Asian subjects.&quot; Dower goes on to note that, before the horrors of Japanese occupation made themselves felt, many Asians responded favourably to the victories of the Imperial Japanese forces.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.{{sfn|Wood|2007|pp=11–2}} On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous [[Japanese expansion (1941–1942)|offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific]].{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–3}} These included an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor]], [[Military history of the Philippines during World War II|the Philippines]], [[Battle of Malaya|landings in Thailand and Malaya]]{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–3}} and the [[battle of Hong Kong]].

These attacks led the United States, [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Japan (1941)|Britain]], China, Australia and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunn|1998|p=157}}. According to {{Harvnb|May|1955|p=155}}, Churchill stated: &quot;Russian declaration of war on Japan would be greatly to our advantage, provided, but only provided, that Russians are confident that will not impair their Western Front.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States|Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States]] in Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.{{r|Events1941}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Klooz |first1=Marle |last2=Wiley |first2=Evelyn |others=Director: Humphrey, Richard A. |year=1944 |title=Events leading up to World War II – Chronological History |series=78th Congress, 2d Session – House Document N. 541 |location=Washington |publisher=US Government Printing Office |at=p. 310 ([http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/1941.html 1941]) |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axis advance stalls (1942–43)===
[[File:Casablanca-Conference.jpg|thumb|right|Seated at the [[Casablanca Conference]]; US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British PM [[Winston Churchill]], January 1943]]

In January 1942, [[Big Four (World War II)|the Allied Big Four]]{{sfn|Bosworth|Maiolo|2015|pp=313–314}} (the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and China) and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the [[Declaration by United Nations]], thereby affirming the [[Atlantic Charter]],{{sfn|Mingst|Karns|2007|p=22}} and agreeing to not to sign a [[separate peace]] with the Axis powers.

During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate [[grand strategy]] to pursue. All agreed that [[Europe first|defeating Germany]] was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, [[Operation Sledgehammer|large-scale attack]] on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, lead to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The First Full Dress Debate over Strategic Deployment.

At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration by the United Nations, and demanded the [[unconditional surrender]] of their enemies.
The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Casablanca – Beginning of an Era: January 1943 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=18–42 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic2/USA-WD-Strategic2-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Trident Conference – New Patterns: May 1943 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=126–45 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic2/USA-WD-Strategic2-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered [[Japanese capture of Burma|Burma]], [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Netherlands East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Rabaul]], inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=247–267, 345}} Despite stubborn [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|resistance]] by Filipino and US forces, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.{{sfn|Lewis|1953|loc=p. 529 (Table 11)}} On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=71–4}} Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|South China Sea]], [[Battle of the Java Sea|Java Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean]],{{sfn|Grove|1995|p=362}} and [[Bombing of Darwin|bombed the Allied naval base]] at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|victory at Changsha]].{{sfn|Ch'i|1992|p=158}} These easy victories over unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.{{sfn|Perez|1998|p=145}}

In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to [[Operation Mo|capture Port Moresby]] by [[amphibious assault]] and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force centred on two American fleet carriers fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].{{sfn|Maddox|1992|pp=111–2}} Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier [[Doolittle Raid]], was to seize [[Midway Atoll]] and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|occupy the Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska.{{sfn|Salecker|2001|p=186}} In mid-May, Japan started the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] in China, with the goal of  inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases, and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoppa|2011|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=lILltXBTo8oC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=disease+caused+up+to+10,000+casualties&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FeqFVM39EdejyATb8IGACA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=disease%20caused%20up%20to%2010%2C000%20casualties&amp;f=false  Chevrier &amp; Chomiczewski &amp; Garrigue 2004], p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; In early June, Japan put its operations into action but the Americans, having broken [[Japanese naval codes]] in late May, were fully aware of plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive [[Battle of Midway|victory at Midway]] over the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ropp|2000|p=368}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marines rest in the field on Guadalcanal.jpg|right|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theatre]], 1942]]

With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] by an [[Kokoda Track campaign|overland campaign]] in the [[Territory of Papua]].{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=339}} The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern [[Solomon Islands]], primarily [[Guadalcanal]], as a first step towards capturing [[Rabaul]], the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Adrian |year=2003 |title=The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Times to the Present Day |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=1-59228-027-7 |p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, [[Guadalcanal Campaign|the Battle for Guadalcanal]] took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the [[Oro Province|northern part of the island]], where they faced Australian and United States troops in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]].{{sfn|Swain|2001|p=197}} Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and [[Operation Ke|withdrew their troops]].{{sfn|Hane|2001|p=340}} In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, [[First Arakan Offensive|an offensive into the Arakan region]] in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943.{{sfn|Marston|2005|p=111}} The second was the [[Operation Longcloth|insertion of irregular forces]] behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.{{sfn|Brayley|2002|p=9}}

Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=31}} In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|Kerch Peninsula]] and at [[Second Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]],{{sfn|Read|2004|p=764}} and then launched their main [[Case Blue|summer offensive]] against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the [[Baku Oil Fields|oil fields of the Caucasus]] and occupy [[Kuban]] [[steppe]], while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split [[Army Group South]] into two groups: [[Army Group A]] advanced to the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while [[Army Group B]] headed towards the [[Volga River]]. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.{{sfn|Davies|2006|loc=p. 100 (2008 ed.)}}

By mid-November, the Germans had [[Battle of Stalingrad|nearly taken Stalingrad]] in bitter [[urban warfare|street fighting]] when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an [[Operation Uranus|encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad]]{{sfn|Beevor|1998|pp=239–65}} and an assault on the [[Operation Mars|Rzhev salient near Moscow]], though the latter failed disastrously.{{sfn|Black|2003|p=119}} By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender,{{sfn|Beevor|1998|pp=383–91}} and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another [[Third Battle of Kharkov|attack on Kharkov]], creating a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] in their front line around the Russian city of [[Kursk]].{{sfn|Erickson|2001|p=142}}

In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|second attack against El Alamein]]{{sfn|Keegan|1997|p=277}} and, at a high cost, managed to [[Operation Pedestal|deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta]].{{sfn|Smith|2002}} A few months later, the Allies [[Second Battle of El Alamein|commenced an attack of their own]] in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.{{sfn|Thomas|Andrew|1998|p=8}} This attack was followed up shortly after by [[Operation Torch|Anglo-American landings in French North Africa]], which resulted in the region joining the Allies.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=38}} Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the [[Case Anton|occupation of Vichy France]];{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=38}} although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to [[Scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon|scuttle their fleet]] to prevent its capture by German forces.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=38}}{{sfn|Bonner|Bonner|2001|p=24}} The now pincered Axis forces in Africa withdrew into [[Tunisia]], which was [[Tunisia Campaign|conquered by the Allies]] in May 1943.{{sfn|Ross|1997|p=38}}{{sfn|Collier|2003|p=11}}

In early 1943 the British and Americans began the [[Combined Bomber Offensive]], a strategic bombing campaign against Germany.

After the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent to [[Aleutian Islands Campaign#Allied response|eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians]].{{sfn|Thompson|Randall|2008|p=164}} Soon after, the U.S. with support from Australian and New Zealand forces began major operations to [[Operation Cartwheel|isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands]], and to [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=610}} By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives, and additionally [[Operation Hailstone|neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk]] in the [[Caroline Islands]].

In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany [[Battle of Kursk|attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge]].

On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own [[Operation Kutuzov|counter-offensives]], thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=595}} giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2001|p=35}}{{sfn|Healy|1992|p=90}} The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified [[Panther-Wotan line]], but the Soviets broke through it at [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Smolensk]] and by the [[Lower Dnieper Offensive]]s.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|pp=50–5}}

On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies [[Allied invasion of Italy|invaded the Italian mainland]], following [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italy's armistice with the Allies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1990|p=45}}: &quot;On September 3, as Allied forces landed in Italy, Badoglio agreed to a secret armistice in the hope the Allies would land a major force north of Rome and save his government and the king. But when this didn't happen he desperately attempted to call off his bargain with Eisenhower, who cut short the matter on 8 September by announcing news of its existence. The next day the hero of Abyssinia, his king, and a small retinue deserted Rome for the southeast tip of Italy, leaving most of Italy to the Nazis.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Germany responded by disarming Italian forces, seizing military control of Italian areas,{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=362}} and creating a series of defensive lines.{{sfn|Hart|Hart|Hughes|2000|p=151}} German special forces then [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued Mussolini]], who then soon established a new client state in German occupied Italy named the [[Italian Social Republic]],{{sfn|Blinkhorn|2006|p=52}} causing an [[Italian civil war]].

German operations in the Atlantic also suffered.

From November 1943, during the seven-week [[Battle of Changde]], the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor 2012 268_274&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2012|pp=268–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H161&gt;{{Harvnb|Ch'i|1992|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hsu Chang 412-416&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hsu|Chang|1971|pp=412–416, Map 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1944, the Allies launched a [[Battle of Monte Cassino|series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino]] and tried to outflank it with [[Operation Shingle|landings at Anzio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|pp=660–1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of January, a major [[Leningrad Front|Soviet]] [[Siege of Leningrad#Soviet relief of the siege|offensive expelled German forces]] from the [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad region]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz 2002 327_366&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|2002|pp=327–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ending the longest and [[List of battles by casualties#Sieges and urban combat|most lethal siege in history]].

The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, [[Operation U-Go|an operation against British positions in Assam, India]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lightbody 2004 224&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightbody|2004|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] and [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeiler&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeiler|2004|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeiler&quot;/&gt; and Chinese forces that had [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|invaded northern Burma]] in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in [[Myitkyina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2012|pp=555–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Operation Ichi-Go|second Japanese invasion]] of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ch'i|1992|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of [[Henan]] and begun a [[Battle of Changsha (1944)|new attack on Changsha]] in the [[Hunan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coble|2003|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allies close in (1944)===

[[File:Approaching Omaha.jpg|thumb|American troops approaching [[Omaha Beach]], during the [[Invasion of Normandy]] on [[D-Day]], 6 June 1944]]

On 6 June 1944 (known as [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]), after three years of Soviet pressure,&lt;ref name=rees406&gt;{{Harvnb|Rees|2008|pp=406–7}}: &quot;Stalin always believed that Britain and America were delaying the second front so that the Soviet Union would bear the brunt of the war.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the Western Allies [[Invasion of Normandy|invaded northern France]]. After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also [[Operation Dragoon|attacked southern France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg 2005 695&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=695}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These landings were successful, and led to the defeat of the [[Falaise pocket|German Army units]] in France. Paris was [[Liberation of Paris|liberated]] by the [[French Resistance|local resistance]] assisted by the [[Free French Forces]], both led by General [[Charles de Gaulle]], on 25 August&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Badsey|1990|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Western Allies continued to [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|push back German forces]] in western Europe during the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by [[Operation Market Garden|a major airborne operation]] in the Netherlands failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dear|Foot|2001|p=562}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but [[Operation Queen|failed to cross the Rur river]] in a large offensive. In Italy, Allied advance also slowed due to the [[Gothic Line|last major German defensive line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forrest|Evans|Gibbons|2012|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus (&quot;[[Operation Bagration]]&quot;) that destroyed the German [[Army Group Centre]] almost completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga 1996 7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaloga|1996|p=7}}: &quot;It was the most calamitous defeat of all the German armed forces in World War II.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that [[Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive|another Soviet strategic offensive]] forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviet advance prompted [[Armia Krajowa|resistance forces in Poland]] to [[Operation Tempest|initiate several uprisings]] against the German occupation. However, the largest of these [[Warsaw Uprising|in Warsaw]] where German soldiers massacred 200,000 civilians and a [[Slovak National Uprising|national uprising]] in [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovakia]] did not receive Soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berend|1996|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army's [[Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|strategic offensive in eastern Romania]] cut off and destroyed the [[Army Group South Ukraine|considerable German troops there]] and triggered [[King Michael's Coup|a successful coup d'état in Romania]] and [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|in Bulgaria]], followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies.us&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/23.htm|title=Armistice Negotiations and Soviet Occupation|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=14 November 2009|quote=The coup speeded the Red Army's advance, and the Soviet Union later awarded Michael the Order of Victory for his personal courage in overthrowing Antonescu and putting an end to Romania's war against the Allies.

In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups [[Army Group E|E]] and [[Army Group F|F]] in [[Axis occupation of Greece|Greece]], [[Albania under Nazi Germany|Albania]] and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2008 653&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2008|p=653}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, the Communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] under Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], who had led an [[World War II in Yugoslavia|increasingly successful guerrilla campaign]] against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern [[Serbia (1941–1944)|Serbia]], the [[Red Army]], with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of the capital city of Belgrade]] on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a [[Budapest Offensive|massive assault]] against [[Operation Panzerfaust|German-occupied]] Hungary that lasted until [[Battle of Budapest|the fall of Budapest]] in February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiest|Barbier|2002|pp=65–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, [[Continuation War|bitter Finnish resistance]] to the [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|Soviet offensive]] in the [[Karelian Isthmus]] denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a [[Moscow Armistice|Soviet-Finnish armistice]] on relatively mild conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wiktor|first=Christian L|title=Multilateral Treaty Calendar – 1648–1995|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=1998|isbn=90-411-0584-0|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newton|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although Finland was forced to [[Lapland War|fight their former allies]].

By the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the [[Chindwin River]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Marston 2005 120&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Marston|2005|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Chinese captured Myitkyina.

In the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands]], and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Hideki Tojo]], and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces [[Battle of Leyte|invaded the Filipino island of Leyte]]; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], one of the largest naval battles in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|Bewes|1997|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch [[Battle of the Bulge|a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes]] to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at [[Antwerp]] to prompt a political settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;parkerxiii&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2004|pp=xiii–xiv, 6–8, 68–70, 329–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.&lt;ref name=&quot;parkerxiii&quot;/&gt; In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland, [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|pushing from the Vistula to the Oder]] river in Germany, and [[East Prussian Offensive|overran East Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|2001|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February, US, British, and Soviet leaders met for the [[Yalta Conference]].

On 11 July, Allied leaders [[Potsdam Conference|met in Potsdam, Germany]]. They [[Potsdam Agreement|confirmed earlier agreements]] about Germany,&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2006 90&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2006|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of all Japanese forces by Japan, specifically stating that &quot;the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miscamble 2007 201&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miscamble|2007|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this conference, the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|United Kingdom held its general election]], and [[Clement Attlee]] replaced Churchill as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miscamble 2007 203_204&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miscamble|2007|pp=203–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies called for unconditional Japanese surrender in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] of 27 July, but the Japanese government rejected the call. In early August, the USAAF [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. The Allies justified the atomic bombings as a military necessity to avoid [[Operation Downfall|invading the Japanese home islands]] which would cost the lives of between 250,000–500,000 Allied servicemen and millions of Japanese troops and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Defeating Japan: The Joint Chiefs of Staff and Strategy in the Pacific War, 1943–1945 |pages=133–144 |date=October 16, 2012 |author=Charles F.

==Aftermath==
{{Main article|Aftermath of World War II|Consequences of Nazism}}

[[File:Destroyed Warsaw, capital of Poland, January 1945.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Warsaw]] in January 1945, after the [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|deliberate destruction of the city]] by the occupying German forces]]

The Allies established occupation administrations in [[Allied-administered Austria|Austria]] and [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Germany]]. The former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the USSR, accordingly. A [[denazification]] programme in Germany led to the [[Nuremberg trials|prosecution of Nazi war criminals]] and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frei 2002 41_66&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Frei|2002|pp=41–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern territories, [[Silesia]], [[Neumark]] and most of [[Pomerania]] were taken over by Poland, [[East Prussia]] was divided between Poland and the USSR, followed by the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion of the 9 million Germans]] from these provinces, as well as the expulsion of 3 million Germans from the [[Sudetenland]] in Czechoslovakia to Germany. By the 1950s, every fifth West German was a refugee from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the [[Curzon line]], from which [[Polish population transfers (1944–46)|2 million Poles were expelled]];&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; north-east Romania,&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars55&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shirer794&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}.&lt;/ref&gt; parts of eastern Finland,&lt;ref name=&quot;ckpipe&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kennedy-Pipe|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the three [[Baltic states]] were also incorporated into the USSR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wettig 2008 20_21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=20–1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Senn 2007 ?&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Senn|2007|p=?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to maintain peace,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoder 1997 39&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoder|1997|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Allies formed the United Nations, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |title=History of the UN |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=25 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, as a common standard for all member nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waltz 2002&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|2002}}.&lt;br /&gt;The UDHR is viewable here [http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/].&lt;/ref&gt; The great powers that were the victors of the war—the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France—formed the permanent members of the UN's [[Security Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The UN Security Council&quot;/&gt; The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|between]] the [[Republic of China]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its [[successor state]], the [[Russian Federation]], following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

[[File:Ww2_170.jpg|thumb|Defendants at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. The Allied forces held the trials for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, judicial and economic leadership of [[Nazi Germany]].]]
Germany had been ''de facto'' divided, and two independent states, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and the [[German Democratic Republic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Wettig 2008 96_100&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were created within the borders of Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet [[spheres of influence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trachtenberg 1999 33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Trachtenberg|1999|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most eastern and central European countries fell into [[Soviet bloc|the Soviet sphere]], which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[East Germany]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Applebaum 2012&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Applebaum|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Naimark 2010&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Naimark|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; became Soviet [[satellite state]]s. Communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swain 1992&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led [[NATO]] and the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Borstelmann 2005 318&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Borstelmann|2005|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the [[Cold War]], would be accompanied by an unprecedented [[arms race]] and [[proxy war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|Westad|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, the United States led the [[occupation of Japan]] and [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|administrated Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific]], while the Soviets annexed [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg 2005 911&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=911}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korea]], formerly [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]], was [[Division of Korea|divided and occupied]] by the Soviet Union in the [[North Korea|North]] and the US in the [[South Korea|South]] between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stueck|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|right|180px|Post-war Soviet territorial expansion resulted in [[Central Europe]]an border changes, the creation of a [[Eastern Bloc|Communist Bloc]] and start of the [[Cold War]]]]
In China, nationalist and communist forces [[Chinese Civil War|resumed the civil war]] in June 1946.

While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their [[colonial empire]]s, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to [[Decolonization|decolonisation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JMRoberts 1996 589&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1997|p=589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|2007|pp=441–3, 464–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The US emerged much richer than any other nation; it had a [[post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dear|Foot|2001|p=1006}}; {{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|pp=34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and US pursued a policy of [[Industrial plans for Germany|industrial disarmament in Western Germany]] in the years 1945–1948.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balabkins 1964 207&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Balabkins|1964|p=207}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Petrov|1967|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Balabkins 1964 208,209&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Balabkins|1964|pp=208, 209}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery began with the mid-1948 [[Deutsche Mark|currency reform in Western Germany]], and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the [[Marshall Plan]] (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeLong|Eichengreen|1993|pp=190, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Balabkins 1964 212&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Balabkins|1964|p=212}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The post-1948 West German recovery has been called the [[Wirtschaftswunder#West Germany|German economic miracle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1993|pp=29, 30, 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy also experienced an [[Italian economic miracle|economic boom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bull|Newell|2005|pp=20, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Trente Glorieuses|French economy rebounded]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ritchie|1992|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Minford|1993|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and although it received a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country&lt;!--twice as much as Germany for example--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schain|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; continued relative economic decline for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Emadi-Coffin|2002|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded.

===Occupation===

[[File:Palmiry before execution.jpg|thumb|right|Polish civilians wearing blindfolds photographed just before their execution by German soldiers in [[Palmiry massacre|Palmiry forest]], 1940]]
In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|annexed portions of Czechoslovakia]]) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion [[German Reichsmark|reichmarks]] (27.8 billion US Dollars) by the end of the war, this figure does not include the [[Nazi plunder|sizeable plunder]] of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liberman|1996|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milward 1979 138&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2436-03A, Russland, Hinrichtung von Partisanen retouched.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Academy of Sciences]]  reported in 1995 [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|civilian victims in the USSR]] at German hands totalled 13.7 million dead, 20% of the 68 million persons in the occupied USSR]]
In the East, the much hoped for bounties of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet [[scorched earth]] policies denied resources to the German invaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milward 1992 148&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the West, the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policy]] encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the &quot;[[Untermensch|inferior people]]&quot; of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by [[Generalplan Ost|mass executions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barber|Harrison|2006|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Resistance during World War II|resistance groups]] formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or the West&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Christofferson|Christofferson|2006|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; until late 1943.

In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], essentially a Japanese [[hegemony]] which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Radtke|1997|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSWW6_266&quot; /&gt; During Japan's initial conquest it captured {{convert|4000000|oilbbl}} of oil (~5.5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to {{bbl to t|50|mlt=M}}, 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSWW6_266&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rahn|2001|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home fronts and production===
{{Main article|Military production during World War II|Home front during World War II}}

[[File:WorldWarII-GDP-Relations-Allies-Axis-simple.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Allied to Axis GDP ratio]]

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;6Econ3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.&lt;ref name=&quot;6Econ3&quot;/&gt;

Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;6Econ2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the [[labour force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|1991|p=267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Griffith|first=Charles|title=The Quest: Haywood Hansell and American Strategic Bombing in World War II|isbn=1-58566-069-8|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1999|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany's late shift to a [[war economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overy|1994|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|BBSU|1998|p=84}}; {{Harvnb|Lindberg|Todd|2001|p=126}}..&lt;/ref&gt; To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of [[slave labour]]ers;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Unidas|first=Naciones|title=World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration|page=23|publisher=United Nations Pubns|year=2005|isbn=92-1-109147-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|Germany used]] about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name=&quot;compensation&quot;/&gt; while [[Slavery in Japan|Japan used]] more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;zhifen2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;indonesiaww2&quot;/&gt;

===Advances in technology and warfare===
{{Main article|Technology during World War II}}

[[File:Boeing-Whichata B-29 Assembly Line - 1944.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] [[strategic bombers]] on the [[Boeing]] assembly line in [[Wichita, Kansas]], 1944]]

Aircraft were used for [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]], as [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s, and [[close air support|ground-support]], and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included [[airlift]] (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_76&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[strategic bombing]] (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levine|1992|p=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft weaponry]] also advanced, including defences such as [[radar]] and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German [[88 mm gun]]. The use of the [[jet aircraft]] was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klavans|Di Benedetto|Prudom|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Ward|2010|pp=247–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances were made in nearly every aspect of [[naval warfare]], most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, [[Battle of Taranto|actions at Taranto]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_163&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|last2=Chant|first2=Chris|title=Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft|page=7|publisher=Silverdale Books|year=2004|isbn=1-84509-079-9|location=Wigston, Leics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chenoweth|first1=H.

In the Atlantic, [[escort carrier]]s proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the [[Mid-Atlantic gap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sumner|Baker|2001|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardiner|Brown|2004|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bur&amp;Ryd 1995 15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Burcher|Rydill|1995|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[anti-submarine weapon|weaponry]] and tactics, such as [[sonar]] and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII submarine]] and [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bur&amp;Ryd 1995 16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Burcher|Rydill|1995|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the [[Leigh light]], [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]], [[Squid (weapon)|squid]], and [[Mark 24 FIDO Torpedo|homing torpedoes]] proved victorious.

[[Land warfare]] changed from the static front lines of World War&amp;nbsp;I to increased mobility and [[combined arms]]. The [[tank]], which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_125&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor Nevitt|title=The Evolution of Weapons and Warfare|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|isbn=0-7106-0123-9|year=1982|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanks in World War II|advances continued throughout the war]] with increases in speed, armour and firepower.

At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_108&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_125&quot;/&gt; Many means of [[anti-tank warfare|destroying tanks]], including [[Indirect fire|indirect artillery]], [[anti-tank gun]]s (both towed and [[self-propelled gun|self-propelled]]), [[anti-tank mine|mines]], short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were utilised.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_108&quot; /&gt; Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_734&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comp_221&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cowley|Parker|2001|p=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German [[MG34]], and various [[submachine gun]]s which were suited to [[close combat]] in urban and jungle settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comp_221&quot; /&gt; The [[assault rifle]], a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infantry Weapons Of World War 2|url=http://greyfalcon.us/Infantry%20Weapons%20Of%20World%20War%202.htm|publisher=Grey Falcon (Black Sun)|accessdate=14 November 2009|quote=These all-purpose guns were developed and used by the German army in the 2nd half of World War 2 as a result of studies which showed that the ordinary rifle's long range is much longer than needed, since the soldiers almost always fired at enemies closer than half of its effective range.

The '''entertainment industry during World War II''' underwent changes to help aid the cause of the war. The [[entertainment industry]] during this time was often controlled by a country's government. Since the governments believed that a supportive home front was crucial to their countries' victory, they generally sought to keep the civilian spirits high and to depict the war in a positive light. With this motive in mind, governments engaged in the regulation and censorship of the forms of media, as well as the introduction of new methods of informing citizens through these media outlets.

Government censorship of mass media was enforced in much of the world during this time period in fear of threatening the domestic harmony of a nation. Some of the most popular forms of entertainment during [[World War II]] were radio, film, and music. In conjunction with one another, these forms of media kept citizens entertained with a pastime, informed about their country's war efforts, and motivated to contribute to the cause of the war.

==Radio==
In comparison to television, [[radio]] was a much more affordable form of entertainment. Because of this, the radio was the most popular form of entertainment during World War II. Radio stations fueled propaganda and reached a countless number of citizens. Many shows popularized and quickly gained influence in certain countries. Radio broadcasts, like other forms of entertainment at the time, were regulated by the government and were pushed to keep citizens informed about war efforts and to encourage citizens to help the cause. Radio stations, along with other media outlets, were major fuels of [[propaganda]] during World War II.

An example of a popular radio program is Tommy Handley's ''[[It's That Man Again]],'' which continued airing throughout the war in Britain until 1946. Comedian [[Tommy Handley]] utilized his radio broadcasts to keep citizens informed about the war efforts and to keep the spirits of Britain high during this time of hardship. ''It's That Man Again'' garnered substantial influence - up to 40% of the British population listened to this show during World War II. The show’s last broadcast occurred on January 6, 1946, with Handley passing away only three days later. To further demonstrate the show’s influence, two memorial services were held in his honor, with thousands of listeners present at the funeral grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/entertainment_in_britain.htm |title=Entertainment in Britain |publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''It's That Man Again'' was hosted on [[BBC]], a broadcasting service program still widely known in Britain today. Like BBC, other broadcasting companies also attempted to keep civilian spirits high and expressed certain opinions on the war. Hosts of radio programs took sides regarding the war; for example, the [[Voice of Russia]], the government's international radio broadcasting station, expressed the country’s opinions and eventually targeted the United States. Radio programs were broadcast in up to twenty-three different languages, which widened the appeal of these stations.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Rhodes, &quot;Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II&quot;, 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
Though Philo Farnsworth had invented the first working television system in 1927, only few people owned television sets because of its price and scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museum of the City of San Francisco |url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html |title=Inventor Philo Farnsworth (1906-1971) Revolutionizes Television - 1928 |publisher=Sfmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622033654/http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/philo.html |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most citizens did not own televisions, they relied on [[cinemas]] to keep informed and educated. Cinemas of Europe and the United States were mostly regulated by the government. Films made during this time period were more realistic than escapist, in contrast to [[entertainment during the Great Depression]].

Cinemas provided for a good place to watch information films. New films that showed in cinemas were often informative of a country’s war efforts or the progress of the war itself. Furthermore, the government released additional films that were designed to model the desired human behaviors and actions during the war. These government films often suggested methods of coping with the loss of families and homes and to inform the audience to caution the presence of enemy spies.

===Britain===
The [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] was formed on the day that followed the start of war. It was the department of government that managed propaganda and publicity for Britain during World War II. The Ministry of Information recognized the significant influence that the entertainment industry had over the citizens, so they kept their work close to film maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/inf3.htm |title=Research and learning &amp;#124; Exhibitions &amp;#124; The Art of War &amp;#124; Learn about the art |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British war films typically incorporated a suspenseful story of war while infusing the messages that the Ministry wished to deliver into the storyline.

Another popular example of one of these films is the British propaganda film ''[[Miss Grant Goes to the Door]]'', which taught audiences how to recognize German spies, how to hide [[Ordnance Survey]] maps from enemies, and how to be of aid to soldiers and sailors – women were encouraged to knit socks and mittens for sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/100021800 |title=MISS GRANT GOES TO THE DOOR [Main&amp;#93; &amp;#124; Imperial War Museums |publisher=Iwm.org.uk |date= |access-date=December 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612031637/http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/100021800 |archivedate=June 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This film further reminded citizens that ‘’Cromwell’’ was the codeword to signify the invasion of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/80/a5819880.shtml |title=WW2 People's War - Codeword Cromwell |publisher=BBC |date=September 20, 2005 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood (United States)===
Theater attendance was at an all-time high in 1946, proving to be Hollywood’s most profitable year of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moderntimes.com/1946/ |title=1946: Hollywood and the Great Directors |publisher=Moderntimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the United States, the propaganda agency that coordinated actions with the film industry was the [[Office of War Information]]. The agency worked with film makers to record and photograph wartime activities while regulating its content. The agency worked to display the war in a positive light and censored negative content like pictures of soldier insanity and casualty; pictures of American casualties were banned from being published until 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~class/am485_98/lane/media/censor.htm |title=Print and War |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growth of the film industry came the growth of the influence of Hollywood celebrities. Hollywood stars appeared in advertisements and toured the country to encourage citizens to purchase war bonds to support their country in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1682.html |title=U.S. War Bonds |publisher=U-s-history.com |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, documents published by the National Archives leaked to the public regarding the involvement of numerous Hollywood celebrities with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during World War II. Some 750,000 documents reveal that famous American public figures were actually spies for the Office of Strategic Services. These celebrities include celebrity chef [[Julia Child]] and baseball player [[Moe Berg]], who were hired to gather information required by the US military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7562242.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; US celebrities spied during WWII |publisher=BBC News |date=August 14, 2008 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The theme of war took a popular role in the development of pop music. Artists expressed their feelings of hardships during the war. Others sang songs that aimed to lift the spirits of the citizens.

British singer [[Vera Lynn]], or the Forces Sweetheart, sang popular songs such as &quot;[[We'll Meet Again]]&quot; and &quot;[[The White Cliffs of Dover]]&quot;, which restored an optimistic outlook for soldiers and families while uplifting Allied spirits during a time of hardship when Nazi Germany was bombing Britain.

&quot;[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)]]&quot; was a 1941 [[Academy Award]]-winning song by [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], which illustrated memories of the magnificent city of Paris that had been taken over by Germany prior to the song’s release.

[[The Andrews Sisters]]' &quot;[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]&quot; expressed the feelings of a man's draft experience. Many listeners could relate because of the number of people drafted into the war.

=== Government involvement in the music industry ===
Government agencies pushed music producers to record more patriotic and uplifting songs. The Office of War Information especially pushed for this following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in the United States. In her book ''God Bless America'', Kathleen E.R. Smith states that only twenty-seven war-themed songs had reached the top ten charts during the span of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Kathleen E. R. God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

This suggests that these patriotic war-themed songs, pushed by the government, did not sell well. Billboard archives suggest that the public preferred escapist and rather lighthearted songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/archive#/archive |title=Search the Billboard Magazine Archives |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female singers became more prominent by singing songs expressing the war from the woman’s point of view, illustrating feelings of separation and loneliness. Furthermore, as musicians joined the military, larger bands shrunk and often disbanded, creating a trend towards soloists and smaller music groups.

===Musician contributions to the war===
Many musicians contributed to the war effort. Musician [[Glenn Miller]] enlisted in the army to perform in the United States Organization, in which he established the Army Air Force Band. Musician Irving Berlin assisted in the war effort by creating the &quot;This is the Army&quot; musical, which raised millions by playing on Broadway and for the US troops.

===Impact of the war===
Because of the war, approximately 15 million people &quot;crossed county lines&quot; and brought about the spread of different music styles like country music and African-American styles.&lt;ref&gt;Ennis, Philip H. The Seventh Stream: The Emergence of Rock 'n' Roll in American Popular Music. Hanover: Wesleyan University Press, published by University of New England Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the war itself influenced the music industry through its technology. The capture of Germany’s magnetic tape technology became a staple in music production for independent producers. [[Magnetic tape sound recording]] allowed for independent producers to produce high quality sounds without the assistance of major labels.

===Dance===
Changes in music correlated to the evolution of dances. Ballroom dancing gained popularity when people were looking to have a good time. [[The Grafton Ballroom]] in Britain was famed for its architecture and interior at the time.

The evolution of music brought about new sounds such as [[jazz]] and [[swing music]]. These sounds translated to new dances. [[Jitterbug]] dancing grew in popularity. The [[Jive (dance)|Jive]], which was taken to England by American troops, eventually became a dance of the International style of [[Ballroom dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1344 |title=Port Cities: - Entertainment during World War Two - Cinema |publisher=Mersey-gateway.org |date= |accessdate=December 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526011434/http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1344 |archivedate=May 26, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4852">A '''Cigarette Camp''' was one of a number of temporary U.S. Army &quot;[[tent city|tent cities]]&quot; situated principally around the French ports of [[Le Havre]]&lt;ref&gt;103rd Infantry Division: [http://www.103didww2assn.org/Albums_Remember/VOL%20VI/Toohig,%20Michael%20F.pdf Albums] &quot;The major ports had camps for embarkation both ways. They were
called Cigarette Camps from their names. When the ports opened up that is
where they would keep people and then send them to the front. Then when
the war ended that is how they sent people out through the Cigarette Camps.
Famous Cigarette Camps were in Marseilles and Le Havre.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Marseilles]]&lt;ref&gt;Skylighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/special/cigcamps/cigintro.html Cigarette Camps] &quot;And there were additional embarkation camps in Southern France, north of Marseilles, and, of course, Camp Tophat near Antwerp, Belgium.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; following their respective captures in the wake of the Allied [[D-Day]] invasion in June, 1944, and [[Operation Dragoon]] in July, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer and Mitchell, Victory Ships and Tankers: [http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/Private_Frederick_C_Murphy_HAER_Report.pdf HAER Report]. &quot;The ship made crossings in 1946 carrying troops between the
European Theater of Operations, especially Le Havre, France, and New York City, New
York. From Le Havre, the ship often left from the area known as the 'Cigarette
Camps.'”, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  

Le Havre camps were located in what the Army designated the &quot;Red Horse&quot; staging area and named after popular brands, including Camps [[Lucky Strike]], [[Old Gold (cigarette)|Old Gold]], and [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]].&lt;ref name=sky&gt;Skylighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/special/cigcamps/cigintro.html The Cigarette Camps: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Another series of temporary camps set up at the same time in France was named after United States cities, referred to as &quot;'''City Camps'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sklyighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/citycamps/Skylighters.org City Camps]&lt;/ref&gt; A single Cigarette Camp, [[Tophat]], was located in Antwerp, Belgium.

The Cigarette Camps were administered by the [[89th Infantry Division (United States)|89th Infantry Division]], headquartered at [[Bois-Guillaume]], near Rouen.&lt;ref&gt;89th Infantry Division : [http://www.89infdivww2.org/combat/vevj3.htm Cigarette Camps]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of names==
The names of cigarettes and cities were chosen for two reasons: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, and primarily, for security. Referring to the camps without an indication of their geographical location went a long way to ensuring that the enemy would not know precisely where they were. Anybody eavesdropping or listening to radio traffic would think that cigarettes were being discussed or the camp was stateside, especially regarding the city camps. 

Secondly, there was a subtle psychological reason, the premise being that troops heading into battle wouldn't mind staying at a place where cigarettes must be plentiful and troops about to depart for combat would be somehow comforted in places with familiar names of cities back home (Camp Atlanta, Camp Baltimore, Camp New York, and Camp Pittsburgh, among others).&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The camps varied widely in size, from around 2,000 in capacity to nearly 60,000 at the largest of the &quot;Big Three&quot;, Camps Philip Morris, Old Gold, and Lucky Strike.

==French camps==
The nine Cigarette Camps included:
*Camp Home Run, Sanvic — 2,000
*Camp Wings, on the grounds of the Blaville Aerodrome — 2,250
*Camp Pall Mall, at Etretat — 7,700
*Camp Herbert Tareyton, located in the Forest of Montgeon — 16,400
*Camp Twenty Grand, at [[Duclair]] — 20,000
*Camp Philip Morris, [[Gainneville]] — 35,000
*Camp Old Gold, at [[Ourville-en-Caux|Ourville]] — 35,000
*Camp Lucky Strike, located between [[Cany-Barville|Cany]] and [[Saint-Valery]] — 58,000
*Camp Chesterfield — (unknown)

==Belgian camp==
* Camp Tophat was a &quot;Cigarette Camp&quot; located near [[Antwerp]], Belgium, named after a popular American brand.&lt;ref name=top&gt;Skylighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/special/cigcamps/camptophat.html Camp Tophat]&lt;/ref&gt; Exact capacity is unknown, but the single camp fielded &quot;thousands of black 20-man tents&quot;.&lt;ref name=top/&gt;

==Role shift==
By war's end both Cigarette and City camps' roles had shifted from gateways to combat to
staging GI's for repatriation to the States, processing liberated American [[POW]]s, and temporarily confining German POWs.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;

Post-war, many of the camps survived with yet new roles, including housing for [[displaced person]]s at least into the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Skylighters.org: [http://www.skylighters.org/special/cigcamps/cmptareyton.html Camp Herbert Tareyton]. Displaced persons were living in former American Nissen huts in 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''193rd Glider Infantry Regiment''' was an [[airborne forces]] [[infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. They were part of the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]] and fought during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].

==Formation==
The 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment was created during [[World War II]] on 16 December 1942. It was officially formed at [[Camp Mackall]], [[North Carolina]] on 15 April 1943 under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Maurice Stubbs (United States Army officer)|Maurice G. Stubbs]]. The regiment was assigned to the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]] and sailed to [[England]] in 1944 in preparation for fighting on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].

==World War II==
During [[Operation Market Garden]] in September 1944, the 17th Airborne Division was held in reserve, and continued to train at Camp Chisleden in [[England]]. Almost three months later, on 16 December, the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] launched a surprise attack, known as the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and the 17th Airborne Division, including the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment, were finally sent to combat. The 17th Airborne Division was attached to [[General (United States)|General]] [[George S. Patton|George Patton's]] [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]] and ordered to immediately close in at [[Mourmelon-le-Grand|Mourmelon-le-Grand Airfield]]. After taking over the defense of the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse River]] sector from [[Givet]] to [[Verdun]] on 25 December, the 17th Airborne Division moved to [[Neufchâteau, Luxembourg Province|Neufchateau, Belgium]], then marched through the snow to Morhet, relieving the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 28th Infantry Division]] on 3 January 1945 and establishing a Division Command Post.

A howling blizzard with below freezing temperatures greeted the 193rd on the morning of 4 January 1945. Patton had ordered the 17th Airborne Division to seize the town of Flamierge where the [[11th Armored Division (United States)|11th Armored]] and the [[87th Infantry Division (United States)|87th Infantry Divisions]] had encountered brutal resistance from the Germans. Two regiments, the [[513th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|513th Parachute Infantry]] on the right and the [[194th Glider Infantry Regiment (United_States)|194th Glider Infantry]] on the left attacked the town of Flamierge while the 193rd GIR and the [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th Parachute Infantry Regiment]] were held in reserve to counter an anticipated German [[panzer]] [[counterattack]]. In the ensuing days, the 193rd GIR, as well as the rest of the 17th Airborne Division, would gain their baptism of fire that would have tested the mettle of the most experienced airborne units. The fighting was so intense that the area would forever be called &quot;Dead Man's Ridge&quot; because of the high casualty count sustained in order to take the strongly defended German emplacements.

By 11 January the German lines were crumbling and all of the 17th Airborne units regrouped except for the 193rd which drove on with American armored units to seize the town of [[Houffalize]]. On 16 January the 193rd rejoined the rest of the 17th Airborne and relieved the 11th Armored Division in pursuit of the [[9th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|9th Panzer Division]], the [[Panzer Lehr Division]], and the [[26th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th Infantry Division]]. This took the 17th Airborne through Flamizoulle, Gives and on to [[Bertogne]] as the Germans continued retreating toward the [[Siegfried Line]].

Beyond Bertogne, 193rd GIR split into &quot;Task Force Stubbs&quot; and &quot;Task Force Bell&quot; with the combined objective of seizing the town of Compogne and the high ground in its immediate vicinity. Turning east from that area the 193rd along with the 507th PIR led the continuing attack across [[Luxembourg]] to the [[Our (river)|Our River]] on the border of [[Germany]]. The [[5th Parachute Division (Germany)|German 5th Parachute Division]] made a vain attempt to maintain a bridgehead at the Our but the 507th managed to cross into Germany and probe the Siegfried Line.

The 17th Airborne Division was finally relieved by the [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th Armored Division]] and returned to camp at [[Châlons-en-Champagne|Chalons-sur-Marne]] in [[France]] on 11 February 1945. The 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment was disbanded on 1 March 1945 in [[Belgium]] in a reorganization of the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]], of which the 17th Airborne Division formed a part. The [[550th Airborne Infantry Battalion (United States)|550th Airborne Infantry Battalion]] was also disbanded. Both units had suffered heavy casualties during the Ardennes Campaign and the remaining troopers were consolidated into the 3rd Battalion of the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment.

Produced by the Directorate for Army Welfare (DAK) in [[British Raj|India]] from 1944 to 46, '''''Calling Blighty''''' was a series of ten-minute films which featured members of the [[British Armed Forces]] stationed in India and [[Southeast Asia]] speaking a personal message direct to camera. These films were shown back in the UK to a specially invited audience in a cinema in the area from which those featured came.

== Background ==
Poor welfare and especially length of tour duty, crystallised in the phrase &quot;the Forgotten Army&quot;, led the [[War Office]] to investigate the significant issue of morale, which culminated in a tour of [[South East Asia Command]] (SEAC) by the [[Geoffrey FitzClarence, 5th Earl of Munster|Earl of Munster]] and his subsequent report in September 1944, although a Morale Committee had met regularly in the War Office since 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;&gt;Sargent, Paul.  November 1992, &quot;'Keep Smiling. Keep those chins up and God bless': filmed messages home from service personnel in the Far East during the Second World War.&quot; ''Imperial War Museum Review No. 7''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Calling Blighty'' was one of the steps introduced by the War Office to address concerns of low morale within the 14th Army stationed in India and SEAC during the latter stages of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;/&gt;

The series title was probably derived from a [[Pathé News|Pathé Gazette]] newsreel issue of early 1944 featuring soldiers based in Italy and the first DAK ''Calling Blighty'' was issued in April 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;/&gt; The production was based at what was then the Training Film Centre in [[Bombay]], already a film production centre for the making of training films for the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], (and later to become the Combined Kinematograph Services Film Production and Training Centre – CKS), with studio space rented at the Shree Sound Studios.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Adam.  Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12358. Mr Dawson worked both as a director and supervising film editor at the CKS.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Calling Blighty'' was produced in two different formats: one was studio-based and the other shot on location. In the studio a canteen set was built to provide a realistic and relaxing environment and personnel were brought in to deliver their messages. On location the unit had to find the personnel – and they travelled widely, through India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]] – whom they filmed outside, usually with some significant landmark behind them. The format was similar to the canteen set-up, with each person addressing their loved ones with a short message direct to camera.&lt;ref name=&quot;atcheler1991&quot;&gt;Atcheler, Jack. Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12357 Mr Atcheler was a cameraman on the ''Calling Blighty'' location unit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equipment used by both studio and location units was broadly the same; 35mm camera, film and sound equipment. In 1945 the cumbersome separate sound camera was replaced by a sound-on-film camera similar to those used for newsreels. The studio had a permanent complement of staff consisting of Indian as well as British personnel. The location unit usually comprised a director, two cameramen, two sound recordists, two assistants and a welfare officer responsible for making the contacts. At least one of the location units operated as part of the [[Army Kinematograph Service]] (AKS) and had been sent out from the [[UK]] to assist.&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;/&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name=&quot;atcheler1991&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Indian documentary maker NS Thapa was a studio-based cameraman on ''Calling Blighty''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, people from one particular city, town or region were grouped together in order to facilitate screening back in the UK, and while personnel from all three services are featured, they are predominantly from the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;/&gt; The completed negatives were sent by sea to the UK, a journey of about six weeks. On arrival the negative was sent to [[Denham Film Studios|Denham Studios]] near [[Uxbridge]], [[Middlesex]], where a print was made for distribution, although a copy was kept in Bombay as a precaution against the negative being lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becket, Albert.  Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12356. Mr Becket was Production Manager at the CKS from May 1945 until August 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''Calling Blighty'' screening took place at a cinema in the subjects local area and was usually organised by the regional Army Welfare Committee. The names and addresses of those to be invited were sent to the UK along with the films.&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;/&gt;

These films continued to be produced after the [[surrender of Japan]] in August 1945 as many thousands of service personnel were still needed in SEAC; transport and forces were still required for the occupation of Malaya, [[Java]] and the return of thousands of prisoners of war, as well as for the occupation of Japan. Production of ''Calling Blighty'' finally ceased in April 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;/&gt;

It is estimated that only slightly more than 10% of the ''Calling Blighty'' films have survived - some 52 issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;sargent1992&quot;/&gt; It is estimated some 400 issues were produced, the majority of the originals – 47 – are held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] Film Archive. An additional five are held by the [[British Film Institute]] National Film Archive. Copies of all Manchester issues are held by the North West Film Archive at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] who are running a project to trace all family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwfa.mmu.ac.uk/blighty/index.php |title=Messages Home: Lost Films of the British Army |website=North West Film Archive |date=2016 |publisher=Manchester Metropolitan University |access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual copies relating to [[Norwich]] and [[Southampton]] are held by the relevant regional film archives.

===Production and logistics===
The Axis lost, at least partly because the Allies, after the USA's and the Soviet Union's entrance into the war, had greater productive resources, and were able to turn these resources into greater numbers of soldiers and weapons than the Axis. This was further compounded by the comparative lack of equipment standardization among the Axis forces and its failure to use its large territorial (and associated resources) gains in an economy on war footing. For instance Nazi Germany was the only war economy which largely didn't make use of the labour of women.

The '''history of the Jews during World War II''' is almost synonymous with the Jewish persecution and murder of unprecedented scale in modern times in political Europe inclusive of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). The massive scale of [[the Holocaust]] which happened during [[World War II]] heavily affected the [[Jews|Jewish nation]] and world public opinion, which only understood the dimensions of the [[Final Solution]] after the war. The genocide known as HaShoah in Hebrew, aimed at the elimination of the Jewish people on the European continent. It was a broadly organized operation led by [[Nazi Germany]], in which approximately six million Jews were murdered methodically and with horrifying cruelty. During [[the Holocaust in occupied Poland]], more than one million Jews were murdered in gas chambers of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] alone. The murder of the Jews of Europe affected Jewish communities in [[The Holocaust in Albania|Albania]], [[History of the Jews in Austria#The Holocaust in Austria|Austria]], [[The Holocaust in Belarus|Belarus]], [[The Holocaust in Belgium|Belgium]], [[History of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina#The Holocaust|Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]], [[German occupation of the Channel Islands#Repressions|Channel Islands]], [[The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[History of the Jews in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[The Holocaust in Estonia|Estonia]], [[The Holocaust in France|France]], [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933-45|Germany]], [[History of the Jews in Greece#World War II.2C Resistance and the Holocaust|Greece]], [[History of the Jews in Hungary#The Holocaust|Hungary]], [[History of the Jews in Italy#Jews during the Fascist era|Italy]], [[The Holocaust in Latvia|Latvia]], [[The Holocaust in Italian Libya|Libya]], [[The Holocaust in Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[The Holocaust in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia#World War II and the Holocaust|Macedonia]], [[History of the Jews in Moldova#The Holocaust|Moldova]], [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands#The Holocaust|The Netherlands]], [[The Holocaust in Norway|Norway]], [[The Holocaust in Poland|Poland]], [[History of the Jews in Romania#The Holocaust|Romania]], [[The Holocaust in Russia|Russia]], [[The Holocaust in Serbia|Serbia]], [[History of the Jews in Slovakia#The Holocaust|Slovakia]], and [[The Holocaust in Ukraine|Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=LDavi&gt;{{cite book |title=A Holocaust Reader |author=[[Lucy S.

Leading to World War II, nearly all Jewish firms in Nazi Germany had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government as part of the &quot;[[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]&quot; policy inaugurated in 1937. As the [[Polish September Campaign|war started]], [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] of Jews took place originally as part of [[Operation Tannenberg]] [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|against the Polish nation]]. The much larger and methodical mass killings of Jews began with the onset of [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Led by ''[[Einsatzkommando]]s'' and the [[Orpo battalions]], the destruction of European Jews took place with the active participation of [[Schutzmannschaft|local Auxiliary Police]] including [[Belarusian Auxiliary Police|Belarusian]], [[Estonian Auxiliary Police|Estonian]], [[Latvian Auxiliary Police|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions|Lithuanian]], and [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police|Ukrainian]] ''Schutzmannschaften''.&lt;ref name=LDavi/&gt;

Before the onset of war, the first pogrom in Nazi Germany was ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', often called ''[[Pogromnacht]]'', or &quot;night of broken glass,&quot; in which Jewish homes were ransacked in numerous German cities along with 11,000 Jewish shops, towns and villages,&lt;ref name=Gilbert30&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Kristallnacht: Prelude to Destruction''. Harper Collins, 2006, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; as civilians and [[Sturmabteilung|SA stormtroopers]] destroyed buildings with sledgehammers, leaving the streets covered in smashed windows &amp;mdash; the origin of the name &quot;Night of Broken Glass.&quot;  Jews were beaten to death; 30,000 Jewish men were taken to [[concentration camp]]s; and 1,668 [[synagogue]]s ransacked with 267 set on fire. Following [[Operation Barbarossa]] launched on 22 June 1941, in the city of [[Lviv Ghetto|Lviv]] in the occupied territory of the [[General Government]], Ukrainian nationalists [[Lviv pogroms|organized two large pogroms]] in July 1941, in which around 6,000 Jews were murdered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longerich194&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Longerich | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Longerich | title = Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews | year = 2010 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-280436-5 | page = 194 | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=cxYqYIn73SgC&amp;q=Petljura+Days#v=snippet&amp;q=Petljura%20Days&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USHMM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=USHMM |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005171 |title=Lwów |format=Internet Archive |work=[[Holocaust Encyclopedia]] |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=4 March 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103305/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005171 |archivedate=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lithuania, local [[Lithuanian Activist Front|militant groups]] engaged in anti-Jewish pogroms on July 25 and 26, 1941 around [[Kaunas pogrom|Kaunas]] even before the Nazi forces arrived, killing about 3,800 Jews and burning synagogues and Jewish shops.&lt;ref name=MacQueen&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=MacQueen |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0253333598&amp;id=USW9-xQ85FwC&amp;pg=PA9 |editor-first=Zvi |editor-last=Gitelman |title=Bitter Legacy: Confronting the Holocaust in the USSR |chapter=Nazi Policy towards the Jews in the Reichskommissariat Ostland, June–December 1941: From White Terror to Holocaust in Lithuania |isbn=0-253-33359-8 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1998 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the deadliest of these Holocaust-era pogroms was the [[Iași pogrom]] in Romania, in which as many as 14,000 Jews were killed by Romanian citizens, police, and military officials.

By December 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] decided to completely [[Genocide|exterminate]] [[Europe]]an Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;YB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |title=Rethinking the Holocaust |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2000 |page=5 |isbn=0300093004 |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WhvShlTeqesC&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;vq=zurotten&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1942, during the [[Wannsee conference]], several [[Nazism|Nazi]] leaders discussed the details of the &quot;[[final solution|Final Solution of the Jewish question]]&quot; (''Endlösung der Judenfrage''). [[Dr. Josef Bühler]] urged [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to proceed with the &quot;Final Solution&quot; in the [[General Government]]. They began to systematically deport Jewish populations from the ghettos and all occupied territories to the seven camps designated as ''Vernichtungslager,'' or [[extermination camp]]s: [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], Birkenau was the Extermination Camp site [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Chelmno concentration camp|Chelmno]], [[Majdanek]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka II]]. [[Sebastian Haffner]] published the analysis in 1978 that Hitler from December 1941 accepted the failure of his goal to dominate Europe forever on his declaration of war against the [[United States]], but that his withdrawal and apparent calm thereafter was sustained by the achievement of his second goal—the extermination of the Jews.

Even as the German Nazi war machine faltered in the last years of the war, precious military resources such as fuel, transport, munitions, soldiers, and industrial resources were still being heavily diverted away from the war and towards the death camps. By the end of the war, much of the Jewish population of Europe had been killed in the [[Holocaust]]. [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], home of the [[History of the Jews in Poland|largest Jewish community]] in the world before the war, had over 90% of its Jewish population, or about 3,000,000 Jews, murdered by the Nazis. [[Greece]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]], [[Lithuania]], [[Bohemia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Latvia]] each had over 70% of their Jewish population killed.&lt;ref name=LDavi/&gt;

[[Belgium]], [[Romania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]], and [[Estonia]] each lost around half of their Jewish populations, the Soviet Union lost over one third of its Jews, and France and Italy each saw around a quarter of their Jewish populations killed.&lt;ref name=LDavi/&gt;

During the war, Spain became an unlikely haven for several thousand Jews. They were mainly from Western Europe, fleeing deportation to concentration camps from occupied France, but also Sephardic Jews from Eastern Europe, especially in Hungary. Trudy Alexy{{who|date=April 2016}} refers to the &quot;absurdity&quot; and &quot;paradox of refugees fleeing the Nazis' [[Final Solution]] to seek asylum in a country where no Jews had been allowed to live openly as Jews for over four centuries.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Trudy Alexy, ''The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993. ISBN 0-671-77816-1. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jews in the Allied Forces==
[[File:Rosh Hashanah Evening (6158254119).jpg|thumb|Servicemen of the 20th Air Force stationed in Guam during World War II participate in a [[Rosh Hashanah]] service.]]
Approximately 1.5 million Jews served in the regular Allied militaries during [[World War II]].

Approximately 550,000 American Jews served in the various branches of the United States armed services. Roughly 52,000 received U.S. military awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;villager&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_34/roleofamerican.html |title=Ours to Fight For: American Jews in the Second World War |last=Hartwick |first=Sharon |journal=The Villager |date= December 24, 2003 |origyear= Dec 24–30 |volume=73 |issue=34 |accessdate= November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 500,000 served in the [[Red Army]], and more than 160,000 earned citations, with over 150 receiving the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] award. Some 100,000 Jews served in the Polish Army during the German invasion, and thousands served in the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Free Polish Forces]], including about 10,000 in [[Anders' Army]]. Over 60,000 Jews served in the [[British Armed Forces]] (excluding dominion or colonial personnel), including 14,000 in the [[Royal Air Force]] and 15,000 in the [[Royal Navy]]. About 30,000 Jews from [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] also served in the British military.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hebrew Impact on Western Civilization'', Dagobert D.

[[Jewish partisans]] also fought throughout occupied Europe and were organized into groups such as the [[Bielski partisans]], [[United Partisan Organization]] and the [[Parczew partisans]]. Jewish Partisans took part in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], the [[Warsaw uprising]] and many other battles throughout the war.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12920">''Erinnerungskultur'' (from German), or Remembrance Culture, is the interaction of an individual or a [[society]] with their past and [[history]].

== Definition ==

In the strictest sense, Remembrance Culture is all the behavioral configurations and socially approved or acquired [[manners]] of a society or group used to keep parts of the past in their consciousness and thus deliberately make it present. The central theme is not the display of historical and objective knowledge but primarily collective and subjective perceptions of historical connections to the past from a current perspective. One can distinguish between private and public Remembrance Culture as well as their respective regular and event-based elements. The striking thing about a Culture of Remembrance is the fact that collective perceptions shape subjective ones. Social conflicts, relationships and problems influence a Remembrance Culture. In a pronounced Culture of Remembrance, less emphasized elements are likely to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Arnd Krüger: Die sieben Arten in Vergessenheit zu geraten.

Memory Studies. 1, 2008, S. 59–71&lt;/ref&gt; Family albums, [[Genealogy|genealogical research]] or anniversaries with personal or familial significance are examples of private or subjective forms of Remembrance Culture. Works from a Remembrance Culture can officially be designated as [[Cultural artifact|cultural artefacts]] or cultural monuments if there is a long-standing [[public interest]].

== Expression and forms ==

Particularly within the public Culture of Remembrance, expressions can be found in a variety of initiatives and approaches, for example the [[Archive|archiving of information]], its [[scientific]] renovation and finally public [[documentation]] and other media presentation. Apart from these forms which are more linked to the event itself, other crucial forms of Remembrance Culture are [[Memorial|memorial sites]], commemoration days and [[monuments]]. Certain events, like for example the [[Historikerstreit|Historians Dispute]] provide a rather constant discussion platform for it in the short term but there are many intense social discussions surrounding it from different topic areas. They very quickly touch on political interests and for that reason they are also subjected to a potential instrumentalisation through current affairs. Thereby, questions concerning the Culture of Remembrance, thus the perception of it is closely linked with questions regarding authorizing claims to power and that of creating a [[national identity]]. In many cases, this leads to the government ritualization of the Culture of Remembrance and determines a number of [[taboos]] in society. The politicization of Erinerungskultur is above all noticeable in [[regime]] changes, in which the previous understanding of past events is altered under new leadership. An obvious example is the way in which we approach monuments, which commemorate heroes from past regimes in the past. They however are not honoured in the same way following a change in regime.

== Examples  ==
In Germany, Austria and in many other countries, the Culture of Remembrance is essentially a synonym for remembering the [[Holocaust]] and the sacrifices made during [[National Socialism]].

However, a central aspect of the Culture of Remembrance is not only the German experience, but also [[genocides]] that have occurred or are still occurring in other countries - especially when this also still affects disadvantaged minorities. Examples of such genocide are Namibia ([[Scramble for Africa|the Riot of Herero and Nama]]), Armenia and Turkey ([[Armenian Genocide|the Armenian Genocide]]) and Rwanda ([[Rwandan genocide|the Rwandian Genocide]]). There are also examples such as [[Apartheid in South Africa]], the [[Reign of Terror]] of the Red Khmer in Cambodia, the acts of [[Stalin]] in the Soviet Union, [[Chairman Mao|Chairman Mao's regime]] in China or the war crimes committed by the Japanese army in eastern Asia during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. They are still of huge significance with their predominantly strong, ritualized ways of remembrance. Nevertheless, they are in many respects not properly reviewed.

== International cooperation in the field of Erinnerungskultur ==

In Europe, the French-German collaboration regarding remembrance can serve as a template for relations between other countries, such as those between Germany and Poland. These two countries have to come to terms with their shared painful past in order to strengthen current relations. Among other things there is a multifaceted dialogue: there have been many events throughout European history which allow for a comparison of different remembrance cultures.

== Conservation, restoration and reconstruction ==

A recent example of reconstruction can be found at the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]]. Anastylosis is the right term to be used here, as the correct positions of many surviving stones from the old construction were calculated, and these were visibly preserved in the new construction.

A lyricist from Dresden, Durs Grünbein, denotes this attempt of reconstruction with a critical distance by using the title Chimäre Dresden (chimera of Dresden): other cities had also a tragic downfall, however, none of them cultivated the memory of the time before the destruction with so much painful nostalgia, none of them lived so much through the identikit of their former cosmopolitan silhouette. Similar conflicts arose i.e. during the reconstruction of Heidelberger Schloss (which remains undone).

== Current discussion ==
In 2011, during the event &quot;Memorial Mania&quot; &lt;ref&gt;am 9./10. Dezember 2011 in Berlin ([http://www.hkw.de/de/programm/2011/andere2011/veranstaltungen_53180/veranstaltungsdetail_67251.php deutsche Vorankündigung durch das Haus der Kulturen der Welt] und [http://www.americanacademy.de/home/program/past/blog/2011/12/09/memorial_mania/989/detail/ englische Vorankündigung durch die American Academy])&lt;/ref&gt; wurde 2011 über angemessene Zeitpunkte für die Errichtung von Denkmälern und die Gefahr einer Instrumentalisierung von Denkmälern für soziale Durchsetzungskämpfe gesprochen. Der amerikanische Denkmalexperte James Young, der den Begriff Counter-Memorial (Gegen-Denkmal) prägte, um die im Blick auf den Holocaust entstandene Denkmalästhetik zu charakterisieren, stellte das New Yorker [[National September 11 Memorial and Museum|Mahnmal an Ground Zero]] in diese Denkmaltradition. There was a talk about the appropriate moments for the construction of the monuments and the danger of the exploitation of the monuments for social enforcement. An American monument expert James Young, who defined the concept Counter-Memorial in order to characterize the view of the Holocaust-originated monument aesthetics, included the Ground Zero Monument in New York to this tradition.

Other prominent and current conflicts about the culture of remembrance are i.e. the reconstruction of [[Berlin City Palace]] in the place of the [[Palace of the Republic]], [[Dresdner Frauenkirche]] that was restored via [[anastylosis]], and the expansion of Prora (that was planned to be a KdF-Seebad, but was however extended to Stalinist barracks) in Rügen to luxus estate.

== Role in the foundation of national identity ==
Culture of remembrance, a historical sorrow, was only of minor importance in the conflict of the Berliner &quot;Holocaust Monument&quot;. According to Jan-Holger Kirsch, its proper significance consists in &quot;redefining of ‘the national identity’ in the unified Germany&quot;. The monument is considered to be a prominent exhibit of the Berliner Republic, in which the acknowledgements of nation and historical guilt are not seen as contradiction anymore. Thereby, the holocaust can be used as a form of identity politics through which especially Jews are excluded once more.

== Critique of Erinnerungskultur ==

=== Loss of Authenticity Through 'Sacrilisation' ===
The historian [[Erik Franzen|K. Erik Franzen]] comments in an article about [[Dachau]], that the topography of the site has maintained a strong religious focus through the construction of different religious memorials that encourage the guiding principle of Christian reconciliation. &quot;The &quot;authenticity&quot; of the site has virtually disintegrated as part of its contact with the past- if there was even such a thing as an authentic site to begin with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fr-online.de/architektur/kz-gedenkstaette-dachau-auf-dem-weg-der-erinnerung,1473352,2777216.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suggestive Museumisation (&quot;Suggestive Musealisierung&quot;) ===
In her autobiography, ;;[[:de:Weiter leben. Eine Jugend]]'', the literary scholar and holocaust survivor [[Ruth Klüger]] has contested whether Dachau, amongst other examples, is suitable for use as an educational facility and museum. She writes that Dachau is so clean and orderly that it almost feels inviting, as if it were evoking the memory of a former holiday camp rather than of a tortured existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ruth Klüger|Title=weiter leben: Eine Jugend |Publisher=Wallstein Verlag|Year=2012|ISBN=9783835321519|Date=  2012|language=German|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=buNFPoxnvHgC|AccessDate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conversation about the growing memorialisation of memory, she expressed the view that &quot;Pathos and Kitsch&quot; would shift the view of reality and would not do justice to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Helmut Zeller Dachau|Periodical=sueddeutsche.de|Title=Versöhnungskirche Dachau: Das Leben als Zufall |ISSN=0174-4917|language=German|URL=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/dachau/versoehnungskirche-dachau-das-leben-als-zufall-1.2509923|AccessDate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aleida Assmann comments that for Klüger, &quot;museumised places of remembrance&quot; have become &quot;Deckerinnerungen&quot; (&quot;screen memories&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Aleida Assmann|Title=Erinnerungsräume: Formen und Wandlungen des kulturellen Gedächtnisses |Publisher=C.H.Beck|Year=2009|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;333|ISBN=9783406585326|Date=  2009|language=German|URL={{Google books|lvMEixh8F1QC|plainurl=y}}|AccessDate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zitat|&quot;The language of commemoration is ritualised, selective, variegated, standardised, and tends to explicitly transport a particular society to the relevant image of history&quot;. The past becomes decontextualised, uncoupled from political, societal and cultural concepts, and there is even an attempt &quot;to master the past and to render it harmless for future generations&quot;. &quot;Nie wieder!&quot; (&quot;Never again!&quot;) is in this case viewed as a cautionary and illusory solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sigrid Jacobeit: KZ-Gedenkstätten als nationale Erinnerungsorte.Zwischen Ritualisierung und Musealisierung.

=== Templates ===
[[Jan Assmann]] sees it as a &quot;threatening sign&quot; that the culture of remembrance is sometimes reduced to a template, whereby only that which fits the template is seen as valid, and that which doesn't is rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann: ''Das kulturelle Gedächtnis.

===Cairo Conference===
{{Main article|Cairo Conference}}
[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] of China  with Roosevelt and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in 1943.]]
The Cairo Conference held in Cairo, Egypt, outlined the Allied position against Japan during World War II and made decisions about postwar Asia. The meeting was attended by President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin did not attend the conference because his meeting with Chiang could have caused friction between the Soviet Union and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cairo Conference of 1943: Roosevelt, Churchill, Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang|first=Ronald Ian|last=Heiferman|location=[[Jefferson, NC]]|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Three conferences===
{{see also|List of World War II conferences}}
[[File:Tehran Conference, 1943.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stalin (left), Roosevelt and Churchill at Tehran, Nov. 1943]]
Britain, the USSR and the US, were in frequent contact through ambassadors, top generals, foreign ministers and special emissaries such as the American [[Harry Hopkins]]. There were numerous high-level conferences; in total Churchill attended 14 meetings, Roosevelt 12, and Stalin 5. Most visible were the three summit conferences that brought together the three top leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Feis, ''Churchill Roosevelt Stalin: The War They Waged and the Peace They Sought: A Diplomatic History of World War II''  (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hardy McNeill, ''America, Britain and Russia: their co-operation and conflict, 1941–1946'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tehran conference====
{{main article|Tehran Conference}}
The first meeting of the Big Three,  Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill, came at the Tehran Conference in Iran from 28 November to 1 December 1943. It agreed on an invasion of France in 1944 (the &quot;Second front&quot;) and dealt with Turkey, Iran, Yugoslavia and the war against Japan as well as the post-war settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Vojtech Mastny, &quot;Soviet War Aims at the Moscow and Tehran Conferences of 1943,&quot; ''Journal of Modern History'' (1975) 47#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;481–504 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1876003 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yalta  conference====
{{main article|Yalta Conference}}
The Yalta Conference met in the Crimea (Russia) February 4–11, 1945. It focused on postwar plans for European boundaries. The Soviets already controlled Poland. The new boundaries of Poland were especially important, with Stalin seeking control of western Belorussia and western Ukraine. Poland was to gain parts of Germany. Stalin promised free elections in Poland under the auspices of a government he controlled. At Roosevelt's strong urging, Stalin agreed to enter the war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. It was agreed the USSR would be a member of the United Nations Security Council, with a veto, and Ukraine and Belorussia would be UN members, but not the other 12 Soviet republics. Germany was to be divided into three zones of occupation, and France was also to get a zone. In a decision that became highly controversial,  all civilians would be repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser J. Harbutt, ''Yalta 1945: Europe and America at the Crossroads'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Potsdam conference 1945-8.jpg|right|thumb|Clement Attlee, Harry Truman and Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference, circa 28 July – 1 August 1945]]

====Potsdam conference====
{{main article|Potsdam Conference}}
The Potsdam Conference was held July 17-Aug. 2, 1945, at Potsdam, Germany, near Berlin. Stalin met with the new U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] and two British prime ministers in succession—Winston Churchill and [[Clement Attlee]]. It demanded &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; from Japan, and finalized arrangements for Germany to be occupied and controlled by the Allied Control Commission.  The status of other occupied countries was discussed in line with the basic agreements made earlier at Yalta.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Feis, ''Between War and Peace: The Potsdam Conference'' (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dumbarton Oaks Conference===
{{main article|Dumbarton Oaks Conference}}
The Dumbarton Oaks Conference or, more formally, the Washington Conversations on International Peace and Security Organization was an international conference at which the United Nations was formulated and negotiated among international leaders. The conference was held at Dumbarton Oaks from August 21, 1944 to October 7, 1944. At the conference, delegations from the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Republic of China deliberated over proposals for the establishment of an organization to maintain peace and security in the world.

===San Francisco Conference===
{{main article|San Francisco Conference}}
San Francisco Conference was a convention of delegates from 50 [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] that took place from 25 April 1945 to 26 June 1945 in [[San Francisco]], [[United States]]. At this convention, the delegates reviewed and rewrote the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference|Dumbarton Oaks agreements]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/55407.htm The United States and the Founding of the United Nations, August 1941 – October 1945]&lt;/ref&gt; The convention resulted in the creation of the [[United Nations Charter]], which was opened for signature on 26 June.The heads of the delegations of the four sponsoring countries (China, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union) took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/history-united-nations-charter/1945-san-francisco-conference/index.html|title=1945: The San Francisco Conference|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain – United States ==
{{See also|Lend-Lease|Destroyers for Bases Agreement|Manhattan Project}}
Though most Americans favoured Britain in the war, there was widespread opposition to American military intervention in European affairs. President Roosevelt's policy of [[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]] still allowed Britain and France to purchase munitions from the United States and carry them home.

[[File:Prince of Wales-5.jpg|thumb|right|Roosevelt and Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter  in August 1941]]
Churchill, who had long warned against Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the [[German invasion of Norway]] in April 1940. After the fall of France Roosevelt gave Britain all aid short of war. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] of September 1940, gave the United States a ninety-nine-year lease on strategically located bases in the Atlantic in exchange for the Royal Navy receiving fifty old destroyers to use in anti-submarine warfare. Roosevelt also sold (for cash) munitions that were carried away in British ships, including over half a million rifles, 85,000 machine guns, 25,000 automatic rifles, mortars, hundreds of field guns, with supplies of the necessary ammunition.  The British needed these munitions to reequip the soldiers who lost all their arms when Dunkirk was evacuated in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;W.K. Hancock and M. M. Gowing, ''British War Economy'' (1949) p. 227 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-9.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in March 1941, the United States enacted [[Lend-Lease]] sending tanks, warplanes, munitions, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Britain received $31.4 billion out of a total of $50.1 billion of supplies sent to the Allies. In sharp contrast to the First World War, these were not loans and no repayment was involved.&lt;ref&gt;Leo T. Crowley, &quot;Lend Lease&quot; in Walter Yust, ed. ''10 Eventful Years'' (1947)1:520, 2, pp. 858–60. There had been loans before Lend lease was enacted; these were repaid.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arcadia===

The [[Arcadia Conference]] was held in Washington, from December 22, 1941 to January 14, 1942, bringing together the top British and American military leaders in Washington, December 22, 1941, to January 14, 1942.  Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt and their aides had very candid conversations that led to a series of major decisions that shaped the war effort in 1942–1943.  The decision was made to invade North Africa in 1942, to send American bombers to bases in England, and for the British to strengthen their forces in the Pacific.  The Conference established the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]], headquartered in Washington, which approved and finalized all military decisions.  It also created a unified [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] (ABDA) in the Far East; it fared poorly.  Finally the conference drafted the Declaration by the United Nations, which committed the Allies to make no separate peace with the enemy, and to employ full resources until victory.&lt;ref&gt;William Hardy McNeill, ''America, Britain and Russia: Their Cooperation and Conflict 1941–1946'' (1953) pp&amp;nbsp;90–118&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Quebec Conference, 1943]] held in Canada in August 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt and the Combined Chiefs plotted strategy against Germany.  They began planning the invasion of France, codenamed [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]] using a report by the Combined Chiefs. They also discussed an increase of the bombing offensive against facilities Germany was using in France and the Low Countries. They decided to continue the buildup of American forces in Britain prior to an invasion of France. Churchill kept drawing attention to the advantages of operations in the Mediterranean theatre. They agreed to use more force to force Italy out of the war, and to occupy it along with Corsica.  Military cooperation was close and successful.&lt;ref&gt;Charmley. ''Churchill's Grand Alliance: The Anglo-American Special Relationship 1940–57'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical collaboration===
{{Main article|Technology during World War II#Allied cooperation}}
Technical collaboration was even closer, as the two nations shared secrets and weapons regarding the proximity fuze and radar, as well as airplane engines, Nazi codes, and the atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''Engineers of Victory: The Problem Solvers Who Turned The Tide in the Second World War'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James W. Brennan, &quot;The Proximity Fuze: Whose Brainchild?,&quot; ''U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings'' (1968) 94#9 pp. 72–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Septimus H. Paul|title=Nuclear Rivals: Anglo-American Atomic Relations, 1941–1952|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSZpgW-N628C&amp;pg=PA1|year=2000|publisher=Ohio State U.P.|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millions of American servicemen were based in Britain during the war, which led to a certain amount of friction with British men and intermarriage with British women.  This animosity was explored in art and film, most particularly [[A Matter of Life and Death (film)#Anglo-American relations|''A Matter of Life and Death'']] and ''[[A Canterbury Tale#Anglo-American (mis)understandings|A Canterbury Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Reynolds, ''Rich Relations: The American Occupation of Britain, 1942–45'' (Random House, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 Churchill sent a British fleet to help the United States attack and invade Japan.

===Casablanca conference===

{{main article|Casablanca Conference}}
From January 14–24, 1943 Roosevelt, Churchill and the Combined Staff met in [[Casablanca]], Morocco. They decided on the major Allied strategy for 1943 in Europe, especially the invasion of Italy and planning for the invasion of France. At Roosevelt's suggestion they agreed on a policy of &quot;[[Unconditional surrender#World War II|unconditional surrender]].&quot;  This policy uplifted Allied morale, but it also made the Nazis resolve to fight to the bitter end. Roosevelt also tried to establish a working relationship between the two main French allies, Henri Giraud, the French high commissioner in North Africa, and General de Gaulle, leader of the [[Free French]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan F. Wilt, &quot;The Significance of the Casablanca Decisions, January 1943,&quot; ''Journal of Military History'' (1991) 55#4 pp 517–529 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1985768 in JSTOR]

[[File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The heads of government of five members of the Commonwealth of Nations at the 1944 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.]]
Britain's declaration of war against Germany in September 1939 included the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] and [[British Raj|India]], which it directly controlled. The dominions were independent in foreign policy but all of them (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa) soon declared war on Germany. The fears in London that South Africa would take the advice of Prime Minister [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and remain neutral were relieved when the  parliament voted 80 to 67 for war, and Hertzog resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stewart, &quot;The British Government and the South African Neutrality Crisis, 1938–39,&quot; ''English Historical Review'' (2008) 23# 503, pp&amp;nbsp;947–972&lt;/ref&gt;  After the French defeat in June 1940, Britain and its empire stood alone in combat against Germany, until June 1941. The United States gave strong diplomatic, financial and material support, starting in 1940, especially through [[Lend Lease]], which began in 1941, In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and agreed on the [[Atlantic Charter]], which proclaimed &quot;the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live&quot; should be respected. This wording was ambiguous and would be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.

Starting in December 1941, Japan overran British possessions in Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaya, and especially the key base at [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and marched into Burma, headed toward India.  Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the rapid defeats irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power.  The realisation that Britain could not defend them pushed Australia and New Zealand into permanent close ties with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Warren|title=Britain's Greatest Defeat: Singapore 1942|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zosKzAoocu8C&amp;pg=PA295|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Serious tension erupted over American demands that [[India]] be given independence, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the expectation of a large American role in a post-colonial era. However, in 1942 when the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] launched a [[Quit India]] movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and imprisoned them until 1945. Meanwhile, India became the main American staging base for aid to China. Churchill threatened to resign if Roosevelt pushed too hard regarding independence, so Roosevelt backed down.&lt;ref&gt;Eric S. Rubin, &quot;America, Britain, and Swaraj: Anglo-American Relations and Indian Independence, 1939–1945,&quot; ''India Review&quot; (2011) 10#1 pp 40–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi &amp; Churchill: The Epic Rivalry That Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdPmzLtU5G4C|year=2008|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=472–539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain and France===
In spring 1939 both Britain and France formally announced they would defend the integrity of Poland. Hitler did not believe they would fight in such a faraway hopeless cause, and he invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Britain and France declared war on September 3, 1939. But there was little they could or did do to help Poland. When Germany began its attack on France in April 1940, British troops and French troops again fought side by side, but defeat came quickly. The Royal Navy evacuated  198,000 British and 140,000 French soldiers in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] in late May/early June 1940. Tens of thousands of tanks, trucks and artillery guns were left behind, as well as all of the radios, machine guns, rifles, tents, spare parts and other gear. The new Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] pledged that Britain would continue to fight for France's freedom, even if it must do so alone.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II'' (1994) pp&amp;nbsp;130–31, 142–161&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Mers el Kebir]], Britain recognised [[Free France]] as its ally and the legitimate government of France. [[File:Churchill De Gaulle HU 60057.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Prime Minister Churchill and General de Gaulle at [[Marrakesh]], January 1944]]

The United States maintained diplomatic relations with Vichy (until late 1942) and avoided recognition of de Gaulle's claim to be the one and only government of France.  Churchill, caught between the U.S. and de Gaulle, tried to find a compromise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton Viorst 1967&quot;&gt;Milton Viorst, ''Hostile allies: FDR and Charles de Gaulle'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;David G.

===Britain and Soviet Union===

In October 1944 Churchill and his Foreign Minister [[Anthony Eden]] met in Moscow with Stalin and his foreign minister Molotov. They planned who would control what in postwar Eastern Europe. They  agreed to give 90% of the influence in Greece to Britain and 90% in Romania to Russia. Russia gained an 80%/20% division in Bulgaria and Hungary. There was a 50/50 division in Yugoslavia, and no Russian share in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Resis, &quot;The Churchill-Stalin Secret &quot;Percentages&quot; Agreement on the Balkans, Moscow, October 1944,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' (1978) 83#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;368–387 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1862322 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Larres, ''A companion to Europe since 1945'' (2009) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===

====Iraq====
[[File:Legionnaires guards gladiators.jpg|thumb|left|Gloster Gladiators of British RAF refuel in Iraq, 1941]]

Iraq was an independent country in 1939, with a strong British presence, especially in the oil fields. Iraq broke relations with Germany but there was a strong pro-German element. The regime of Regent [['Abd al-Ilah]] was [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|overthrown in 1941]] by the [[Golden Square (Iraq)|Golden Square]]  pro-Nazi army officers, headed by [[Rashid Ali]]. The short living pro-Nazi government was overpowered in May 1941 by British forces in [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] and the Regent returned to power. Iraq was later used as a base for allied attacks on Vichy-French held [[Mandate of Syria]] and support for the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lyman|title=Iraq 1941: The Battles For Basra, Habbaniya, Fallujah and Baghdad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XFOu9NG9pwC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran (Persia) ====
In 1939 the dictator of Iran was [[Rezā Shāh|Shah Reza Pahlevi]], an army officer who took control in a  coup d'état in 1925 and called himself &quot;shah.&quot; He was a modernizer who had little use for traditional religion, but collaborated with the Germans. Iran proclaimed neutrality when the war began in 1939. British and Soviet forces [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupied Iran in August 1941]], deposed the Shah, and installed his son  [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]]. Iran, with a largely rural population of 13 million, had oil wells and became a major route for shipping military supplies from the U.S. to the Soviet Union.

At the [[Tehran Conference of 1943]], Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill issued the [[Tehran Declaration]] that guaranteed the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran. However, when the war actually ended, Soviet troops stationed in northwestern Iran not only refused to withdraw but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states in the northern regions of Azerbaijan and [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the [[Azerbaijan People's Government]] and the [[Republic of Kurdistan]] respectively, in late 1945. Soviet troops did not withdraw from Iran proper until May 1946 after receiving a promise of oil concessions. The Soviet republics in the north were soon [[Iran crisis of 1946|overthrown]] and the oil concessions were revoked.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Hamzavi, &quot;Iran and the Tehran Conference,&quot; ''International Affairs'' (1944) 20#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;192–203 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3018096 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth===
The British dominions joined in the September 3 declaration of war, except for Canada.  In a symbolic statement of autonomous foreign policy, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] delayed Parliament's vote on a declaration of war until September 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip Alfred Buckner|title=Canada and the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmXnLGX7FvEC&amp;pg=PA105|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.P.|pages=105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain generally handled the diplomatic relations of the Commonwealth nations. Canada hosted top level conferences between Britain and the U.S., but did not itself participate in the formal discussions.

Australia, however, felt abandoned by London and moved to a close relationship with the U.S., playing a support role in the American war against Japan.  Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] stated, &quot;I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Morgan|title=Australia: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gz6BI-4jl_oC&amp;pg=PA90|year=2012|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. President Roosevelt ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]], to move the American base from the Philippines to [[Brisbane, Australia]]. By September 1943, more than 120,000 American soldiers were in Australia. The Americans were warmly welcomed but there was some tensions.  MacArthur worked very closely with the Australian government and took command of its combat operations. Fighting continued throughout [[Southeast Asia]] for the next two years. When the European war was declared over, Australia and the US still had a war to win against Japan. MacArthur promoted a policy of &quot;[[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]]&quot; for his American troops while he suggested that the Australian troops should continue clearing and rounding up the Japanese from New Guinea, New Britain, Borneo and Bougainville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Dean|title=Australia 1943: The Liberation of New Guinea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VUCAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=26–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{main article|Franklin D. Roosevelt#Third term, 1941–45}}
President Roosevelt tried to avoid repeating what he saw as Woodrow Wilson's mistakes in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Pastor|title=A Century's Journey: How the Great Powers Shape the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqGJvW-zqocC&amp;pg=PA218|year=1999|publisher=Basic Books|page=218ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He often made exactly the opposite decision. Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China.  Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through [[Lend-lease|Lend-Lease]], with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt always had a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General John J. Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the &quot;[[Europe first]]&quot; strategy.  He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender.  Roosevelt often mentioned his role in the Wilson administration, but added that he had profited more from Wilson's errors than from his successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William E.

===1941-42===
After Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight; The nation was now united on foreign policy. On December&amp;nbsp;11, 1941, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, which responded in kind. Roosevelt and his military advisers implemented a war strategy with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa; launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts; and saving China and defeating Japan. Public opinion, however, gave priority to the destruction of Japan, so American forces were sent chiefly to the Pacific in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-first = David B. | editor1-last = Woolner | editor2-first = Warren F. | editor2-last = Kimball | editor3-first = David | editor3-last = Reynolds | displayeditors=1 | title = FDR's world: war, peace, and legacies | year = 2008 | page = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opening weeks of the war, Japan had conquered the Philippines, and the British and Dutch colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], capturing [[Singapore]] in February&amp;nbsp;1942. Furthermore, Japan cut off the overland supply route to China. The United States flew supplies to China  &quot;over the hump&quot; (The Himalayan Mountains) at enormous cost, until a road could be opened in 1945.

Roosevelt met with Churchill in late December and planned a broad informal alliance among the U.S., Britain, China and the Soviet Union. This included Churchill's initial plan to invade North Africa (called [[Operation Gymnast]]) and the primary plan of the U.S. generals for a western Europe invasion, focused directly on Germany ([[Operation Sledgehammer]]). An agreement was also reached for a centralized command and offensive in the Pacific theater called [[ABDA]] (American, British, Dutch, Australian) to save China and defeat Japan. Nevertheless, the Atlantic First strategy was intact, to Churchill's great satisfaction. On New Year's Day 1942, Churchill and FDR issued the &quot;Declaration by United Nations&quot;, representing 26 countries in opposition to the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom'' (1970) pp 180-85&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==

{{see also|Second Sino-Japanese War|Chiang Kai-shek}}

The United States was a strong supporter of China after Japan invaded in 1937.  Even the isolationists who opposed war in Europe supported a hard-line against Japan. The outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 saw aid flow into the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schaller, ''U.S. Crusade in China, 1938–1945'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

American public sympathy for the Chinese was aroused by reports from missionaries, novelists such as [[Pearl Buck]], and ''[[Time Magazine]]'' of Japanese brutality in China, including reports surrounding the [[Nanking Massacre]], also known as the 'Rape of Nanking'. Japanese-American relations were further soured by the [[Panay incident|USS Panay Incident]] during the bombing of [[Nanjing]]. Roosevelt demanded an apology from the Japanese, which was received, but relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate. By early 1941 the U.S. was preparing to send American planes flown by American pilots under American command, but wearing Chinese uniforms, to fight the Japanese invaders and even to bomb Japanese cities. The &quot;[[Flying Tigers]]&quot; under [[Claire Chennault]] arrived just as the U.S. entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Byrd, ''Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

To augment Chennault's 100 P-40Bs, in May 1941 Washington decided to send 144 Vultee P-48's, 125 P-43's and 66 Lockheed and Douglas medium bombers.  The goal was to give China by early 1942, a respectable air force, judged by Far Eastern standards, sufficient to &quot;(a) protect strategic points, (b) permit local army offensive action, (c) permit the bombing of Japanese air bases and supply dumps in China and Indo-China, and the bombing of coastal and river transport, and (d) permit occasional incendiary bombing of Japan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Romanus and Sunderland. ''Stilwell's Mission to China'' p. 20 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-CBI-Mission/USA-CBI-Mission-1.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A year before the U.S. officially entered the war (after Dec. 7, 1941), Chennault developed an ambitious plan for a sneak attack on Japanese bases. His Flying Tigers would use American bombers and American pilots, all with Chinese markings.  The U.S. military was opposed to his scheme, and kept raising obstacles, but it was adopted by top civilian officials including [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] (the Secretary of the Treasury who financed China) and especially President Roosevelt himself, who made it a high priority to keep China alive.&lt;ref&gt;The official Army history notes that 23 July 1941 FDR &quot;approved a Joint Board paper which recommended that the United States equip, man, and maintain the 500-plane Chinese Air Force proposed by Currie. The paper suggested that this force embark on a vigorous program to be climaxed by the bombing of Japan in November 1941.&quot;  Lauchlin Currie was the White House official dealing with China.

Romanus and Riley Sunderland, '' U.S. Army in World War II: China-Burma-India Theater: Stillwell's Mission to China'' (1953) p. 23 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-CBI-Mission/USA-CBI-Mission-1.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;  By October, 1941, bombers and crews were on their way to China. However the American attack never took place.  The bombers and crews arrived after Pearl Harbor and were used for the war in Burma, for they lacked the range to reach China.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schaller, &quot;American Air Strategy in China, 1939–1941: The Origins of Clandestine Air Warfare,&quot; ''American Quarterly'' (1976) 28#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;3–19 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2712474 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Armstrong, ''Preemptive Strike: The Secret Plan That Would Have Prevented the Attack on Pearl Harbor'' (2006) is a popular version&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romanus and Sunderland.

===Wartime===

After the formal declaration of war in December 1941, the U.S. stepped up the flow of aid, but it had to be routed through India and over the Himalayan Mountains because Japan blocked the other routes. Chiang's beleaguered government was now headquartered in remote [[Chongqing]]. [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kaishek]],&lt;ref&gt;See Laura Tyson Li, ''Madame Chiang Kai-Shek: China's Eternal First Lady'' (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; who had been educated in the United States, addressed the US Congress and toured the country to rally support for China. Congress amended the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and Roosevelt moved to end the [[Unequal Treaties|unequal treaties]]. However, the perception that Chiang's government, with his poorly equipped and ill-fed troops was unable to effectively fight the Japanese or that he preferred to focus more on defeating the Communists grew. [[China Hands]] such as [[Joseph Stilwell]] argued that it was in American interest to establish communication with the Communists to prepare for a land-based counteroffensive invasion of Japan. The [[Dixie Mission]], which began in 1943, was the first official American contact with the Communists. Other Americans, such as [[Claire Chennault]], argued for air power. In 1944, Generalissimo Chiang acceded to Roosevelt's request that an American general take charge of all forces in the area, but demanded that Stilwell be recalled. General [[Albert Wedemeyer]] replaced Stilwell, [[Patrick Hurley]] became ambassador, and Us-China relations became much smoother.

After World War II ended in 1945, the showdown came between the Nationalists and the Communists in a full-scale [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]]. American general [[George C. Marshall]] tried to broker a truce but he failed. The Kuomintang (Nationalist) military position steadily worsened and by 1949, the Communists were victorious and drove the Nationalists from the mainland onto the island of Taiwan.  and other islands. [[Mao Zedong]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in mainland China, while the Republic of China remains in Taiwan to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''Decisive Encounters: The Chinese Civil War, 1946–1950'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==

[[Joseph Stalin#World War II, 1939–1945|Joseph Stalin]] controlled the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]  as his foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Stalin: A Biography'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roberts, ''Molotov: Stalin's Cold Warrior'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Their policy was neutrality until August 1939. The Soviet military had conversations in Moscow with a high level  military delegation from Britain and France. The Soviets demanded an agreement from Poland to allow Soviet troops to enter that country to defend it against Germany, but Poland refused. Those talks went nowhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Erickson|title=The Soviet High Command: a Military-political History, 1918-1941: A Military Political History, 1918-1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvXdi7jZy5YC&amp;pg=PA525|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=525–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, Hitler made friendly proposals to Stalin that led to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop nonaggression pact]] on August 23 that stunned the world. The Soviets achieved friendly relations with Germany in order to carve up Key elements of 
Eastern Europe, especially Poland and the Baltic states.  Following the pact, Germany invaded and quickly defeated Poland; then the Soviets invaded and took control of its preassigned areas of eastern Poland. Both invaders systematically decimated the Polish elite. In the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]], the [[NKVD]] (Soviet secret police) executed  22,000 Polish military and police officers and civilian intelligentsia.&lt;ref&gt;Anna M. Cienciala et al. eds. ''Katyn: A Crime Without Punishment'' (Yale University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years, the USSR supplied Germany with oil and grain. Furthermore, the Kremlin ordered Communist parties around the world to denounce the imperialistic war waged by Britain and France against Germany.  For example, B. Farnborough says, &quot;During the entire period up to the fall of France the British Communist Party functioned as a propaganda agency for Hitler.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;B. Farnborough, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/pearce/1959/04/ww2.htm  &quot;Marxists in the Second World War,&quot; ''Labour Review'', Vol. 4 No. 1, April–May 1959, pp. 25–28]&lt;/ref&gt;

After he ignored repeated warnings, Stalin was stunned when Hitler invaded in June 1941.  Stalin quickly came to terms with Britain and the United States, cemented through a series of summit meetings.  The U.S. and Britain supplied war materials in large quantity through [[Lend Lease]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Munting, &quot;Lend-Lease and the Soviet War Effort,&quot; ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1984) 19#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;495–510 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/260606 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was some coordination of military action, especially in summer 1944. At war's end the central issue was whether Stalin would allow free elections in eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;William Hardy McNeill, ''America, Britain, and Russia: their co-operation and conflict, 1941–1946'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J.

==France==
{{further information|Military history of France during World War II}}

===French Republic===
France and Britain collaborated closely in 1939, and together declared war against Germany two days after it invaded Poland. Apart from the British Dominions (Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa), no independent nation joined their cause. Britain and France took a defensive posture, fearing German air attacks on cities. France hoped the [[Maginot Line]] would protect it from an invasion. There was little fighting between the fall of Poland in mid-September and the following spring; it was the [[Phoney War]] in Britain or ''Drôle de guerre'' – the funny sort of war – in France. Britain tried several peace feelers, but Hitler did not respond.

When Germany had its hands free for an attack in the west, it launched its [[Blitzkrieg]] against Denmark and Norway, easily pushing the British out. Then it invaded the Low Countries and tricked Britain and France into sending its best combat units deep into the Netherlands, where they became trapped in the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940. The Royal Navy rescued over 300,000 British and French soldiers from Dunkirk, but left behind all the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Blatt (ed), The French Defeat of 1940 (Oxford, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vichy France===
{{main article|Foreign relations of Vichy France}}
Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, and the government surrendered in the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]]. Nazi Germany occupied three-fifths of France's territory, leaving the rest in the southeast to the new Vichy government, which was a bit more than a puppet state since it still had a navy.  Germany controlled the entire French economy, and demanded huge reparations in gold and food. However nearly 2 million French soldiers became prisoners of war in Germany. They served as hostages and forced laborers in German factories. The United States suddenly realized Germany was on the verge of controlling practically all of Europe, and it determined to rapidly build up its small Army and Air Force, and expand its Navy. Sympathy with Britain was high, and many were willing to send munitions, but few Americans called for war.

Theoretically [[Vichy France]] it was neutral, but in practice it was largely controlled by Germany until November 1942, when Germany took full control. Vichy was intensely conservative and anti-Communist, but it was practically helpless. Vichy finally collapsed when the Germans fled in summer 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson and Simon Kitson, &quot;The paradoxes of foreign policy in Vichy France,&quot; in Jonathan Adelman, ed., ''Hitler and His Allies in World War Two.'' (Routledge, 2007) pp&amp;nbsp;79–115 [http://www.amazon.com/Hitler-His-Allies-World-War/dp/0415321670/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|Chief [[French State|French]]  collaborationist Marshal Pétain shaking hands with German Führer Hitler at [[Montoire]] on October 24, 1940.]]
The United States granted Vichy full diplomatic recognition, sending Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] to Paris as American ambassador. President Roosevelt hoped to use American influence to encourage those elements in the Vichy government opposed to military collaboration with Germany. Vichy still controlled its overseas colonies and Washington encouraged Vichy to resist German demands such as for air bases in Syria or to move war supplies through French North Africa. The essential American position was that France should take no action not explicitly required by the armistice terms that could adversely affect Allied efforts in the war. When Germany took full control, the U.S. and Canada cut their ties with Vichy.&lt;ref&gt;William Langer, ''Our Vichy gamble'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

====French fleet====
Britain feared that the French naval fleet could end up in German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to maintaining north Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France had been allowed to retain the [[French Navy]], the ''Marine Nationale'', under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never fall into the hands of Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to far away territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. Shortly after France gave up it attacked a large French naval contingent in [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|Mers-el-Kebir]], killing 1,297 French military personnel. Vichy severed diplomatic relations but did not declare war on Britain. Churchill also ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. The French squadron at [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], under Admiral [[René-Emile Godfroy]], was effectively interned until 1943.

The American position towards Vichy France and Free France was inconsistent. President Roosevelt disliked and distrusted de Gaulle, and agreed with Ambassador Leahy's view that he was an &quot;apprentice dictator.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Mayers|title=FDR's Ambassadors and the Diplomacy of Crisis: From the Rise of Hitler to the End of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjLKYL3xbmAC&amp;pg=PA160|year= 2012|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Africa====
Preparing for a landing in North Africa in late 1942, the US looked for a top French ally. It turned to [[Henri Giraud]] shortly before the landing on 8 November 1942, but he had little local support. By hapstance the Vichy leader Admiral [[François Darlan]] was captured and supported the Americans. The Allies, with General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in charge,  signed a deal with Admiral Darlan on 22 November 1942 in which the Allies recognized Darlan as high commissioner for North Africa and West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur L. Funk, &quot;Negotiating the 'Deal with Darlan,'&quot; ''Journal of Contemporary History''  (1973) 8#1 pp&amp;nbsp;81–117 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/259995 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied world was stunned at giving a high command to man who days before had been collaborating with the Nazis; Roosevelt and Churchill supported Eisenhower, for he was following a plan that had been worked out in London and had been approved by Roosevelt and Churchill.  Darlan was assassinated on 24 December 1942, so Washington turned again towards Giraud, who was made High Commissioner of French North and West Africa. Giraud failed to build a political base and was displaced by the last man with any standing, de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Thomas, &quot;The Discarded Leader: General Henri Giraud and the Foundation of the French Committee of National Liberation,&quot; ''French History'' (1996) 10#12 pp&amp;nbsp;86–111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free France===
{{see also|Free French Forces}}
[[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war]]

Free France was the insurgent French government based in London and the overseas French colonies and led by charismatic general [[Charles de Gaulle]]. He was the most senior French military officer to reject the June 1940 surrender (&quot;Armistice&quot;) and oppose the Vichy government of Marshall Pétain. From London on 18 June 1940 he gave an impassioned radio address [[Appeal of 18 June|exhorting the patriotic French people to resist]] [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthon&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allies at War: Allies at War: The Bitter Rivalry among Churchill, Roosevelt, and de Gaulle |last=Berthon|first=Simon|year=2001|publisher=Collins|place=London|isbn=0-00-711622-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He organized the [[Free French Forces]] from soldiers that had escaped with the British at Dunkirk. With British military support the Free French gradually gained control of all French colonies except [[French Indochina|Indochina]], which the Japanese controlled.  The U.S., Britain and Canada wanted Vichy to keep nominal control of the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon|St. Pierre and Miquelon]] for reasons of prestige, but de Gaulle seized them anyway in late 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Thomas, &quot;Deferring to Vichy in the Western Hemisphere: The St. Pierre and Miquelon Affair of 1941,&quot; ''International History Review'' (1997) 19#4 pp&amp;nbsp;809–835.[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.1997.9640805#.UcdqXJyDnsg online]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the British and Americans landed in France in June 1944 de Gaulle headed a government in exile based in London, but he continued to create diplomatic problems for the U.S. and Britain. He refused to allow French soldiers to land on D-Day, and insisted that France be treated as a great power by the other Allies, and that he himself was the only representative of France. Churchill, caught between the U.S. and de Gaulle, tried to find a compromise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton Viorst 1967&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;David G. Haglund 2007&quot;/&gt; The U.S. and Britain allowed de Gaulle the honor of being the first to march into Paris at the head of his army after the Germans had fled.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Lacouture, ''DeGaulle: The Rebel, 1890–1944'' (1990) pp&amp;nbsp;515–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutrals==
The main neutrals were [[Irish neutrality during World War II|Ireland]], Portugal, Spain, [[Sweden during World War II|Sweden]],  Switzerland and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Wylie, ''European Neutrals and Non-Belligerents During the Second World War'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union was officially neutral until June 1941 in Europe, and until August 1945 in Asia, when it attacked Japan in cooperation with the U.S.

===Latin America===
The U.S. believed, falsely, that Germany had a master plan to subvert and take control of the economy of much of South America. Washington made anti-Nazi activity a high priority in the region. Three countries actively joined the war effort, while others passively broke relations or nominally declared war.&lt;ref&gt;Errol D. Jones, ''World War II and Latin America,'' in Loyd Lee, ed. ''World War II in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, with General Sources: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1997) pp&amp;nbsp;415–37&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuba declared war in December 1941 and actively helped in the defense of the Panama Canal.  It did not send forces to Europe. Mexico declared war on Germany in 1942 after u-boats sank Mexican tankers carrying crude oil to the United States. It sent a 300-man [[Escuadrón 201|fighter squadron]] to the war against Japan in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Leonard, and John F. Bratzel, eds. ''Latin America During World War II'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Brazil declared war against Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942 and sent a 25,700-man infantry force that fought mainly on the Italian front, from September 1944 to May 1945. Its Navy and Air Force acted in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank D. McCann]], &quot;Brazil, the United States, and World War II,&quot; ''Diplomatic History'' (1979) 3#1 pp&amp;nbsp;59–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Argentina====
{{main article|Argentina during World War II}}
Argentina hosted a strong, very-well-organized pro-Nazi element before the war that was controlled by German ambassadors. Brazil, Chile and Mexico had smaller movements.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Müller, ''Nationalsozialismus in Lateinamerika: Die Auslandsorganisation der NSDAP in Argentinien, Brasilien, Chile und Mexiko, 1931–1945'' (1997) 567pp.&lt;/ref&gt; American foreign-policy worked to unite all of Latin America in a coalition against Germany.  Argentina proved recalcitrant, and the US worked to undermine the Argentine government. The American policy backfired when the [[1943 Argentine coup d'état|military seized power in a coup in 1943]].  Relationships grew worse to the point that Washington seriously considered economic and diplomatic isolation of Argentina and tried unsuccessfully to keep it out of the United Nations in 1945.  Historians now agree that the supposed affinity between Argentina and Germany was greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Randall B. Woods. Hull and Argentina: Wilsonian Diplomacy in the Age of Roosevelt, Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs (1974) 16#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;350–371 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/174890 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine government remained neutral until the last days of the war but quietly tolerated entry of Nazi leaders fleeing Germany, Belgium and Vichy France in 1945. Indeed, a [[ODESSA|conspiracy theory]] grew up after the war that greatly exaggerated the Nazi numbers and amount of gold they brought.  Historians have shown there was little gold and probably not many Nazis, but the myths live on.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald C. Newton, ''The &quot;Nazi Menace&quot; in Argentina, 1931–1947'' (Stanford U.P., 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stahl, &quot;Odessa und das 'Nazigold' in Südamerika: Mythen und ihre Bedeutungen' [&quot;Odessa and &quot;Nazi Gold&quot; in South America: Myths and Their Meanings&quot;] ''Jahrbuch fuer Geschichte Lateinamerikas'' (2011), Vol. 48, pp&amp;nbsp;333–360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic States===
{{main article|Occupation of the Baltic states}}
Despite declaring neutrality the Baltic states were secretly assigned to the Soviet [[Sphere of influence]] via the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] and subsequently occupied by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. [[Baltic Legations (1940–91)|Diplomatic legations]] continued to represent the Baltic states throughout the period. The United States never recognized control by Germans or USSR.

===Ireland===
{{main article|Irish neutrality during World War II}}
Ireland tried to be strictly neutral during the war, and refused to allow Britain to use bases.  However it had large sales of exports to Britain, and tens of thousands joined the British armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fisk, ''In Time of War: Ireland, Ulster and the Price of Neutrality 1939–1945'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
Portugal was officially neutral, but in practice its dictator [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] collaborated with the British and sold them rubber and tungsten (&quot;wolfram&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;William Gervase Clarence-Smith, &quot;The Portuguese Empire and the 'Battle for Rubber' in the Second World War,&quot; ''Portuguese Studies Review'' (2011), 19#1 pp&amp;nbsp;177–196&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1943 he allowed the Allies to establish air bases in the Azores to fight U-boats. He helped Spain avoid German control. Tungsten was a major product, and he sold to Germany; he stopped in June 1944, when the threat of a German invasion of Portugal was no longer possible.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Wheeler, &quot;The Price of Neutrality: Portugal, the Wolfram Question, and World War II,&quot; ''Luso-Brazilian Review'' (1986) 23#1 pp&amp;nbsp;107–127 and 23#2 pp&amp;nbsp;97–111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Stevens, &quot;World War II Economic Warfare: The United States, Britain, and Portuguese Wolfram.&quot; ''Historian ''61.3 (1999): 539-556.&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked to regain control of East Timor after the Japanese seized it.&lt;ref&gt;Sonny B. Davis, &quot;Salazar, Timor, and Portuguese Neutrality in World War II,&quot; ''Portuguese Studies Review'' (2005) 13#1  pp&amp;nbsp;449–476.&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted several thousand Jewish refugees.  Lisbon maintained air connections with Britain and the U.S. Lisbon was a hotbed of spies and served as the base for the International Red Cross in its distribution of relief supplies to POWs held by Germany. The Quakers and other peace groups used it as a base for their aid to refugees.&lt;ref&gt;William Howard Wriggins, ''Picking up the Pieces from Portugal to Palestine: Quaker Refugee Relief in World War II'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{main article|Spain in World War II}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg|right|thumb|Nazi leaders (from left) [[Karl Wolff]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]]  meet with Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] and his Foreign Minister [[Ramón Serrano Súñer|Serrano Súñer]] in Madrid, October 1940.]]

Nazi leaders spent much of the war attempting to persuade the [[Franco regime]] to enter the war and allow a German army to march on Gibraltar.  The overtures proved futile. Franco was sympathetic but remained emphatically neutral. However, Spain did need to pay off its heavy debt to Germany. Therefore, Franco did provide various kinds of support to Italy and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire, Nazi rule in Occupied Europe'' (2009) pp.&amp;nbsp;114–5, 320&lt;/ref&gt; It sold Germany supplies, especially wolfram, the hard-to-find tungsten ore.  It formed 45,000 volunteers into the [[Blue Division]], which fought exclusively on the Eastern Front.

Spain was neutral and traded as well with the Allies. Germany had an interest in seizing the key fortress of Gibraltar, but Franco stationed his army at the French border to dissuade Germany from occupying the Iberian Peninsula. Franco displayed pragmatism and his determination to act principally in Spanish interests, in the face of Allied economic pressure, Axis military demands, and Spain's geographic isolation.  As the war progressed he became more hard-line toward Germany and more accommodating to the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II'' (2009) [http://www.amazon.com/Franco-Hitler-Spain-Germany-World/dp/0300151225/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{main article|Sweden during World War II}}
[[File:Tiger295.jpg|right|frame|'''[[En svensk tiger]]''', A famous ''World War II'' poster reminding Swedes to be wary of spies asking questions.]]

Sweden remained neutral during the war, avoiding the fate of its neighbors, occupied Norway and defeated Finland. The dominant historiography for decades after the war ignored issues of the [[Holocaust]] and depended on the &quot;small state realist&quot; argument. It held that that neutrality and cooperation with Germany were necessary for survival, for Germany was vastly more powerful, concessions were limited and were only made where the threat was too great; neutrality was bent but not broken; national unity was paramount; and in any case Sweden had the neutral right to trade with Germany. Germany needed Swedish iron and had nothing to gain—and much iron to lose—by an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;John Gilmour, ''Sweden, the Swastika, and Stalin: The Swedish Experience in the Second World War'' (2011) pp&amp;nbsp;270–71 [http://www.questia.com/library/120075612/sweden-the-swastika-and-stalin-the-swedish-experience online]&lt;/ref&gt; The nation was run by a unity government that included all major parties in the Riksdag. Its key leaders included Prime Minister [[Per Albin Hansson]] and Foreign Minister [[Christian Günther]].  [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustav V]] had pro-Nazi proclivities that the government had to keep in check.

===Switzerland===
{{main article|Switzerland during the World Wars}}
Switzerland was neutral and did business with both sides.  It mobilized its army to defend itself against any invasion.  The [[Operation Tannenbaum|Germans did make plans]], but never invaded.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Urner, ''Let's Swallow Switzerland: Hitler's Plans against the Swiss Confederation'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Cut off from the Allies, Swiss trade was mostly with Germany, with Swiss banks a favourite place for Nazis to store their loot. The Swiss depended on German permission to import its food and fuel.  Smuggling high precision tools and weapons (such as jewel bearings, diamond dies, and chronographs) to Britain took place on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Wylie, &quot;British Smuggling Operations from Switzerland, 1940–1944,&quot; ''Historical Journal'' (2005) 48#5 pp. 1077–1102 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4091649 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Switzerland became a convenient center for spies and espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Halbrook, ''Swiss and the Nazis: How the Alpine Republic Survived in the Shadow of the Third Reich'' (2010) ch 12&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Swiss banks paid Germany 1.3 billion Swiss Francs for gold; Germany used the Francs to buy supplies on the world market. However much of the gold was looted and the Allies warned Switzerland during the war. In 1947 Switzerland paid 250 million francs in exchange for the dropping of claims relating to the Swiss role in the gold transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Z. Slany|title=US and Allied Efforts to Recover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen Or Hidden by Germany During World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dRKMeIM6EcC&amp;pg=PA100|year=1997|publisher=DIANE Publishing|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland took in 48,000 refugees during the war, of whom 20,000 were Jewish.  They also turned away about 40,000 applicants for refugee status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Georg Kreis|title=Switzerland and the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe92SCpUBM8C&amp;pg=PT132|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook, ''Swiss and the Nazis''  ch 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland's role regarding Nazi Germany became highly controversial in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, ''Between the Alps and a Hard Place: Switzerland in World War II and the Rewriting of History'', (2013) [http://www.amazon.com/Between-Alps-Hard-Place-ebook/dp/B00BY6TRB2/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wylie says, &quot;Switzerland has been widely condemned for its part in the war. It has been accused of abetting genocide, by refusing to offer sanctuary to Hitler's victims, bankrolling the Nazi war economy, and callously profiting from Hitler's murderous actions by seizing the assets of those who perished in the death camps.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neville Wylie|title=Britain, Switzerland, and the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XoZ75_E3fpMC&amp;pg=PA2|year=2003|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A recent example of the expose literature is Adam LeBor, ''Tower of Basel: The Shadowy History of the Secret Bank that Runs the World'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Churchill told his foreign minister in late 1944:
:&quot;Of all the neutrals, Switzerland has the great right to distinction. She has been the sole international force linking the hideous-sundered nations and ourselves. What does it matter whether she has been able to give us the commercial advantages we desire or has given too many to the German, to keep herself alive? She has been a democratic state, standing for freedom in self defence among her mountains, and in thought, despite of race, largely on our side.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian Leitz|title=Nazi Germany and neutral Europe: during the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=147g760AE9cC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2000|publisher=Manchester U.P,|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
{{main article|History of the Republic of Turkey}}
[[File:Roosevelt Inönü and Churchill in Cairo cph.3b15312.jpg|thumb|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[Ismet Inönü|İnönü]] of Turkey and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] at the Second Cairo Conference which was held between December 4–6, 1943.]]
Turkey was neutral in the war, but signed a treaty with Britain and France in October 1939 that said the Allies would defend Turkey if Germany attacked it. The deal was enhanced with loans of ₤41 million. An invasion was threatened in 1941 but did not happen and Ankara refused German requests to allow troops to cross its borders into Syria or into the USSR. Germany had been its largest trading partner before the war, and Turkey continued to do business with both sides. It purchased arms from both sides. The Allies tried to stop German purchases of chrome (used in making better steel). Starting in 1942 the Allies provided military aid and pressed for a declaration of war. Turkey's president conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in November, 1943, and promised to enter the war when it was fully armed. By August 1944, with Germany nearing defeat, Turkey broke off relations. In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the future United Nations. Meanwhile, relations with Moscow worsened, setting stage for the [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 and the start of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Erik J. Zurcher, ''Turkey: A Modern History'' (3rd ed. 2004) pp&amp;nbsp;203–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Edwards, &quot;The Impact of the War on Turkey,&quot; ''International Affairs'' (1946) 22#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;389–400 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3017044 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axis==
{{main article|Axis powers}}
[[File:Second world war europe animation small.gif|thumb|300px|right|Animation of the European Theatre.]]
The dictators of Germany and Italy, Hitler and Mussolini, had numerous conferences.  Neither ever met with top Japanese leaders. The Japanese ambassador to Germany handled many of the negotiations between Germany and Japan, but his coded messages home were intercepted and decrypted by the United States starting in 1941. The U.S. shared them with Britain. They revealed important German plans.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Boyd, ''Hitler's Japanese Confidant: General Oshima Hiroshi and Magic Intelligence, 1941–1945'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany's foreign policy during the war involved the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies, such as Italy and Hungary, and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as [[Vichy France]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'' (2009) ch 9&lt;/ref&gt;  By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II'' (2005) p 414&lt;/ref&gt;  When a country was no longer dependable, Germany would assume full control, as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Hungary in 1944. Full control allowed the Nazis to achieve their high priority of mass murdering all Jewish population. Although Japan was officially a powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little coordination or cooperation, such as Germany's refusal to share the secret formula for making synthetic oil from coal until late in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernd Martin|title=Japan and Germany in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_jBOpYASMQC&amp;pg=PA280|year=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=279–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10460, Adolf Hitler, Rednerposen.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hitler in action&lt;/center&gt;]]
DiNardo argues that in Europe Germany's foreign-policy was dysfunctional during the war, as Hitler treated each ally separately, and refused to create any sort of combined staff that would synchronize policies, armaments, and strategies.  Italy, Finland, Romania, and Hungary each dealt with Berlin separately, and never coordinated their activities. Germany was reluctant to share its powerful weapons systems, or to train Axis officers. There were some exceptions, such as the close collaboration between the German and Italian forces in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. DiNardo, &quot;The dysfunctional coalition: The axis powers and the eastern front in World War II,&quot; ''Journal of Military History'' (1996) 60#4 pp&amp;nbsp;711–730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. DiNardo, ''Germany and the Axis Powers: From Coalition to Collapse'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hitler====
[[Hitler]] devoted most of his attention during the war to military and diplomatic affairs.  He frequently met with foreign leaders, such as the January 10, 1943 he met with Rumanian Premier Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] at German field headquarters, with top-ranking generals on both sides. On 9 August 1943, Hitler summoned Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria]] to a stormy meeting at field headquarters, and demanded he declare war on Russia. The tsar refused, but did agree to declare war on far-away Britain. American news reports stated that Hitler tried to hit him and the tsar suffered a heart attack at the meeting; he died three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts on File World News Digest'' (August 31, 1943)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forced labour====
{{main article|Forced labour under German rule during World War II}}
German policy was not to use or build factories in occupied Eastern Europe but to move millions of workers into German factories and farms.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'' (2008) ch 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Some were forced, some were voluntarily (going in search of food), others were prisoners of war.  They were closely watched, had poor food and housing, and were harshly treated. Their morale and levels of output were mediocre or poor.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Herbert, ''Hitler's Foreign Workers: Enforced Foreign Labour in Germany Under the Third Reich'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak the forced labourers comprised 20% of the German work force. Counting deaths and turnover, about 15 million individuals were forced labourers at one point or another during the war. Most came from Poland, Russia and other Eastern areas; all were repatriated at war's end.&lt;ref&gt;Panikos Panayi, &quot;Exploitation, Criminality, Resistance. The Everyday Life of Foreign Workers and Prisoners of War in the German Town of Osnabrück, 1939–49,&quot; ''Journal of Contemporary History''  (2005) 40#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;483–502 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/30036339 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Tooze]], ''The Wages of Destruction'' (2007)  pp. 476–85, 538–49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vichy France was one of the few countries that was able to have much influence on German policies, as it tried to protect the nearly two million French soldiers held as POWs inside Germany. Vichy arranged a deal whereby Germany would release one POW for every three Frenchmen who volunteered to work in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Curtis|title=Verdict on Vichy: Power and Prejudice in the Vichy France Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_1YIAcVKqkC&amp;pg=PT141|year=2002|publisher=Skyhorse|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
In January 1934 Germany signed a non aggression pact with Poland followed by a trade treaty later in the year. By the spring Hitler was openly pondering what inducements he might have to offer to obtain a military alliance with Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, T. (2011). ''Bloodlands, Europe between Hitler and Stalin, Vintage'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; 
Between 1919 and 1939 Poland pursued a policy of balance between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and obtained non-aggression treaties with the former.&lt;ref&gt;Anna M. Cienciala, &quot;The Foreign Policy of Józef Pi£sudski and Józef Beck, 1926–1939: Misconceptions and Interpretations,&quot; ''The Polish Review'' (2011) 56#1 pp&amp;nbsp;111–151 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/41549951 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1939 Hitler wanted Poland to join the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] as a satellite state in preparation for the German invasion of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs, ''The Last European War: September 1939 - December 1941'' p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner states that Hitler &quot;wanted to broker an agreement with Colonel Beck, Poland's all-powerful foreign minister, which would bring Danzig and the Polish Corridor back into the Reich but keep Poland as a friend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zara Steiner|title=The Triumph of the Dark:European International History 1933–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKOhFJFPI54C&amp;pg=PR6-IA26|year= 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=690–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler offered Poland a new non-aggression pact and recognition of its current frontiers if it agreed to permit the German-inhabited city of Danzig to return to Germany as well as allow an extraterritorial highway connecting Germany proper with Danzig and East Prussia going through Polish territory. Poland rejected the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Halik Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War'' (2012) pp.&amp;nbsp;34–93&lt;/ref&gt; For Poland these demands meant losing independence; Danzig in itself was not the primary issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerhard L. Weinberg|title=A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlsrAxuWekQC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2005|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March Hitler had given up on the Poles and in April began planning an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Kershaw|title=Hitler, 1936–1945: Nemesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5fJYMxufVcC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2001|publisher=W W Norton |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland had few friends in the international arena.&lt;ref&gt;Zara Steiner, ''The Triumph of the Dark: European International History, 1933–1939'' (2011) pp&amp;nbsp;690–92, 738-41&lt;/ref&gt;  Two critical developments caught Poland by surprise.  At the end of March 1939 Britain and France announced that if Germany invaded Poland they would declare war. In terms of helping Poland militarily in an actual war, everyone realized very little could be done because the British and French military thought that if Germany invaded &quot;Polish resistance would collapse in the early stages of fighting.&quot; Neither &quot;was thinking of any major offensive action in the West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Cameron Watt|title=How war came: the immediate origins of the Second World War, 1938–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-tmAAAAMAAJ|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their hope was that the threat of a two-front war would deter Germany. Hitler believed that Britain and France were bluffing, but he handled the Soviet problem in late August, by an alliance agreement with Stalin, which included secret provisions to partition Poland—and indeed divide up much of eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Road to War: the Origins of World War II'' (1989) pp&amp;nbsp;1–20&lt;/ref&gt;  The British and French offer was not a bluff—they did indeed declare war on Germany when it invaded Poland on 1 September, but neither was in a position to provide serious help.

Poland had a million-man army, but fell far short in terms of leadership, training, and equipment. The Polish military budget was about 2% of Germany's; its commanding general, Marshal Smigly-Rydz was not well prepared for the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed'' (2012) p 52&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet [[Red Army]] then [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] without a formal declaration of war on 17 September 1939, immediately after the undeclared war between the Soviet Union and the [[Empire of Japan]] at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] (Nomonhan) in the Far East had ended. Poland was then partitioned between Germany and the Soviet Union.

====Worldwide Fascist groups====
During the war, Nazi Germany cultivated relationships with Fascist and extreme right groups in neutral and Allied-controlled territory such as the [[Ossewabrandwag]], an Afrikaner paramilitary organisation based on the Nazi Party.

===Italy===

Allied policy was to be friendly with [[Benito Mussolini]], the Fascist dictator of Italy, in the hopes he would either remain neutral or moderate Hitler's expansion plans.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Morgan, ''The Fall of Mussolini: Italy, the Italians, and the Second World War'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in May 1939, he joined the Axis with Germany, signing the [[Pact of Steel]]. When France was in the last stages of collapse Mussolini entered the war and gained some spoils. He brought along a powerful navy that could challenge the British for control of the Mediterranean.  Roosevelt denounced the move: &quot;On this 10th day of June, 1940, the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Langer and Gleason, ''Challenge to Isolation,'' 1:460-66, 502-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy was poorly prepared for war and increasingly fell under Nazi dictation.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor Knox, ''Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Italian military efforts failed against Egypt, Greece, Ethiopia and Yugoslavia,&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn, ''Empire on the Adriatic: Mussolini's Conquest of Yugoslavia, 1941–1943'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany had to intervene to rescue its neighbor. After the Allies invaded and took Sicily and southern Italy in 1943, the regime collapsed. Mussolini was arrested and the King appointed General [[Pietro Badoglio]] as new Prime Minister. They [[Armistice of Cassibile|switched sides]], joined the Allies and banned the Fascist Party.  However Germany moved in, occupying  Italy north of Naples. German paratroopers rescued Mussolini and Hitler set him up as head of a puppet government the [[Italian Social Republic]], often called the Salò Republic; a [[Italian Civil War|civil war resulted]].  The Germans gave way slowly, for mountainous Italy offered many defensive opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith, ''Modern Italy: A Political History'' (1997) [http://www.questia.com/read/7696309?title=Italy%3a%20A%20Modern%20History online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain by 1944 feared that Italy would become a Communist state under Soviet influence. It abandoned its original concept of British hegemony in Italy and substituted for it a policy of support for an independent Italy with a high degree of American influence.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gat, &quot;The Soviet Factor in British Policy towards Italy, 1943–1945,&quot; ''Historian'' (1988) 50#4 pp&amp;nbsp;535–557&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balkans===
{{main article|Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Yugoslavia#World War II|Hungary#World War II 1941–1945}}
Hitler, preparing to invade the Soviet Union, diverted attention to make sure the southern or Balkan flank was secure.  Rumania was under heavy pressure, and was forced to cede 40,000 square miles of territory with 4 million people to the USSR, Hungary and Bulgaria; German troops came in to protect the vital oil fields (Germany's only source of oil besides the USSR). Romania signed the Axis Pact and became a German ally (November 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Deletant, ''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and his Regime, Romania, 1940–1944'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  So too did Hungary (November 1940) and Bulgaria (March, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Held, ed.

====Greece====

{{main article|History of Greece#World War II|Military history of Greece during World War II|Greek Resistance|Battle of Greece}}

In spring 1939, [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy had occupied and annexed Albania]]. Britain tried to deter an invasion by guaranteeing Greece's frontiers. Greece under the dictatorship of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] to support the allies' interests[[Ohi Day|rejected Italian demands]]. Italy invaded Greece on 28 October 1940, but Greeks repelled the invaders after a bitter struggle (see [[Greco-Italian War]]). By mid-December, 1940, the Greeks occupied nearly a quarter of Albania, tying down 530,000 Italian troops. Metaxas tended to favor Germany but after he died in January 1941 Greece accepted British troops and supplies.  In March 1941, a major Italian counterattack failed, humiliating Italian military pretensions.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Sadkovich, &quot;The Italo-Greek War in Context: Italian Priorities and Axis Diplomacy,&quot; ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1993) 28#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;439–464 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/260641  in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany needed to secure its strategic southern flank in preparation for an invasion of the USSR, Hitler reluctantly launched the [[Battle of Greece]] in April 1941. Axis troops successfully invaded through Yugoslavia, quickly overcoming Greek and, British defenders. Greece was partitioned under German, Italian, and Bulgarian occupation. A Greek government-in-exile was formed in Cairo (it moved to London), and Germany set up a puppet government in Athens. The latter attracted numerous anti-Communist elements.

Wartime conditions were severe for civilians; famine was rampant as grain production plunged and Germany seized food supplies for its own needs. Malaria became epidemic. The Germans retaliated brutally for sabotage by the [[Greek Resistance]]. Multiple resistance groups organized, but they often opposed each other. They included the [[National Republican Greek League]] (EDES), the [[National and Social Liberation]]  (EKKA). Strongest of all was the Communist [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM); its military arm, the National Popular Liberation Army (ELAS) had 50,000 soldiers. The rivalries set the stage for a civil war after the Germans left in September 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, ''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yugoslavia====
Yugoslavia signed on as a German ally in March 1941, but within hours an anti-Nazi coup, led by Serbians with British help, overthrew the prince regent, repudiated the Nazis, and installed the 17-year-old heir as [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]]. Germany marched in and set off an extremely bloody, long civil war that killed over a million people.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pavlowitch, ''Hitler's New Disorder: The Second World War in Yugoslavia'' (2008) [http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-New-Disorder-Yugoslavia-Columbia/dp/0231700504/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Mussolini and Pavelic 1941.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Croatia's dictator [[Ante Pavelić]] (left) with Mussolini in 1941; Croatia was a new Axis state]]

The [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) was heavily Catholic and conservative. It became an Axis ally ruled by the fascist militia known as the [[Ustaše]]; it controlled Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ethnic cleansing was its policy. The Ustaše murdered around 500,000 people (mostly Serbs, along with 37,000 Jews), expelled 250,000, and forced another 200,000 to convert to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205930.pdf |title=Croatia |publisher=Shoah Resource Center – [[Yad Vashem]] |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kosovo was given to Albania (then under Italian control). Macedonia went to Bulgaria and Vojvodina was given over to Hungary. Serbia became a German puppet state and was the cockpit of the resistance.

Yugoslavia had a weak government in exile based in London that included the king. However, power inside the country was divided three ways between the Germans and their allies, and two Serbian resistance groups. The royalist anti-Communist [[Chetniks]] under [[Draža Mihailović]], was nominally under the control of the government in exile. Chetniks were opposed to the Nazis but sometimes did collaborate with the Germans and Ustaša in their fierce guerrilla battles with the [[National Liberation Army (Yugoslavia)|National Liberation Army]], a Communist-controlled resistance headed by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Tito's strength grew in 1943, and Mihailović and the monarchists fell far behind. Churchill reversed course in December 1943, ended his support for the royalist forces of Mihailović, and backed instead Tito.&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill, ''Closing the Ring'' (vol. 5 of ''The Second World War'') (1952) ch 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Tito drove out the Germans in 1945 and liquidated the Mihailovic forces. This allowed the formation of a Communist state of Yugoslavia that was independent of Moscow. Historians believe that Germany's large-scale intervention in the Balkans in spring 1941 probably delayed its invasion of Russia long enough to give the Soviets a chance to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Presseisen, &quot;Prelude to 'Barbarossa': Germany and the Balkans, 1940–1941,&quot; (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan had conquered all of Manchuria and most of China by 1939 in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], but the Allies refused to recognize the conquests. Japan joined the Axis with Germany, but shared little information.  Japan depended on imports from the Allies for 90% of its oil, and the cutoff of oil shipments in mid-1941 left Japan with supplies for only a year or two of serious combat by its warships and warplanes unless it came to terms regarding China, or seized oil fields controlled by Britain and the Netherlands. The latter course meant war, and was urged by army officials who had been bloodied in [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|border conflicts]] and were reluctant to engage the Soviets. Some admirals and many civilians, including Prime Minister [[Konoe Fumimaro]], believed that a war with the U.S. would end in defeat. The alternative was loss of honor and power. Diplomats proposed political compromises in the form of the &quot;Amau Doctrine&quot;, dubbed the &quot;Japanese [[Monroe Doctrine]]&quot; which would have given the Japanese free rein with regard to  China. These proposals were rejected by the U.S.; the Japanese Army now demanded a military solution.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Borg, ''The United States and the Far Eastern crisis of 1933–1938'' (1964) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haruo Tohmatsu and H. P. Willmott, ''A Gathering Darkness: The Coming of War to the Far East and the Pacific'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imperial conquests====
[[File:Japanese Empire (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|300px|The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in 1942.]]
Japan launched its own blitzkriegs in East Asia. In 1937, the Japanese Army invaded and captured most of the coastal Chinese cities such as Shanghai. Japan took over [[French Indochina]] (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia), [[British Malaya]] (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore) as well as the [[Dutch East Indies]] (Indonesia). [[Thailand]] managed to stay independent by becoming a satellite state of Japan. In December 1941 to May 1942, Japan sank major elements of the American, British and Dutch fleets, captured [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Lindsay, ''The Battle for Hong Kong, 1941–1945: Hostage to Fortune'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and reached the borders of India and began bombing Australia. Japan suddenly had achieved its goal of ruling the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].

====Imperial rule====
[[File:Manchukuo011.jpg|thumb|200px|1935 poster of the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] promoting harmony among peoples. The caption reads: &quot;With the help of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, the world can be in peace.&quot;]]
The ideology of Japan's colonial empire, as it expanded dramatically during the war, contained two contradictory impulses.  On the one hand, it preached the unity of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], a coalition of Asian races, directed by Japan, against the imperialism of Britain, France, the Netherlands, United States, and Europe in general.  This approach celebrated the spiritual values of the East in opposition to the crass materialism of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Davidann, &quot;Citadels of Civilization: U.S. and Japanese Visions of World Order in the Interwar Period,&quot; in Richard Jensen, et al. eds., ''Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century'' (2003) pp&amp;nbsp;21–43&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it was a euphemistic title for grabbing land and acquiring essential natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Spector]], ''Eagle Against the Sun: The American War With Japan'' (1985) pp 42, 62-64&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese installed organizationally-minded bureaucrats and engineers to run their new empire, and they believed in ideals of efficiency, modernization, and engineering solutions to social problems.  It was [[fascism]] based on technology, and rejected Western norms of democracy.  After 1945, the engineers and bureaucrats took over, and turned the wartime techno-fascism into entrepreneurial management skills.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Moore, ''Constructing East Asia: Technology, Ideology, and Empire in Japan's Wartime Era, 1931–1945'' (2013) pp&amp;nbsp;226–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan set up puppet regimes in Manchuria (&quot;[[Manchukuo]]&quot;) and China; proper; they vanished at the end of the war. The Japanese Army operated ruthless governments in most of the conquered areas, but paid more favorable attention to the Dutch East Indies. The main goal was to obtain oil, but Japan sponsored an Indonesian nationalist movement under [[Sukarno]].&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Sluimers, &quot;The Japanese military and Indonesian independence,&quot; ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'' (1996) 27#1 pp&amp;nbsp;19–36&lt;/ref&gt;  Sukarno finally came to power in the late 1940s after several years of battling the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hering, ''Soekarno: Founding Father of Indonesia, 1901–1945'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch destroyed their oil wells but the Japanese reopened them. However most of the tankers taking oil to Japan were sunk by American submarines, so Japan's oil shortage became increasing acute.

====Puppet states in China====

[[File:Showa Steel Works.JPG|thumb|Shōwa Steel Works was a mainstay of the [[Economy of Manchukuo]]]]

Manchuria, the historic homeland of the Manchu dynasty, had an ambiguous character after 1912.  It was run by local warlords.  The Japanese Army seized control in 1931, and set up a puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932 for the 34,000,000 inhabitants.  Other areas were added, and over 800,000 Japanese moved in as administrators.  The nominal ruler was [[Puyi]], who as a small child had been the last Emperor of China.  He was deposed during the revolution of 1911, and now the Japanese brought him back in a powerless role.  Only Axis countries recognized Manchukuo.  The United States in 1932 announced the [[Stimson Doctrine]] stating that it would never recognize Japanese sovereignty.  Japan modernized the economy and operated it as a satellite to the Japanese economy.  It was out of range of American bombers, so its factories continued their output to the end.  Manchukuo  was returned to China in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Prasenjit Duara, ''Sovereignty and Authenticity: Manchukuo and the East Asian Modern'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Japan seized control of China proper in 1937–38, the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army set up the [[Reorganized National Government of China]], a puppet state, under the nominal leadership of [[Wang Jingwei|Wang Ching-wei]] (1883–1944). It was based in  Nanjing. The Japanese were in full control; the puppet state declared war on the Allies in 1943.  Wang was allowed to administer the International Settlement in Shanghai.  The puppet state had an army of 900,000 soldiers, and was positioned against the Nationalist army under [[Chiang Kai-shek]].  It did little fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald E. Bunker,  Peace Conspiracy: Wang Ching-wei and the China War, 1937–41'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David P. Barrett and Larry N. Shyu, eds. ''Chinese Collaboration with Japan, 1932–1945: The Limits of Accommodation'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military defeats====
The [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], initially appeared to be a major success that knocked out the American battle fleet—but it missed the aircraft carriers that were at sea and ignored vital shore facilities whose destruction could have crippled US Pacific operations. Ultimately, the attack proved a long-term strategic disaster that actually inflicted relatively little significant long-term damage while provoking the United States to seek revenge in an all-out [[total war]] in which no terms short of [[unconditional surrender]] would be entertained.

[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|200px|[[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic cloud over Hiroshima]], 1945]]
However, as Admiral Yamamoto warned, Japan's six-month window of military advantage following Pearl Harbor ended with the Japanese Navy's offensive ability being crippled at the hands of the American Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]].  As the war became one of mass production and logistics, the U.S. built  a far stronger navy with more numerous warplanes, and a superior communications and logistics system. The Japanese had stretched too far and were unable to supply its forward bases—many soldiers died of starvation. Japan built warplanes in large quantity but the quality plunged, and the performance of poorly trained pilots spiraled downward.&lt;ref&gt;Eric M Bergerud, ''Fire In The Sky: The Air War In The South Pacific'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial Navy lost a series of major battles, from Midway (1942) to the Philippine Sea (1944) and Leyte Gulf (1945), which put American long-range B-29 bombers in range. A series of massive raids burned out much of Tokyo and 64 major industrial cities beginning in March 1945 while [[Operation Starvation]] seriously disrupted the nation's vital internal shipping lanes. Regardless of how the war was becoming hopeless, the circle around the Emperor held fast and refused to open negotiations. Finally in August, two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria demonstrated the cause was futile, and [[Hirohito]] authorized a surrender whereby he kept his throne.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Bix, ''Hirohito and the making of modern Japan'' (2001)  pp. 487–32&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deaths====
Total Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war. Starvation or malnutrition-related illness accounted for roughly 80 percent of Japanese military deaths in the Philippines, and 50 percent of military fatalities in China. The aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities appears to have taken a minimum of 400,000 and possibly closer to 600,000 civilian lives (over 100,000 in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, and 80,000–150,000 civilian deaths in the battle of Okinawa). Civilian death among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;John Dower  &quot;Lessons from Iwo Jima&quot;.

===Finland===
{{Main article|Military history of Finland during World War II}}
[[File:Hitler Mannerheim 2.jpg|upright|thumb|Hitler and Finnish commander-in-chief [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Field Marshal
Mannerheim]] (right)]]

Although Finland officially was not a part of the Axis, it was aligned with Germany in a war against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vehviläinen |first1=Olli |title= Finland in the Second World War |year=2002 |publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henrik O. Lunde, ''Finland's War of Choice: The Troubled German-Finnish Alliance in World War II'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  The August 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence. Finland before 1918 had been a province of Russia, and many Finnish speakers lived in neighboring parts of Russia. After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939 during the [[Winter War]], intending to establish a communist puppet government in Finland.  Finland won very wide popular support in Britain and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Forster, &quot;Finland's Foreign Policy 1940–1941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy,&quot; ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp&amp;nbsp;109–123&lt;/ref&gt;  The arms-length collaboration with Germany stemmed from a precarious balance struck by the Finns in order to avoid antagonizing Britain and the United States. In the end Britain declared war to satisfy the needs of its Soviet policy, but did not engage in combat against Finland. Finland concluded armistice negotiations with the USSR under strong German pressure to continue the war, while British and American acted in accord with their own alliances with the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomo Polvinen, &quot;The Great Powers and Finland 1941–1944,&quot; ''Revue Internationale d'Histoire Militaire'' (1985), Issue 62, pp&amp;nbsp;133–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet success in Finland would threaten Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region. The Soviets overwhelmed the Finnish resistance in the [[Winter War]], and a peace treaty was signed in March 1940. It ceded some Finnish territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Jakobson, ''The Diplomacy of the Winter War: An Account of the Russo-Finnish War, 1939–1940'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Winter War, Finland sought protection and support from the Britain and Sweden without success. Finland drew closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories. Finland declared war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941 in what is called the [[Continuation War]].&lt;ref&gt;Mauno Jokipii, . &quot;Finland's Entrance into the Continuation War,&quot; ''Revue Internationale d'Histoire Militaire'' (1982), Issue 53, pp&amp;nbsp;85–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  To meet Stalin's demands, Britain reluctantly declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]].

Finland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during [[Operation Silverfox]], a joint offensive against Murmansk.&lt;ref name=&quot;MannJörgensen2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Mann and Christer Jörgensen|title=Hitler's Arctic War: The German Campaigns in Norway, Finland, and the USSR 1940–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhZoR0N6UgMC&amp;pg=PA69|year=2003|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland refused German requests to participate actively in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and also granted asylum to Jews, while Jewish soldiers continued to serve in its army.

The relationship between Finland and Germany more closely resembled an alliance during the six weeks of the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]], which was presented as a German condition for help with munitions and air support, as the [[Fourth strategic offensive|Soviet offensive coordinated with D-Day]] threatened Finland with complete occupation. The agreement bound Finland not to seek a separate peace with Moscow.

After Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, Ryti's successor as president, Marshall Mannerheim, dismissed the agreement and opened secret negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. Under the terms of the armistice, Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947.

==Governments in Exile==
Britain welcomed governments in exile to set up their headquarters in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Conway and José Gotovitch, eds.|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain, 1940–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxN5K9pAG1gC|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst others were set up in neutral or other allied territory. Recognition for these bodies would vary and change over time.

===Poland===
Most Polish leaders fled to Romania, where they were interred. Other leaders escaped to France, and later to London, where the [[Polish government-in-exile]] was set up by [[Władysław Sikorski|General Sikorski]]. It was recognized by the Allies until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadeta Tendyra, ''The Polish Government in Exile, 1939–45'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed'' ch 11-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[Polish Underground State|underground resistance movement]] formed inside Poland; it nominally reported to the government in exile. During the war about 400,000 Poles joined the underground [[Polish Home Army]], about 200,000 went into [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|combat on western fronts]] in units loyal to the Polish government in exile, and about 300,000 [[Polish Armed Forces in the East#Berling Army: 1943-1945|fought under Soviet command]] in the last stages of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'' (2006)  pp.&amp;nbsp;264–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied.pdf|thumb|right|&quot;The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland&quot;, note of [[Polish government-in-exile]] addressed to the [[Allies of WWII|wartime allies]] of the then-[[Declaration by United Nations|United Nations]], 1942]]
Since the start of the war the body protested on the international stage against the German occupation of their territory and the treatment of their civilian population. In 1940 the Polish Ministry of Information produced a list of those it believed had been murdered by the Nazis. Later in 1942 Poland addressed the governments of the Allies (the &quot;United Nations&quot;) with a publication entitled &quot;The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland&quot;.

===Norway===
After Germany swept to control in April 1940, the government in exile, including the royal family, was based in London.  Politics were suspended and the government coordinated action with the Allies, retained control of a worldwide diplomatic and consular service, and operated the huge Norwegian merchant marine. It organized and supervised the resistance within Norway. One long-term impact was the abandonment of a traditional Scandinavian policy of neutrality; Norway became a founding member of NATO in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Erik J. Friis, &quot;The Norwegian Government-In-Exile, 1940-45&quot; in ''Scandinavian Studies. Essays Presented to Dr. Henry Goddard Leach on the Occasion of his Eighty-fifth Birthday'' (1965), p422-444.&lt;/ref&gt;  Norway at the start of the war had the world's fourth largest merchant fleet, at 4.8 million tons, including a fifth of the world's oil tankers. The Germans captured about 20% of the fleet but the remainder, about 1000 ships, were taken over by the government.  Although half the ships were sunk, the earnings paid the expenses of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Dear and Foot, ''Oxford Companion'' (1995) pp&amp;nbsp;818–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johs Andenaes, ''Norway and the Second World War'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The government in 1940 fled to London, where it had command of some colonies as well as the Dutch navy and merchant marine.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Woodruff, ''Relations between the Netherlands Government-in-Exile and occupied Holland during World War II'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; When they arrived in London the Government in exile considered itself still neutral but found its desire for the liberation of the Netherlands coinciding with the war aims of the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;van Panhuys, HF (1978) International Law in the Netherlands, Volume 1, T.M.C. Asser Instituut P99&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of France the Dutch Prime Minister [[Dirk Jan de Geer]] advocated negotiating a separate peace between the Netherlands and the Third Reich. [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] fearing that the loss of the [[Dutch East Indies]] to Japan would be a term of any treaty vetoed any agreement. On 3 September 1940 the Queen dismissed her prime minister and replaced him with [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy]], who worked with Churchill and Roosevelt on ways to smooth the path for an American entry. [[Aruba]] together with [[Curaçao]] the then world-class exporting oil refineries were the main suppliers of refined products to the Allies. Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945. On November 23, 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States occupied [[Suriname|Dutch Guiana]] to protect the bauxite mines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/fdrneutr/Home.html World War II Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czechoslovak government-in-exile was an informal title given to the Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee originally created by the former Czechoslovak President, [[Edvard Beneš]] in Paris in October 1939.&lt;ref name=Crampton&gt;Crampton, R. J. ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century — and after''. Routledge. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsuccessful negotiations with [[France]] for diplomatic status, as well as the impending [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation of France]], forced the Committee to withdraw to [[London]] in 1940. The body was eventually considered, by those countries that recognized it, as the legal continuation of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]].

===Belgium===
{{main article|Belgium in World War II}}
The German invasion lasted only 18 days in 1939 before the Belgian army surrendered. The king remained behind, but the government escaped to France and then to England in 1940.  Belgium was liberated in late 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Eliezer Yapou, ''Governments in Exile, 1939–1945: Leadership from London and Resistance at Home'' (1998) ch 4 [http://governmentsinexile.com/yapoubelgium.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgium had two holdings in Africa, the very large colony of the [[Belgian Congo]] and the mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The Belgian Congo was not occupied and remained loyal to the Allies as a useful economic asset. The government in exile sold 3.4 million pounds of uranium ore from the Congo to the U.S. for the atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan E. Helmreich|title=United States Relations with Belgium and the Congo, 1940–1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvsynDQxpekC&amp;pg=PA54|year=1998|publisher=U. of Delaware Press|pages=43–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Troops from the Belgian Congo participated in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] against the Italians. The colonial ''[[Force Publique]]'' also served in other theatres alongside British forces.

===Yugoslavia===

===Korea===
Based in the Chinese city of [[Shanghai]] and later [[Chongqing]] the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea acted as the Korean government-in-exile from 13 April 1919 until the [[Republic of Korea]] was established in 1948.

==List of all War Declarations and other outbreaks of hostilities==
{{main article|Declarations of War during World War II}}
Regarding ''type'' of war outbreak (fourth column):  
'''A''' = Attack without a declaration of war, '''U''' = State of war emerged through ultimatum, '''WD''' = State of war emerged after formal declaration of war, '''D''' = Diplomatic breakdown leading to a state of war. In some cases a diplomatic breakdown later led to a state of war. Such cases are mentioned in the comments.

'''Liberation Route Europe''' is an international remembrance trail that connects the main regions along the advance of the Western Allied Forces during the [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation of Europe]] and final stage of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The route started in 2008 as a Dutch regional initiative in the [[Arnhem-Nijmegen Metropolitan Area|Arnhem-Nijmegen]] area and then developed into a transnational route that was officially inaugurated in [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]] on June 6, 2014 during the [[Normandy]] [[Normandy landings|D-day]] commemorations. The route goes from [[Southern England]] through [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and then extends to [[Poland]]. The southern route starts in [[Italy]]. As a form of remembrance tourism LRE aims to unfold these Allied offensives of 1944 and 1945 in one narrative combining the different perspectives and points of view. By combining locations with personal stories of people who fought and suffered, it gives visitors the opportunity to follow the Allied march and visit significant sites from [[War grave|war cemeteries]] to museums and monuments but also events and commemorations.

== The Route ==
[[File:Heinkel He 111 during the Battle of Britain.jpg|thumb]]

=== Great Britain ===
After the [[Battle of France|fall of France in 1940]] and their own defeat on the continent, the British troops regrouped and took the air to defend their island, known as the [[Battle of Britain]]. The route starts in [[London]] and here goes through [[Kent]] ([[Operation Fortitude|Operation Fortitude South]], [[Operation Pluto]] and [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]]) and [[Hampshire]] (where [[Operation Overlord]] was prepared).

==== Normandy ====
During [[Operation Overlord]], the largest amphibious assault in history, [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] landed on five beaches along a 50-mile stretch of [[Normandy landings|Normandy coast on D-Day]]. This operation marked the start of the [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] of Western Europe. The route here comprises the 5 landing beaches: [[Sword Beach]] (from [[Ouistreham]] to [[Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados|Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer]]), [[Gold Beach]] (between [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]]  and [[La Rivière-Saint-Sauveur|La Rivière]]), [[Utah Beach]] (Sainte-Marie-du-Mont), [[Omaha Beach]] (from [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes]] to [[Vierville-sur-Mer]]), [[Juno Beach]] (from [[Courseulles-sur-Mer|Courseulles]] to [[Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados|Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer]]) along with [[Pointe du Hoc]] ([[Cricqueville-en-Bessin|Criqueville-en-Bessin]]), [[Ranville]] (British Airlandings) or [[Longues-sur-Mer]] ([[Longues-sur-Mer battery|German Battery]]).

The following [[Normandy Campaign|Battle of Normandy]] resulted not only in the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers, but also many French civilians. Almost all of the larger cities in the region were badly damaged.

[[File:The Liberation of Paris, 25 - 26 August 1944 HU66477.jpg|thumb|Liberation of Paris]]

==== Paris ====
An uprising of the population against the Germans on August 19 forced the Allies to send troops to [[Liberation of Paris|liberate Paris]], while it was not a priority. The [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd French Armoured Division]] entered Paris on the evening of August 24. The capitulation was signed on the [[Île de la Cité]], and the German troops surrendered at the Montparnasse train station.

[[File:Looted_Art_-_German_loot_stored_at_Schlosskirche_Ellingen_-_Ellingen_(Bavaria_-_Germany).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|German repository of looted possessions in a church at Ellingen, Bavaria, May 1945.]]
&quot;The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property&quot; was a ground-breaking international symposium held in New York City in 1995 to discuss the artworks, cultural property, and historic sites damaged, lost, and [[Nazi plunder|plundered as a result of World War II]]. The three-day event was sponsored by the [[Bard Graduate Center]] for Studies in the Decorative Arts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;January 19–21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organized by [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Elizabeth Simpson]], an archaeologist and professor at the Bard Graduate Center.

Worldwide interest in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory at the end of the war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the opening of official negotiations on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.

==New York conference and proceedings==
[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|Generals Bradley, Patton, and Eisenhower examining works of art stored by the Nazis in the Merkers mine, Germany, April 1945.]]The program featured 48 notable speakers—government officials, diplomats, journalists, art historians, archaeologists, lawyers, and independent researchers—from Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Australia, England, and the United States. The combined testimony laid bare another horrifying dimension to the anguish of human suffering wrought by the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The symposium was the first to address the issue in a public forum, and led to numerous initiatives on provenance research by the governments involved as well as museums, libraries, and art dealers internationally. As a result, the art world was changed irrevocably. Acquisitions policies were revised and organizations restructured to facilitate the identification of artistic and cultural objects that had been stolen or transferred illegally during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aamd.org/standards-and-practices |title=Standards &amp; Practices &amp;#124; Association of Art Museum Directors |website=Aamd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes were established to allow families to claim their missing property; such claims have resulted in many works being restored to the heirs and descendants of the rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/home |title=Welcome to |publisher=Lootedart.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Spoils of War cover.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spoils of War'' (1997), showing paintings stolen from the Russian palaces at Petrodvorets and Pushkin, abandoned in March 1945 in East Prussia by German soldiers fleeing the Red Army.]]

The conference proceedings were published in an award-winning volume edited by Elizabeth Simpson (Harry N. Abrams, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Elizabeth. ''The Spoils of War--World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property''. New York: [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]] in association with the Bard Graduate Center, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes 17 treaties, conventions, and other official documents relating to the protection and return of cultural property. These begin with the &quot;[[Lieber Code]]&quot; of 1863 and the &quot;[[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]],&quot; and continue with the treaties following World War I, the &quot;[[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954]]&quot; for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]]&quot; on the prevention of illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects]] of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention |title=Cultural Property - 1995 Convention - Unidroit - International Institute for the Unification of Private Law - Institut International pour l'Unification du droit privè |publisher=Unidroit |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses resulting from World War II==
Elizabeth Simpson and lawyer Jeanette Greenfield, author of ''The Return of Cultural Treasures'',&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette. ''The Return of Cultural Treasures.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; provided introductory comments on the subject, along with [[Lynn H. Nicholas|Lynn Nicholas]], author of ''The Rape of Europa'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn. ''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''. New York: Vintage Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; who discussed the massive displacement of art and cultural property that occurred during World War II. Individual countries detailed the damage to their national patrimony, as well as losses suffered by individuals. A talk on Jewish ceremonial art and private property was given by Vivian Mann, then Chair of Judaica at [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|The Jewish Museum]], New York. These reports were followed by a series of contributions on laws, directives, and conventions in place at the beginning of World War II, directives in force in Germany during the war, and laws enacted by the Allies to counter German appropriations. These and all the conference presentations are published in the proceedings (see list of contributors below).

==The &quot;Monuments Men&quot;==
[[File:Capt Edith Standen at Central Collecting Point Wiesbaden 1946.jpg|thumb|Captain Edith Standen at the Wiesbaden Collecting Point, 1946.]]A group of the so-called [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art|&quot;Monuments Men&quot;]] (which in fact included several women) detailed their firsthand accounts of the work of the art-specialist officers of the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentsmen.com |title=Official Site |publisher=The Monuments Men |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section]] of the [[Office of Military Government, United States]], recounted the discovery of [[looted art]] and stashed bullion in German mines, bunkers, castles, and churches, along with the redistribution and repatriation of these finds through the Munich and Wiesbaden Collecting Points. Of the veteran officers speaking the New York conference—[[Edith Standen|Edith A. Standen]] (d. 1998), James S. Plaut (d. 1996), [[Craig Hugh Smyth]] (d. 2006), [[Walter Farmer|Walter I. Farmer]] (d. 1997), [[S. Lane Faison]] (d. 2006), and Bernard Taper—only Bernard Taper is still living today.

==Reappearance and recovery==
Other repatriations occurred at the end of the war, effected by the US State Department, the USSR, and other countries. Case studies include fascinating discussions of the [[Theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg Church Treasures]], the Soviet Secret Repositories,&lt;ref&gt;Akinsha, Konstantin, Grigorii Kozlov, and Sylvia Hochfield. ''Beautiful Loot: The Soviet Plunder of Europe's Art Treasures'', New York: Random House, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Treasure of Priam,&quot; which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann at Troy in 1873, shipped out of Turkey illegally by Schliemann, ended up in Berlin, transferred to Moscow by the Soviet Trophy Brigades after the fall of Berlin, held in secret in the Pushkin Museum, and finally brought out of the secret repository and exhibited in the museum in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, Vladimir, and Mikhail Treister. ''The Gold of Troy: Searching for Homer’s Fabled City''. Moscow and New York: Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in association with Harry N. Abrams, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims to ownership of the Trojan treasures by Turkey, Germany, and Greece, the objects remain in Moscow with the issue unresolved.[[File:Sophia Schliemann wearing Treasure A, Troy.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|Heinrich Schliemann's wife, Sophia, wearing gold jewelry from Treasure A, Troy, ca. 1873.]]

==Current issues and cooperative efforts==
The conference concluded with a series of presentations on current and proposed efforts to mitigate the losses suffered. Lyndel Prott, then Chief of the International Standards Section of the Cultural Heritage Division of [[UNESCO]], offered a list of &quot;Principles for the Resolution of Disputes Concerning Cultural Heritage Displaced during the Second World War&quot;:

# Cultural objects that have been taken from territory occupied during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War by any belligerent will be returned to the country from which they have been taken.
#Where there have been successive displacements, the objects will be returned to the territory where they were located at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939.
#Principle 1 will apply whether  transfers of the cultural objects concerned have taken the form of open looting or plunder, or of transactions apparently legal in form, even when they purport to have been voluntarily effected.
#Cultural property taken from an occupied territory shall never be detained as war reparations.
#Where cultural objects displaced during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War have passed into the hands of third parties, the state that is responsible for their removal from the country where they were located in 1939 shall reacquire them for return to the state from which they were taken, by repurchase, indemnity or other appropriate means.
#No time limits can be set.
#Cultural objects being repatriated are to be accompanied by the relevant scientific documentation where available.
#Restitution by replacement is an available remedy where unique cultural objects have been destroyed.

==Press coverage and controversy==
The &quot;Spoils of War&quot; symposium was covered extensively in the international press, including articles carried by the [[Associated Press]] and in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''New York [[Newsday]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', and ''[[Pravda]]''. The [[The Forward|''Jewish Forward'']] published a critique that appeared on the first day of the conference; at issue was whether or not the conference gave sufficient weight to Jewish wartime losses, since these losses were detailed within the greater context of the Second World War and the damages experienced by the peoples of the many nations involved.

[[File:Amber Room Catherine Palace Tsarskoye Selo pre-war photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The original [[Amber Room]] in the [[Catherine Palace]], Pushkin (Tsarskoye Selo), Russia, in an early 20th century photograph before it was lost as a result of the Second World War.]]This issue sparked a second conference in Washington, DC, in 1998. Sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the &quot;Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled participants from the New York symposium along with others to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. This resulted in a further set of &quot;[[Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm |title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art |publisher=State.gov |date=1998-12-03 |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by organizer [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]], as well as &quot;Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/decl.htm |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York conference has remained influential, however, due to its broader scope—dealing as it did with losses that occurred throughout Europe, inflicted not only by the Germans but also by the Soviets and western Allies, and affecting all those peoples who suffered as a result of the Second World War. The volume of conference proceedings was reviewed widely by publications in the United States and Europe, as well as ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'', [[Russian News Agency TASS|''ITAR-TASS'']], and others. As the only comprehensive treatment of the subject, it is cited frequently, considered one of the most important books on World War II and its aftermath—and the loss, reappearance, and recovery of cultural property relating to the war.

The term '''&quot;German collective guilt&quot;''' refers to the notion of [[collective guilt]] attributed to [[Germany]] and the [[German people]] for [[Responsibility for the Holocaust|perpetrating the Holocaust and starting World War II]].

Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] wrote an influential essay in 1945 about this concept as a psychological phenomenon, in which he asserted that the German people felt a collective guilt (''Kollektivschuld'') for the atrocities committed by their fellow countrymen, and so introduced the term into German intellectual discourse. Jung said collective guilt was &quot;for psychologists a fact, and it will be one of the most important tasks of therapy to bring the Germans to recognize this guilt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Guilt and Defense |author=Jeffrey K. Olick, Andrew J. Perrin |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-674-03603-1 |pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the British and US occupation forces promoted shame and guilt with a [[Denazification#Collective guilt campaign|publicity campaign]], which included posters depicting concentration camps with slogans such as &quot;These Atrocities: Your Fault!&quot; (''Diese Schandtaten: Eure Schuld!'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Guilt of Nations? |author=Jeffrey K. Olick |doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.2003.tb00443.x |journal=Ethics &amp; International Affairs |volume=17 |number=2 |pages=109–117 |date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theologian [[Martin Niemöller]] and other churchmen accepted shared guilt in the ''Stuttgarter Schuldbekenntnis'' ([[Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt]]) of 1945. The philosopher and psychologist [[Karl Jaspers]] delivered lectures to students in 1946 which were published under the title ''The Question of German Guilt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Accountability for Collective Wrongdoing |author=Tracy Isaacs, Richard Vernon |pages=196–199 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-521-17611-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Axis powers''' ({{lang-de|Achsenmächte}}, {{lang-ja|枢軸国}} ''Sūjikukoku'', {{lang-it|Potenze dell'Asse}}), also known as the '''Rome–Berlin–Tokyo Axis''', were the nations that fought in [[World War II]] against the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]. The Axis agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity.

The Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the treaty signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936. [[Mussolini]] declared on 1 November that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome–Berlin axis, thus creating the term &quot;Axis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornelia Schmitz-Berning |title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=745 |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-11-019549-1 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GlobSec&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/axis.htm |title=Axis |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anti-communist treaty between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] joined the Pact in 1937. The &quot;Rome–Berlin Axis&quot; became a [[Collective defense|military alliance]] in 1939 under the so-called &quot;[[Pact of Steel]]&quot;, with the [[Tripartite Pact]] of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany and its two treaty-bound allies.

At its zenith during [[World War II]], the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of Europe, North Africa, and East Asia. There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal, with a bit more between Germany and Italy. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance. As in the case of the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war.

==Origins and creation==
{{Main article|Tripartite Pact}}
The term &quot;axis&quot; was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister [[Benito Mussolini]] in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's ''Germania Repubblica'' that &quot;there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin&quot; (''non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino'').&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dietrich Glessgen and Günter Holtus, eds., ''Genesi e dimensioni di un vocabolario etimologico'', Lessico Etimologico Italiano: Etymologie und Wortgeschichte des Italienischen (Ludwig Reichert, 1992), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was seeking an alliance with the [[Weimar Republic]] against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in the dispute over the [[Free State of Fiume]].&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;D. C. Watt, &quot;The Rome–Berlin Axis, 1936–1940: Myth and Reality&quot;, ''The Review of Politics'', 22: 4 (1960), pp. 530–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]]'s prime minister [[Gyula Gömbös]] when advocating an alliance of Hungary with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in the early 1930s.{{sfn|Sinor|1959|p=291}} Gömbös' efforts did effect the Italo-Hungarian [[Rome Protocols]], but his sudden death in 1936 while negotiating with Germany in [[Munich]] and the arrival of [[Kálmán Darányi]], his successor, ended Hungary's involvement in pursuing a trilateral axis.{{sfn|Sinor|1959|p=291}} Contentious negotiations between the Italian foreign minister, [[Galeazzo Ciano]], and the German ambassador, [[Ulrich von Hassell]], resulted in a Nineteen-Point Protocol, signed by Ciano and his German counterpart, [[Konstantin von Neurath]], in 1936. When Mussolini publicly announced the signing on 1 November, he proclaimed the creation of a Rome–Berlin axis.&lt;ref name=Watt/&gt;

===Initial proposals of a German–Italian alliance===
Italy under ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] had pursued a strategic alliance of Italy with Germany against France since the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;&gt;MacGregor Knox. Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to becoming head of government in Italy as leader of the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] movement, Mussolini had advocated alliance with recently defeated Germany after the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 settled World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt; He believed that Italy could expand its influence in Europe by allying with Germany against France.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt; In early 1923, as a goodwill gesture to Germany, Italy secretly delivered weapons for the German Army, which had faced major disarmament under the provisions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00143, Gustav Stresemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gustav Stresemann, ''Reich Chancellor of the German People'', 1923, foreign minister of Germany, 1923–1929]]
In September 1923, Mussolini offered German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] a &quot;common policy&quot;: he sought German military support against potential French military intervention over Italy's diplomatic dispute with Yugoslavia over [[Free State of Fiume|Fiume]], should an Italian seizure of Fiume result in war between Italy and Yugoslavia. The German ambassador to Italy in 1924 reported that Mussolini saw a nationalist Germany as an essential ally for Italy against France, and hoped to tap into the desire within the German army and the German political right for a war of revenge against France.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt;

During the Weimar Republic, the German government did not respect the Treaty of Versailles that it had been pressured to sign, and various government figures at the time rejected Germany's post-Versailles borders. General [[Hans von Seeckt]] (head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' command from 1920 to 1926) supported an alliance between Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] to invade and partition Poland between them and restore the German-Russian border of 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz p10&quot;&gt;Christian Leitz. Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933–1941: The Road to Global War. p10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Streseman]] as German foreign minister in 1925 declared that the reincorporation of territories lost to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] in the Treaty of Versailles was a major task of German foreign policy&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz p10&quot;/&gt; The ''Reichswehr'' Ministry memorandum of 1926 declared its intention to seek the reincorporation of German territory lost to Poland as its first priority, to be followed by the return of the Saar territory, the annexation of Austria, and remilitarization of the Rhineland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz p10&quot;/&gt;

Since the 1920s Italy had identified the year 1935 as a crucial date for preparing for a war against France, as 1935 was the year when Germany's obligations under the Treaty of Versailles were scheduled to expire.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor Knox. Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings took place in Berlin in 1924 between Italian General [[Luigi Capello]] and prominent figures in the German military, such as von Seeckt and [[Erich Ludendorff]], over military collaboration between Germany and Italy. The discussions concluded that Germans still wanted a war of revenge against France but were short on weapons and hoped that Italy could assist Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Gooch. ''Mussolini and His Generals: The Armed Forces and Fascist Foreign Policy, 1922–1940''. Cambridge University Press, 2007. P11.&lt;/ref&gt;

However at this time Mussolini stressed one important condition that Italy must pursue in an alliance with Germany: that Italy &quot;must&amp;nbsp;... tow them, not be towed by them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt; Italian foreign minister [[Dino Grandi]] in the early 1930s stressed the importance of &quot;decisive weight&quot;, involving Italy's relations between France and Germany, in which he recognized that Italy was not yet a major power, but perceived that Italy did have strong enough influence to alter the political situation in Europe by placing the weight of its support onto one side or another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Schreiber]], [[Bernd Stegemann]], [[Detlef Vogel]]. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; However Grandi stressed that Italy must seek to avoid becoming a &quot;slave of the rule of three&quot; in order to pursue its interests, arguing that although substantial Italo-French tensions existed, Italy would not unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with Germany, just as it would neither unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with France over conceivable Italo-German tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Schreiber, Bernd Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. P. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Grandi's attempts to maintain a diplomatic balance between France and Germany were challenged in 1932 by pressure from the French, who had begun to prepare an alliance with Britain and the United States against the threat of a revanchist Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The French government warned Italy that it had to choose whether to be on the side of the pro-Versailles powers or that of the anti-Versailles revanchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Grandi responded that Italy would be willing to offer France support against Germany if France gave Italy its mandate over Cameroon and allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; France refused Italy's proposed exchange for support, as it believed Italy's demands were unacceptable and the threat from Germany was not yet immediate.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt;

On 23 October 1932, Mussolini declared support for a Four Power Directorate that included Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, to bring about an orderly treaty revision outside of what he considered the outmoded [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; The proposed Directorate was pragmatically designed to reduce French hegemony in continental Europe, in order to reduce tensions between the great powers in the short term to buy Italy relief from being pressured into a specific war alliance while at the same time allowing them to benefit from diplomatic deals on treaty revisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt;

===Danube alliance, dispute over Austria===
[[File:Gombos4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gyula Gömbös]], ''Prime Minister of Hungary'', 1932–1936]]

In 1932, Gyula Gömbös and the [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] rose to power in Hungary, and immediately sought an alliance with Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Gömbös sought to alter Hungary's post–[[Treaty of Trianon]] borders by forming an alliance with Austria and Italy, knowing that Hungary alone was not capable of challenging the [[Little Entente]] powers .&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Mussolini was elated by Gömbös' offer of alliance with Italy, and they cooperated in seeking to persuade Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] to join a tripartite economic agreement with Italy and Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; At the meeting between Gömbös and Mussolini in Rome on 10 November 1932, the question came up of the sovereignty of Austria in relation to the predicted rise to power in Germany of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Mussolini was worried about Nazi ambitions towards Austria, and indicated that at least in the short term he was committed to maintaining Austria as a sovereign state.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Italy had concerns over a Germany which included Austria laying land claims to German-populated territories of the [[South Tyrol]] (also known as Alto-Adige) within Italy, which bordered Austria on the [[Brenner Pass]]. Gömbös responded to Mussolini that as the Austrians primarily identified as Germans, the [[Anschluss]] of Austria to Germany was inevitable, and advised that it would be better for Italy to have a friendly Germany across the [[Brenner Pass]] than a hostile Germany bent on entering the Adriatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Mussolini said he hoped the Anschluss could be postponed as long as possible until the breakout of a European war that he estimated would begin in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Adolf Hitler-1933.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]], ''Führer and Reich Chancellor of the German People'', 1933–1945]]
In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. His first diplomatic visitor was Gömbös. In a letter to Hitler within a day of his being appointed Chancellor, Gömbös told the Hungarian ambassador to Germany to remind Hitler &quot;that ten years ago, on the basis of our common principles and ideology, we were in contact via Dr. Scheubner-Richter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iván T. Berend]]. ''Decades of Crisis: Central and Eastern Europe Before World War 2''. First paperback edition. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 2001, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Gömbös told the Hungarian ambassador to inform Hitler of Hungary's intentions &quot;for the two countries to cooperate in foreign and economic policy&quot;.

Hitler had advocated an alliance between Germany and Italy since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Leitz. ''Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933–1941: The Road to Global War''. Pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being appointed Chancellor, Hitler sent a personal message to Mussolini, declaring &quot;admiration and homage&quot; and declaring his anticipation of the prospects of German-Italian friendship and even alliance.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware that Italy held concerns over potential German land claims on South Tyrol, and assured Mussolini that Germany was not interested in South Tyrol. Hitler in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' had declared that South Tyrol was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German–Italian alliance. After Hitler's rise to power, the Four Power Directorate proposal by Italy had been looked at with interest by Britain, but Hitler was not committed to it, resulting in Mussolini urging Hitler to consider the diplomatic advantages Germany would gain by breaking out of isolation by entering the Directorate and avoiding an immediate armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Power Directorate proposal stipulated that Germany would no longer be required to have limited arms and would be granted the right to re-armament under foreign supervision in stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn2&quot;&gt;[[H. James Burgwyn]]. ''Italian foreign policy in the interwar period'', 1918–1940. Westport, Connecticut, USA: [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1997. P. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler completely rejected the idea of controlled rearmament under foreign supervision.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn2&quot;/&gt;

Mussolini did not trust Hitler's intentions regarding Anschluss nor Hitler's promise of no territorial claims on South Tyrol.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn3&quot;&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini informed Hitler that he was satisfied with the presence of the anti-Marxist government of Dollfuss in Austria, and warned Hitler that he was adamantly opposed to Anschluss.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn3&quot;/&gt; Hitler responded in contempt to Mussolini that he intended &quot;to throw Dollfuss into the sea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn3&quot;/&gt; With this disagreement over Austria, relations between Hitler and Mussolini steadily became more distant.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn3&quot;/&gt;

Hitler attempted to break the impasse with Italy over Austria by sending [[Hermann Göring]] to negotiate with Mussolini in 1933 to convince Mussolini to press the Austrian government to appoint members of Austria's Nazis to the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn4&quot;&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Göring claimed that Nazi domination of Austria was inevitable and that Italy should accept this, as well as repeating to Mussolini of Hitler's promise to &quot;regard the question of the South Tyrol frontier as finally liquidated by the peace treaties&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn4&quot;/&gt; In response to Göring's visit with Mussolini, Dollfuss immediately went to Italy to counter any German diplomatic headway.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn4&quot;/&gt; Dollfuss claimed that his government was actively challenging Marxists in Austria and claimed that once the Marxists were defeated in Austria, that support for Austria's Nazis would decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn4&quot;/&gt;

In 1934, Hitler and Mussolini met for the first time, in [[Venice]]. The meeting did not proceed amicably. Hitler demanded that Mussolini compromise on Austria by pressuring Dollfuss to appoint Austrian Nazis to his cabinet, to which Mussolini flatly refused the demand. In response, Hitler promised that he would accept Austria's independence for the time being, saying that due to the internal tensions in Germany (referring to sections of the Nazi SA that Hitler would soon kill in the [[Night of the Long Knives]]) that Germany could not afford to provoke Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;neville&quot;&gt;Peter Neville. ''Mussolini''. London, England: Routledge, 2004. P. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galeazzo Ciano]] told the press that the two leaders had made a &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; to avoid interfering in Austria.&lt;ref name=&quot;knickerbocker1941&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal &amp; Hitchcock | author=[[Knickerbocker, H.R.]] | year=1941 | pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pp.&amp;nbsp;123–125.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|knickerbocker1941}} Mussolini rapidly deployed several army divisions and air squadrons to the [[Brenner Pass]], and warned that a German move against Austria would result in war between Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Martel]].

Relations between Germany and Italy recovered due to Hitler's support of [[Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935]], while other countries condemned the invasion and advocated sanctions against Italy.

===Development of German–Japanese–Italian alliance===
[[File:Fumimaro Konoe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Fumimaro Konoe]], prime minister of Japan, 1937–1940]]

Interest in Germany and Japan in forming an alliance began when Japanese diplomat [[Oshima Hiroshi]] visited [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in Berlin in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt; Oshima informed von Ribbentrop of Japan's interest in forming a German-Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; Von Ribbentrop expanded on Oshima's proposal by advocating that the alliance be based in a political context of a pact to oppose the [[Comintern]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; The proposed pact was met with mixed reviews in Japan, with a faction of ultra-nationalists within the government supporting the pact while the Japanese Navy and the Japanese Foreign Ministry were staunchly opposed to the pact.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. P. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; There was great concern in the Japanese government that such a pact with Germany could disrupt Japan's relations with Britain, endangering years of a beneficial Anglo-Japanese accord, that had allowed Japan to ascend in the international community in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. P. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The response to the pact was met with similar division in Germany; while the proposed pact was popular amongst the upper echelons of the Nazi Party, it was opposed by many in the Foreign Ministry, the Army, and the business community who held financial interests in China to which Japan was hostile.

On learning of German–Japanese negotiations, Italy also began to take an interest in forming an alliance with Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; Italy had hoped that due to Japan's long-term close relations with Britain, that an Italo-Japanese alliance could pressure Britain into adopting a more accommodating stance towards Italy in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1936, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano informed Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura Yotaro, &quot;I have heard that a Japanese-German agreement concerning the Soviet Union has been reached, and I think it would be natural for a similar agreement to be made between Italy and Japan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; Initially Japan's attitude towards Italy's proposal was generally dismissive, viewing a German–Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union as imperative while regarding an Italo-Japanese alliance as secondary, as Japan anticipated that an Italo-Japanese alliance would antagonize Britain that had condemned Italy's invasion of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; This attitude by Japan towards Italy altered in 1937 after the League of Nations condemned Japan for aggression in China and faced international isolation, while Italy remained favourable to Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; As a result of Italy's support for Japan against international condemnation, Japan took a more positive attitude towards Italy and offered proposals for a non-aggression or neutrality pact with Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. Pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Axis powers&quot; formally took the name after the Tripartite Pact was signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan on 27 September 1940, in Berlin. The pact was subsequently joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Slovakia (24 November 1940), and Bulgaria (1 March 1941).{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=91}}

==Ideology==
In ideological terms the Axis powers described their goals as breaking the hegemony of [[plutocracy|plutocratic]]-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] Western powers and defending civilization from [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945''. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995. P. 379&lt;/ref&gt; The Axis championed authoritarianism, autarky, and a variant of capitalism that integrated state management and investment. Finally, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and imperial Japan sought empires as essential to eliminating social divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Baranowski. ''Axis Imperialism in the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic resources==
The Axis population in 1938 was 258.9 million, while the Allied population (excluding the Soviet Union and the United States, who later joined the Allies) was 689.7 million.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=3}} Thus the Allied powers outnumbered the Axis powers by 2.7 to 1.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=4}} The leading Axis states had the following domestic populations: Germany 75.5 million (including 6.8 million from recently annexed [[Austria]]), Japan 71.9 million (excluding its colonies), and Italy 43.4 million (excluding its colonies). The United Kingdom (excluding its colonies) had a population of 47.5 million and France (excluding its colonies) 42 million.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=3}}

The wartime [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the Axis was $911 billion at its highest in 1941 in [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]] by 1990 prices.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=10}} The GDP of the Allied powers was $1,798 billion. The United States stood at $1,094 billion, more than the Axis combined.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=10, 25}}

The burden of the war upon participating countries has been measured through the percentage of [[gross national product]] (GNP) devoted to military expenditures.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} Nearly one-quarter of Germany's GNP was committed to the war effort in 1939, and this rose to three-quarters of GNP in 1944, prior to the collapse of the economy.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} In 1939, Japan committed 22 percent of its GNP to its war effort in China; this rose to three-quarters of GNP in 1944.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} Italy did not mobilize its economy; its GNP committed to the war effort while remaining at prewar levels.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}}

Italy and Japan lacked industrial capacity; their economies were small, dependent on [[international trade]], external sources of fuel and other industrial resources.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} As a result, Italian and Japanese mobilization remained low, even by 1943.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}}

Among the three major Axis powers, Japan had the lowest per capita income, while Germany and Italy had an income level comparable to the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=19}}

P. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; However Hitler clearly had designs for Germany to become the dominant and leading state in the world, such as his intention for Germany's capital of Berlin to become the ''Welthauptstadt'' (&quot;World Capital&quot;), renamed [[Welthauptstadt Germania|Germania]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitler's Germany: Origins, Interpretations, Legacies. London, England: Routledge, 1939. P. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The German government also justified its actions by claiming that Germany inevitably needed to territorially expand because it was facing an [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] crisis that Hitler described: &quot;We are overpopulated and cannot feed ourselves from our own resources&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen J. Lee 1945. P. 237&quot;&gt;Stephen J. Lee. Europe, 1890–1945. P. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus expansion was justified as an inevitable necessity to provide ''[[lebensraum]]'' (&quot;living space&quot;) for the German nation and end the country's overpopulation within existing confined territory, and provide resources necessary to its people's well-being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen J.

P38&quot;&gt;John Stoessinger. ''Why Nations Go to War''. Cengage Learning, 2010.

''Hitler's Ethic: The Nazi Pursuit of Evolutionary Progress''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. P167.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time however Germany did prepare for war in the cause of ''lebensraum'', and in the late 1930s Hitler emphasized the need for a military build-up to prepare for a potential clash between the peoples of Germany and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weikart. ''Hitler's Ethic: The Nazi Pursuit of Evolutionary Progress''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. P168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany justified its war against Poland on the issues of German minority within Poland and Polish opposition to the incorporation of the German-majority [[Free City of Danzig]] into Germany. While Hitler and the Nazi party before taking power openly talked about destroying Poland and were hostile to Poles, after gaining power until February 1939 Hitler tried to conceal his true intentions towards Poland and revealed them only to his closest associates.&lt;ref&gt;Stutthof.

P44&quot;/&gt; Ribbentrop in private discussion with German officials stated that he hoped that by offering Poland large new territories in the Soviet Union, that Germany would gain not only from Polish cooperation in a war with the Soviet Union, but also that Poland would cooperate by transferring the Polish Corridor to Germany in exchange for these gains, because though it would lose access to the [[Baltic Sea]], it would gain access to the [[Black Sea]] via Ukraine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Pinkus 2005.

A [[Danzig crisis|diplomatic crisis erupted]] following Hitler demanding that the Free City of Danzig be annexed to Germany, as it was led by a Nazi government seeking annexation to Germany. Germany used legal precedents to justify its intervention against Poland and annexation of the [[Free City of Danzig]] (led by a local Nazi government that sought incorporation into Germany) in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;C.

Germany justified its invasion of the [[Low Countries]] of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in May 1940 by claiming that it suspected that Britain and France were preparing to use the Low Countries to launch an invasion of the industrial [[Ruhr]] region of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000. P. 649&quot;&gt;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald. ''Documents and Cases, Volumes 1-2''. The Hague, Netherlands: Kluwer Law International, 2000.

Declarations of neutrality must be ignored&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000. P. 649&quot;/&gt; In a conference with Germany's military leaders on 23 November 1939, Hitler declared to the military leaders that &quot;We have an [[Achilles heel]], the Ruhr&quot;, and said that &quot;If England and France push through Belgium and Holland into the Ruhr, we shall be in the greatest danger&quot;, and thus claimed that Belgium and the Netherlands had to be occupied by Germany to protect Germany from a British-French offensive against the Ruhr, irrespective of their claims to neutrality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000.

In April 1941, shortly after Germany and Yugoslavia completed negotiations for Yugoslavia to join the Axis, a coup d'état occurred in Yugoslavia that led to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. Germany needed access to the territory held by Yugoslavia to allow German forces to have a direct route to travel through, to reach and rescue Italian military forces that were faltering in their campaign in Greece. There was substantial animosity towards the alliance amongst Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group, who had fought German Austrians and Germany on the side of the Allies in World War I, and three Serb cabinet ministers resigned their positions in protest after the alliance was signed. Hitler initially attempted to be conciliatory to the Serbs who held animosity to the agreement, saying that he &quot;understood the feelings&quot; of those Serbs who opposed the alliance. Amidst the negotiations, Hitler expressed concern to Italian foreign minister Ciano that he sensed trouble coming in Belgrade. A coup d'état occurred in Yugoslavia in which a government rose to power and abandoned its association with the Axis. Hitler accused the coup of being engineered by the British. The coup was at least partly supported by the British though there was substantial patriotic enthusiasm against the Pact with rallies in Belgrade. At the rallies in Belgrade immediately after the coup, people were heard to be shouting &quot;Better war than pact!&quot; and waving British, American, and French flags. Days after the coup d'état, Hitler ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;John Lukacs. The Last European War: September 1939 - December 1941. Yale University Press, 2001. pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 involved issues of ''lebensraum'', [[anti-communism]], and Soviet foreign policy. Hitler in his early years as Nazi leader had claimed that he would be willing to accept friendly relations with Russia on the tactical condition that Russia agree to return to the borders established by the German–Russian peace agreement of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] signed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] in 1918 which gave large territories held by Russia to German control in exchange for peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter D. Stachura P. 31&quot; /&gt; Hitler in 1921 had commended the Treaty of Brest Litovsk as opening the possibility for restoration of relations between Germany and Russia, saying:
{{quote|''Through the peace with Russia the sustenance of Germany as well as the provision of work were to have been secured by the acquisition of land and soil, by access to raw materials, and by friendly relations between the two lands.''|Adolf Hitler, 1921&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter D. Stachura P. 31&quot;/&gt;}}
From 1921 to 1922 Hitler evoked rhetoric of both the achievement of lebensraum involving the acceptance of a territorially reduced Russia as well as supporting Russian nationals in overthrowing the Bolshevik government and establishing a new Russian government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter D. Stachura P. 31&quot;/&gt; However Hitler's attitudes changed by the end of 1922, in which he then supported an alliance of Germany with Britain to destroy Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter D. Stachura P. 31&quot;/&gt; Later Hitler declared how far into Russia he intended to expand Germany to:

Hosking. ''Rulers And Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union''. Harvard University Press, 2006 P. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the proposal to support an anti-communist Russian army was met with outright rejection by Hitler, however by 1944 as Germany faced mounting losses on the Eastern Front, Vlasov's forces were recognized by Germany as an ally, particularly by [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Andreyev.

The Geopolitics of East Asia. Routledge, 2003. Pp. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Ribbentrop described to Molotov that further extension of Germany's ''lebensraum'' was now going to be founded in [[Central Africa]], and suggested that Germany would accept the Soviet Union taking part in the partitioning of the British Empire upon a British defeat in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Stoessinger 2010.

Germany and the Soviet Union in 1940 were in dispute over their respective influences in the Balkans and the [[Turkish Straits]].

Stone. A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya. P195.&lt;/ref&gt; When negotiations with Molotov led to no resolution, Hitler determined that Britain was only continuing to fight in hope of Soviet intervention and therefore the defeat of the Soviet Union would result in the defeat of Britain and in July 1940 began planning for a possible invasion of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States, Germany supported Japan by declaring war on the US.

P. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler denounced American President Roosevelt's invoking of the term &quot;freedom&quot; to describe US actions in the war, and accused the American meaning of &quot;freedom&quot; to be the freedom for democracy to exploit the world and the freedom for plutocrats within such democracy to exploit the masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall Bennett Woods 1990.

====History====

At the end of World War I, German citizens felt that their country had been humiliated as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which included a [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|war guilt clause]] and forced Germany to pay enormous reparations payments and forfeit territories formerly controlled by German Empire and all its colonies. The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation during the early 1920s]]. In 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr|the French occupied the Ruhr region]] when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s, the [[Great Depression]] created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany's woes. The Nazis, under Hitler, promoted the nationalist [[stab-in-the-back legend]] stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists. The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] that would include [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland]], and other German-populated territories in Europe. The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]], and the Soviet Union, as part of the Nazi policy of seeking ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (&quot;living space&quot;) in eastern Europe.

Germany renounced the Versailles treaty and [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the Rhineland]] in March 1936. Germany had already resumed conscription and announced the existence of a German air force in 1935. Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in 1938]], the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudetenland]] from Czechoslovakia, and the [[Memel territory]] from [[Lithuania]] in 1939. Germany then invaded the rest of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1939, creating the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the country of [[Slovakia]].

On 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which contained a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} Germany's invasion of its part of Poland under the Pact eight days later{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} triggered the beginning of World War II. By the end of 1941, Germany occupied a large part of Europe and [[Wehrmacht|its military forces]] were fighting the Soviet Union, nearly capturing Moscow. However, crushing defeats at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Kursk]] devastated the German armed forces. This, combined with Western Allied [[Normandy Landings|landings in France]] and [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Italy]], led to a three-front war that depleted Germany's armed forces and resulted in Germany's defeat in 1945.

There was substantial internal opposition within the German military to the Nazi regime's aggressive strategy of rearmament and foreign policy in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Command Magagzine. Hitler's Army: The Evolution and Structure of German Forces 1933–1945.

P. 175&quot;/&gt; Though started by lower-ranking Nazi members, Hitler took advantage of the scandal by forcing von Blomberg and von Fritsch to resign and replaced them with opportunists who were subservient to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Command Magagzine 1945.

P. 175&quot;/&gt;

The opposition to the Nazi regime's aggressive foreign policy in the military became so strong from 1936 to 1938, that considerations of overthrowing the Nazi regime were discussed within the upper echelons of the military and remaining non-Nazi members of the German government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael C.

====Colonies and dependencies====
{{further information|Areas annexed by Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe}}

The [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was created from the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Shortly after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia declared its independence. The new Slovak State allied itself with Germany. The remainder of the country was occupied by German military forces and organized into the Protectorate. Czech civil institutions were preserved but the Protectorate was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.

The [[General Government]] was the name given to the territories of occupied Poland that were not directly annexed into German provinces, but like Bohemia and Moravia was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.

Belgium quickly surrendered to Germany, and the Belgian King remained in the country during the German military occupation from 1940 to 1944. The Belgian King cooperated closely with Germany and repeatedly sought assurances that Belgian rights would be retained once Germany achieved total victory. However, Hitler intended to annex Belgium and its Germanic population into the Greater Germanic Reich, initiated by the creation of [[Reichskommissariat Belgien]], an authority run directly by the German government that sought the incorporation of the territory into the planned Germanic Reich. However Belgium was soon occupied by Allied forces in 1944.

[[Reichskommissariat Niederlande]] was an occupation authority and territory established in the Netherlands in 1940 designated as a colony to be incorporated into the planned Greater Germanic Reich.

[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]] was established in Norway in 1940. Like the Reichskommissariats in Belgium and the Netherlands, its Germanic peoples were to be incorporated into the Greater Germanic Reich. In Norway, the [[Quisling regime]], headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]], was installed by the Germans as a client regime [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|during the occupation]], while king [[Haakon VII]] and the legal [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government were in exile]]. Quisling encouraged Norwegians to serve as volunteers [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|in the Waffen-SS]], collaborated in the deportation of Jews, and was responsible for the executions of members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].

About 45,000 Norwegian collaborators joined the pro-Nazi party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union), and some police units helped arrest many Jews. However, Norway was one of the first countries where [[resistance during World War II]] was widespread before the turning point of the war in 1943. After the war, [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Quisling and other collaborators were executed]]. Quisling's name has become an international [[eponym]] for [[traitor]].

[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] was established in the Baltic region in 1941. Unlike the western Reichskommissariats that sought the incorporation of their majority Germanic peoples, Ostland were designed for settlement by Germans who would displace the non-Germanic majority living there, as part of ''lebensraum''.

[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] was established in Ukraine in 1941. Like Ostland it was slated for settlement by Germans.

The [[Military Administration in Serbia]] was established on occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] territory in April 1941, following the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of the country]]. On 30 April a pro-German Serbian administration was formed under [[Milan Aćimović]] to serve as a civil administration in the military occupation zone. A joint [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] and [[Chetnik]] uprising in late 1941 became a serious concern for the Germans, as most of their forces were deployed to Russia; only three divisions were in the country. On 13 August 546 Serbs, including some of the country's prominent and influential leaders, issued an appeal to the Serbian nation that condemned the Partisan and royalist resistance as unpatriotic. Two weeks after the appeal, with the Partisan and royalist insurgency beginning to gain momentum, 75 prominent Serbs convened a meeting in Belgrade and formed a [[Government of National Salvation]] under Serbian General [[Milan Nedić]] to replace the existing Serbian administration. The Germans were short of police and military forces in Serbia, and came to rely on poorly armed Serbian formations, the [[Serbian State Guard]] and [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], to maintain order. These forces, however, were not able to contain the resistance, and for the most of the war large parts of Serbia were under control of the Partisans or Chetniks (the two resistance movements soon became mutually-hostile). The Government of National Salvation, imbued with few powers upon formation, saw its functions further decreased and taken over by the [[Wehrmacht]] occupation authorities as the war progressed. After the initial mass revolts, the German authorities instituted an extreme regime of reprisals, proclaiming that 100 civilians would be executed for every German soldier killed, and 50 for each one wounded. These measures were actually implemented on more than one occasion: large-scale shootings took place in the Serbian towns of [[Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac]] during October 1941.

====War justifications====

''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] described Italy's declaration of war against the Western Allies of Britain and France in June 1940 as the following: &quot;We are going to war against the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] and [[reactionary]] [[Democracy|democracies]] of the [[Western world|West]] who have invariably hindered the progress and often threatened the very existence of the [[Italians|Italian people]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Whittam.

Study of Crisis. University of Michigan Press, 1997. P. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy, like Germany, also justified its actions by claiming that Italy needed to territorially expand to provide ''[[spazio vitale]]'' (&quot;vital space&quot;) for the Italian nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rodogno46&quot;&gt;*{{Cite book|first=Davide|last=Rodogno|title=Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War |location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|pages=46–48|isbn=978-0-521-84515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1938 in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement, Italy demanded concessions from France to yield to Italy: a [[List of free ports|free port]] at Djibouti, control of the [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad]], Italian participation in the management of [[Suez Canal Company]], some form of French-Italian [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over Tunisia, and the preservation of Italian culture in French-held Corsica with no French assimilation of the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;H.

Italy justified its [[Greco-Italian War|intervention against Greece in October 1940]] on the allegation that Greece was being used by Britain against Italy, Mussolini informed this to Hitler, saying: &quot;Greece is one of the main points of English maritime strategy in the Mediterranean&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs 1941.

====History====

In the late 19th century, after [[Italian unification]], a [[Italian nationalism|nationalist]] movement had grown around the concept of ''[[Italia irredenta]]'', which advocated the incorporation into Italy of Italian-populated areas still under foreign rule. There was a desire to annex [[Dalmatia]]n territories, which had formerly been ruled by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and which consequently had Italian-speaking elites. The intention of the Fascist regime was to create a &quot;[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]&quot; in which Italy would dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In 1935–1936 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia]] and the Fascist government proclaimed the creation of the &quot;Italian Empire&quot;.{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=289}} Protests by the [[League of Nations]], especially the British, who had interests in that area, led to no serious action, although The League did try to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. In 1937 Italy left the League of Nations and joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which had been signed by Germany and Japan the preceding year. In March/April 1939 Italian troops invaded and annexed [[Albania]]. Germany and Italy signed the [[Pact of Steel]] on May 22.

Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. In September 1940 Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]].

Italy was ill-prepared for war, in spite of the fact that it had continuously been involved in conflict since 1935, first with Ethiopia in 1935–1936 and then in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]].{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40–41}} 
Mussolini refused to heed warnings from his minister of exchange and currency, Felice Guarneri, who said that Italy's actions in Ethiopia and Spain meant that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} By 1939 military expenditures by Britain and France far exceeded what Italy could afford.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} As a result of Italy's economic difficulties its soldiers were poorly paid, often being poorly equipped and poorly supplied, and animosity arose between soldiers and class-conscious officers; these contributed to low morale amongst Italian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel W. Mitcham, Jr.. Rommel's Desert War: The Life and Death of the Afrika Korps. Stackpole Books, 2007. P16.&lt;/ref&gt; Military planning was deficient, as the Italian government had not decided on which theatre would be the most important. Power over the military was overcentralized to Mussolini's direct control; he personally undertook to direct the ministry of war, the navy, and the air force. The navy did not have any aircraft carriers to provide air cover for amphibious assaults in the Mediterranean, as the Fascist regime believed that the air bases on the Italian Peninsula would be able to do this task.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|pp=38–40}} Italy's army had outmoded artillery and the armoured units used outdated formations not suited to modern warfare.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40}} Diversion of funds to the air force and navy to prepare for overseas operations meant less money was available for the army; the standard rifle was a design that dated back to 1891.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} The Fascist government failed to learn from mistakes made in Ethiopia and Spain; it ignored the implications of the Italian Fascist volunteer soldiers being routed at the [[Battle of Guadalajara]] in the Spanish Civil War.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} Military exercises by the army in the [[Po Valley]] in August 1939 disappointed onlookers, including King Victor Emmanuel III.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40}} Mussolini who was angered by Italy's military unpreparedness, dismissed [[Alberto Pariani]] as Chief of Staff of the Italian military in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143&quot;&gt;Neville Wylie. ''European Neutrals and Non-Belligerents during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Pp. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy's only strategic natural resource was an abundance of aluminum. Petroleum, iron, copper, nickel, chrome, and rubber all had to be imported.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40}} The Fascist government's economic policy of [[autarky]] and a recourse to synthetic materials was not able to meet the demand.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40–41}} Prior to entering the war, the Fascist government sought to gain control over resources in the [[Balkans]], particularly oil from [[Romania during World War II|Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville Wylie. ''European Neutrals and Non-Belligerents during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Pp. 142=143.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union to invade and partition Poland between them resulted in Hungary that bordered the Soviet Union after Poland's partition, and Romania viewing Soviet invasion as an immediate threat, resulting in both countries appealing to Italy for support, beginning in September 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143&quot;/&gt; Italy - then still officially neutral - responded to appeals by the Hungarian and Romanian governments for protection from the Soviet Union, by proposing a Danube-Balkan neutrals bloc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143&quot;/&gt; The proposed bloc was designed to increase Italian influence in the Balkans: it met resistance from France, Germany, and the Soviet Union that did not want to lose their influence in the Balkans; however Britain, that still hoped that Italy would not enter the war on Germany's side, supported the neutral bloc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143&quot;/&gt; The efforts to form the bloc failed by November 1939 after [[Turkey]] made an agreement that it would protect Allied Mediterranean territory, along with [[Greece during World War II|Greece]] and Romania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville Wylie 2002. Pp. 143&quot;/&gt;

Initially upon the outbreak of war between Germany and the Allies, Mussolini pursued a non-belligerent role for Italy out of concerns that Germany may not win its war with the Allies. However Mussolini in private grew anxious that Italy not intervening in support of Germany in September 1939 upon Britain and France waging war on Germany, would eventually result in retribution by Germany if Italy did not get involved in the war on Germany's side.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mallett, Gert Sorensen. International Fascism, 1919-45. Routledge, 2002, 2011. P48.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1940, Italy was still a non-belligerent, and Mussolini communicated to Hitler that Italy was not prepared to intervene soon. By March 1940, Mussolini decided that Italy would intervene, but the date was not yet chosen. His senior military leadership unanimously opposed the action because Italy was unprepared. No raw materials had been stockpiled and the reserves it did have would soon be exhausted, Italy's industrial base was only one-tenth of Germany's, and even with supplies the Italian military was not organized to provide the equipment needed to fight a modern war of a long duration. An ambitious rearmament program was impossible because of Italy's limited reserves in gold and foreign currencies and lack of raw materials. Mussolini ignored the negative advice.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. W. Kavanaugh. ''Hitler's Malta Option: A Comparison of the Invasion of Crete (Operation Merkur) and the Proposed Invasion of Malta'' (Nimble Books LLC, 2010). p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 1938 report by German Naval High Command (OKM) warned that Italy as a combatant ally would be a serious &quot;burden&quot; to Germany if a war between Germany and Britain occurred, and recommended that it would be preferable for Germany to seek for Italy to be a &quot;benevolent neutral&quot; during the war. On 18 March 1940, Hitler told Mussolini in person that the war would be over by the summer and that Italy's military involvement was not required.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh, ''Hitler's Malta Option'' p 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini on 29 May 1940 discussed the situation of the Italian Army in which he acknowledged that it was not ideal but believed that it was satisfactory, and discussed the timeline for a declaration of war on Britain and France. He said: &quot;a delay of two weeks or a month would not be an improvement, and Germany could think we entered the war when the risk was very small ... And this could be a burden on us when peace comes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mallett, Gert Sorensen. International Fascism, 1919-45. Routledge, 2002, 2011. P49.&lt;/ref&gt;

After entering the war in 1940, Italy had been slated to be granted a series of territorial concessions from France that Hitler had agreed to with Italian foreign minister Ciano, that included Italian annexation of claimed territories in southeastern France, a military occupation of southeastern France up to the river [[Rhone]], and receiving the French colonies of [[French Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[Djibouti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Aristotle Kallis|Aristotle A. Kallis]] 1945. P. 175&quot;&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis. ''Fascist Ideology: Territory and Expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922–1945'' p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 22 June 1940, Mussolini suddenly informed Hitler that Italy was abandoning its claims &quot;in the Rhone, Corsica, Tunisia, and Djibouti&quot;, instead requesting a demilitarized zone along the French border, and on 24 June Italy agreed to an armistice with the [[Vichy regime]] to that effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Aristotle Kallis|Aristotle A. Kallis]] 1945. P. 175&quot; /&gt; Later on 7 July 1940, the Italian government changed its decision, and Ciano attempted to make an agreement with Hitler to have [[Nice]], Corsica, Tunisia, and Djibouti be transferred to Italy; Hitler adamantly rejected any new settlement or separate French-Italian peace agreement for the time being prior to the defeat of Britain in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Aristotle Kallis|Aristotle A. Kallis]] 1945. P. 175&quot; /&gt; However Italy continued to press Germany for the incorporation of Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia into Italy, with Mussolini sending a letter to Hitler in October 1940, informing him that as the 850,000 Italians living under France's current borders formed the largest minority community, that ceding these territories to Italy would be beneficial to both Germany and Italy as it would reduce France's population from 35 million to 34 and forestall any possibility of resumed French ambitions for expansion or hegemony in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;[[Aristotle Kallis|Aristotle A. Kallis]] 1945. P. 175&quot; /&gt; Germany had considered the possibility of invading and occupying the non-occupied territories of Vichy France including occupying Corsica; Germany capturing the Vichy French fleet for use by Germany, in December 1940 with the proposed [[Operation Attila (World War II)|Operation Attila]].&lt;ref&gt;Deist, Wilhelm; Klaus A. Maier et al. (1990). ''Germany and the Second World War. Oxford University Press''. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of Vichy France by Germany and Italy took place with [[Case Anton]] in November 1942.

In mid-1940, in response to an agreement by Romanian ''Conducător'' [[Ion Antonescu]] to accept German &quot;training troops&quot; to be sent to Romania, both Mussolini and Stalin in the Soviet Union were angered by Germany's expanding sphere of influence into Romania, and especially because neither was informed in advance of the action in spite of German agreements with Italy and the Soviet Union at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs 1941. P. 116&quot;/&gt; Mussolini in a conversation with Ciano responded to Hitler's deployment of troops into Romania, saying: &quot;Hitler always faces me with accomplished facts. Now I'll pay him back by his same currency. He'll learn from the papers that I have occupied Greece. So the balance will be re-established.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs 1941. P. 116&quot;/&gt; However Mussolini later decided to inform Hitler in advance of Italy's designs on Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs 1941. P. 116&quot;/&gt; Upon hearing of Italy's intervention against Greece, Hitler was deeply concerned as he said that the Greeks were not bad soldiers that Italy might not win in its war with Greece, as he did not want Germany to become embroiled in a Balkan conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs 1941. P. 116&quot;/&gt;

By 1941, Italy's attempts to run an autonomous campaign from Germany's, collapsed as a result of military setbacks in Greece, [[North Africa]], and [[Eastern Africa]]; and the country became dependent and effectively subordinate to Germany. After the German-led invasion and occupation of [[Yugoslavia during World War II|Yugoslavia]] and Greece, that had both been targets of Italy's war aims, Italy was forced to accept German dominance in the two occupied countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp284&quot;&gt;Mussolini Unleashed, 1939–1941: Politics and Strategy in Fascist Italy's Last War. Pp.&amp;nbsp;284–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by 1941, German forces in North Africa under [[Erwin Rommel]] effectively took charge of the military effort ousting Allied forces from the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]], and German forces were stationed in [[Sicily]] in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Knight. Mussolini and Fascism. Pp. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany's insolence towards Italy as an ally was demonstrated that year when Italy was pressured to send 350,000 &quot;guest workers&quot; to Germany who were used as forced labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;knight&quot;&gt;Patricia Knight. ''Mussolini and Fascism''. Routledge, 2003. P. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; While Hitler was disappointed with the Italian military's performance, he maintained overall favorable relations with Italy because of his personal friendship with Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2006. P. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini by mid-1941 recognized that Italy's war objectives had failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp284&quot;/&gt; Mussolini henceforth believed that Italy was left with no choice in such a subordinate status other than to follow Germany in its war and hope for a German victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp284&quot;/&gt; However Germany supported Italian propaganda of the creation of a &quot;Latin Bloc&quot; of Italy, [[Vichy France]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] to ally with Germany against the threat of [[communism]], and after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the prospect of a Latin Bloc seemed plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt. Catholic Converts: British and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome. Ithaca, New York, USA: Cornell University, 1997. P. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940 to 1941, [[Francisco Franco]] of Spain had endorsed a Latin Bloc of Italy, Vichy France, Spain and Portugal, in order to balance the countries' powers to that of Germany; however, the discussions failed to yield an agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs&quot;&gt;John Lukacs. ''The Last European War: September 1939-December 1941''. Yale University Press, 2001. P. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, Italy annexed numerous Adriatic islands and a portion of [[Dalmatia]] that was formed into the Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] including territory from the provinces of [[Split (city)|Spalato]], [[Zadar|Zara]], and [[Kotor|Cattaro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davide Rodogno 2006. Pp. 80-81&quot;&gt;Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2006. Pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Italy had initially larger territorial aims that extended from the [[Velebit|Velebit mountains]] to the [[Albanian Alps]], Mussolini decided against annexing further territories due to a number of factors, including that Italy held the economically valuable portion of that territory within its possession while the northern Adriatic coast had no important railways or roads and because a larger annexation would have included hundreds of thousands of Slavs who were hostile to Italy, within its national borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davide Rodogno 2006. Pp. 80-81&quot;/&gt; Mussolini and foreign minister Ciano demanded that the Yugoslav region of [[Slovenia]] to be directly annexed into Italy, however in negotiations with German foreign minister Ribbentrop in April 1941, Ribbentrop insisted on Hitler's demands that Germany be allocated the eastern Slovenia while Italy would be allocated western Slovenia, Italy conceded to this German demand and Slovenia was partitioned between Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2006. P. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the commencing of the Allies' [[Operation Torch]] against Vichy French-held Morocco and Algeria, Germany and Italy intervened in Vichy France and in Vichy French-held Tunisia. Italy seized military control over a significant portion of southern France and Corsica, while a joint German-Italian force seized control over most of Tunisia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Mussolini Warlord: Failed Dreams of Empire, 1940-1943&lt;/ref&gt; When the issue of sovereign control over Tunisia arose from seizure of control by the German-Italian force from Vichy French control, Ribbentrop proclaimed Italian predominance in Tunisia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; However, in spite of Germany's claim to respect Italian predominance, Germans supervised public services and local government in Tunisia, and the German presence was more popular in Tunisia with both the local Arab population and Vichy French collaborators since Germany had no imperial aspirations in Tunisia while Italy did.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

Internal opposition by Italians to the war and the Fascist regime accelerated by 1942, though significant opposition to the war had existed at the outset in 1940, as police reports indicated that many Italians were secretly listening to the [[BBC]] rather than Italian media in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neville.

In spring 1941, Victor Emmanuel III visited Italian soldiers on the front in Yugoslavia and Albania, he was dismayed by the Fascist regime's brutal imperialism in Dalmatia, Slovenia, and Montenegro because he suspected it would impose impossible burdens on Italy by creating new enemies among the occupied peoples that Italy would be forced to fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Denis Mack Smith.

In March 1943, the first sign of serious rebellion by Italians against the Fascist regime and the war began with a strike by factory workers who were joined by soldiers singing communist songs and even rank-in-file Fascist party members.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The Fascist regime also faced passive resistance by civil servants who had begun to refuse to obey orders or pretend to obey orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

On 25 July 1943, King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini, placed him under arrest, and began secret negotiations with the Allies. An [[armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice]] was signed on 8 September 1943, and Italy joined the Allies as a [[Co-belligerence|co-belligerent]]. On 12 September 1943, Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in [[Gran Sasso raid|Operation Oak]] and placed in charge of a puppet state called the [[Italian Social Republic]] (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana''/RSI, or ''Repubblica di Salò'') in [[northern Italy]]. The war went on for months as the Allies, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] and the [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] contended the Social Republic's forces and its German allies. Some areas in Northern Italy were liberated from the Germans as late as May, 1945. Mussolini was killed by Communist partisans on 28 April 1945 while trying to escape to [[Switzerland]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1131}}

Montenegro was an Italian dependency from 1941 to 1943 known as the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Governorate of Montenegro]] that was under the control of an Italian military governor. Initially, the Italians intended that Montenegro would become an &quot;independent&quot; state closely allied with Italy, reinforced through the strong dynastic links between Italy and Montenegro, as [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena of Italy]] was a daughter of the last Montenegrin king [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]]. The Italian-backed Montenegrin nationalist [[Sekula Drljević]] and his followers attempted to create a Montenegrin state. On 12 July 1941, they proclaimed the &quot;Kingdom of Montenegro&quot; under the protection of Italy. In less than 24 hours, that triggered a [[Uprising in Montenegro|general uprising against the Italians]]. Within three weeks, the insurgents managed to capture almost all the territory of Montenegro. Over 70,000 Italian troops and 20,000 of [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Albanian]] and [[Sandžak Muslim militia|Muslim]] irregulars were deployed to suppress the rebellion. Drljevic was expelled from Montenegro in October 1941. Montenegro then came under full direct Italian control. With the Italian capitulation of 1943, Montenegro came directly under the control of Germany.

[[Albanian Kingdom (1939–1943)|Albania]] was an Italian protectorate and dependency from 1939 to 1943. In spite of Albania's long-standing protection and alliance with Italy, on 7 April 1939 Italian troops [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] Albania, five months before the start of the Second World War. Following the invasion, Albania became a protectorate under Italy, with King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy being awarded the crown of Albania. An Italian governor controlled Albania.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies.us&quot;&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/albania/30.htm Albania: A Country Study: Italian Occupation, Library of Congress].

Politically and economically dominated by Italy from its creation in 1913, Albania was occupied by Italian military forces in 1939 as the Albanian king [Zog] fled the country with his family. The Albanian parliament voted to offer the Albanian throne to the King of Italy, resulting in a personal union between the two countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies.us&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/albania/28.htm Albania: A Country Study: Italian Penetration, Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanian army, having been trained by Italian advisors, was reinforced by 100,000 Italian troops. A Fascist militia was organized, drawing its strength principally from Albanians of Italian descent.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Albania served as the staging area for the Italian invasions of Greece and Yugoslavia. Albania annexed Kosovo in 1941 when Yugoslavia was dissolved, creating a Greater Albania.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies.us&quot;/&gt;

Albanian troops were dispatched to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviets as part of the Italian Eighth Army.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Albania declared war on the United States in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[https://worldatwar.net/timeline/other/diplomacy39-45.html ''Timeline Data] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505212551/https://worldatwar.net/timeline/other/diplomacy39-45.html |date=May 5, 2016 }}; World at War online; retrieved 14 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Fascist regime of Italy fell, in September 1943 Albania fell under German occupation.

=====In Africa and Asia=====
[[Italian East Africa]] was an Italian colony existing from 1936 to 1943. Prior to the invasion and annexation of Ethiopia into this united colony in 1936, Italy had two colonies, Eritrea and Somalia since the 1880s.

[[Italian Libya|Libya]] was an Italian colony existing from 1912 to 1943. The northern portion of Libya was incorporated directly into Italy in 1939, however the region remained united as a colony under a colonial governor.

There was also a minor Italian concession territory in Tientsin, Republic of China.

====War justifications====
The Japanese government justified its actions by claiming that it was seeking to unite [[East Asia]] under Japanese leadership in a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] that would free East Asians from domination and rule by clients of Western powers and particularly the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Barak Kushner. The Thought War: Japanese Imperial Propaganda. University of Hawaii Press, P. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan invoked themes of [[Pan-Asianism]] and said that the Asian people needed to be free from Western influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Conroy, Harry Wray. ''Pearl Harbor Reexamined: Prologue to the Pacific War''. University of Hawaii Press, 1990. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States opposed the Japanese war in China, and recognized Chiang Kai-Shek's [[Nationalist Government]] as the legitimate government of China. As a result, the United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a halt by imposing an embargo on all trade between the United States and Japan. Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its [[petroleum]], and as a consequence the embargo resulted in an economic and military crisis for Japan, as Japan could not continue its war effort against China without access to petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;Euan Graham. ''Japan's sea lane security, 1940–2004: a matter of life and death?'' Oxon, England; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2006. Pp. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain its military campaign in China with the major loss of petroleum trade with the United States, Japan saw the best means to secure an alternative source of petroleum in the petroleum-rich and natural-resources-rich [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Marston 2011&quot;&gt;Daniel Marston. ''The Pacific War: From Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima''. Osprey Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This threat of retaliation by Japan to the total trade embargo by the United States was known by the American government, including American Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] who was negotiating with the Japanese to avoid a war, fearing that the total embargo would pre-empt a Japanese attack on the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Conroy, Harry Wray. ''Pearl Harbor Reexamined: Prologue to the Pacific War''. University of Hawaii Press, 1990. P. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan identified the American Pacific fleet based in [[Pearl Harbor Naval Base|Pearl Harbor]] as the principal threat to its designs to invade and capture Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Marston 2011&quot;/&gt; Thus Japan initiated the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 as a means to inhibit an American response to the invasion of Southeast Asia, and buy time to allow Japan to consolidate itself with these resources to engage in a [[total war]] against the United States, and force the United States to accept Japan's acquisitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Marston 2011&quot;/&gt;

====History====
The [[Empire of Japan]], a constitutional monarchy ruled by [[Hirohito]], was the principal Axis power in Asia and the Pacific. Under the emperor were a political cabinet and the [[Imperial General Headquarters]], with two chiefs of staff. By 1945 the Emperor of Japan was more than a symbolic leader; he played a major role in devising a strategy to keep himself on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'' (2001) ch 13&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height, Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] included [[Manchuria]], [[Inner Mongolia]], large parts of [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[French Indochina]], [[Dutch East Indies]], [[The Philippines]], [[Burma]], a small part of India, and various Pacific Islands in the central Pacific.

As a result of the internal discord and economic downturn of the 1920s, militaristic elements set Japan on a path of expansionism. As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's expansionist policies alienated it from other countries in the [[League of Nations]] and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar expansionist policies. Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.

Japan entered into conflict [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against the Chinese]] in 1937. The Japanese invasion and occupation of parts of China resulted in numerous atrocities against civilians, such as the [[Nanking massacre]] and the [[Three Alls Policy]]. The Japanese also [[Soviet–Japanese border conflicts|fought skirmishes]] with Soviet–[[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolian]] forces in [[Manchukuo]] in 1938 and 1939. Japan sought to avoid war with the Soviet Union by signing a non-aggression pact with it in 1941.

Japan's military leaders were divided on diplomatic relationships with Germany and Italy and the attitude towards the United States. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] was in favour of war with the United States, but the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was generally strongly opposed. When [[Prime Minister of Japan]] General [[Hideki Tojo]] refused American demands that Japan withdraw its military forces from China, a confrontation became more likely.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=5}} War with the United States was being discussed within the Japanese government by 1940.{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}} Commander of the Combined Fleet Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] was outspoken in his opposition, especially after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, saying on 14 October 1940: &quot;To fight the United States is like fighting the whole world. But it has been decided. So I will fight the best I can. Doubtless I shall die on board {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} [his flagship]. Meanwhile Tokyo will be burnt to the ground three times. Konoe and others will be torn to pieces by the revengeful people, I [shouldn't] wonder. &quot;{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}} In October and November 1940, Yamamoto communicated with Navy Minister Oikawa, and stated, &quot;Unlike the pre-Tripartite days, great determination is required to make certain that we avoid the danger of going to war. &quot;{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}}

With the European powers focused on the war in Europe, Japan sought to acquire their colonies. In 1940 Japan responded to the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] by occupying [[French Indochina]]. The [[Vichy France]] regime, a ''de facto'' ally of Germany, accepted the takeover. The allied forces did not respond with war. However, the United States instituted an embargo against Japan in 1941 because of the continuing war in China. This cut off Japan's supply of scrap metal and oil needed for industry, trade, and the war effort.

To isolate the US forces stationed in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and to reduce US naval power, the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] ordered [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|an attack]] on the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. They also invaded [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Initially achieving a series of victories, by 1943 the Japanese forces were driven back towards the home islands. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945. The Soviets formally declared war in August 1945 and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|engaged Japanese forces]] in Manchuria and northeast China.

====Colonies and dependencies====
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische jongens tijdens hun soldatentraining door de Japanners TMnr 10001989.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese officers training Indonesian recruits]]
Taiwan, then known as Formosa, had become a Japanese dependency in 1895.

The [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910]] had formally established Korea as a Japanese protectorate and dependency.

The [[South Pacific Mandate]] involved territories mandated to Japan in 1919 in the peace agreements following World War I. The [[League of Nations]] assigned to Japan a mandate over the German islands north of the equator in the Pacific Ocean. Japan received these as a reward for membership in the ranks of the [[Allies of World War I]] - Japan had declared war against Germany and Austria-Hungary in August 1914.

Japan occupied the [[Dutch East Indies]] during World War II. Japan planned to transform these territories into a client state of [[Indonesia]] and sought alliance with Indonesian nationalists including future Indonesian President [[Sukarno]], however these efforts did not result in the formation of an Indonesian state until after Japan's surrender.&lt;ref&gt;

==Minor Axis powers==
In addition to the 3 major Axis powers, 4 more countries and 2 puppet regimes signed the Tri-Partite Pact as its member states. Of the 4 countries, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria participated in various Axis military operations with their national armed forces, while the 4th, Yugoslavia, saw its pro-Nazi government overthrown in a coup merely days after it signed the Pact, and the membership was reversed.

The 2 puppet regimes that signed the Tri-Partite Pact, Tiso-led Slovakia and the Independent State of Croatia are listed among the client states section below.

===Bulgaria===
{{Main article|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}
[[File:Bulgarian army 1941.jpg|thumb|right|Bulgarian soldiers in [[Vardar Macedonia]] during the Balkans campaign]]
The [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was ruled by [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Тsar Boris III]] when it signed the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. Bulgaria had been on the losing side in the First World War and sought a return of lost ethnically and historically Bulgarian territories, specifically in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]] (all within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece]] and [[Turkey]]). During the 1930s, because of traditional right-wing elements, Bulgaria drew closer to Nazi Germany. In 1940 Germany pressured Romania to sign the [[Treaty of Craiova]], returning to Bulgaria the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]], which it had lost in 1913. The Germans also promised Bulgaria — if it joined the Axis — an enlargement of its territory to the borders specified in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]].

Bulgaria participated in the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and Greece by letting German troops attack from its territory and sent troops to Greece on April 20. As a reward, the Axis powers allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of both countries—southern and south-eastern Yugoslavia ([[Vardar Banovina]]) and north-eastern Greece (parts of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Greek Thrace]]). The Bulgarian forces in these areas spent the following years fighting various nationalist groups and [[resistance movement]]s. Despite German pressure, Bulgaria did not take part in the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] and actually never declared war on the Soviet Union. The [[Bulgarian Navy]] was nonetheless involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Bulgarian government declared war on the [[Western Allies]]. This action remained largely symbolic (at least from the Bulgarian perspective), until August 1943, when Bulgarian air defense and air force attacked Allied bombers, returning (heavily damaged) from a mission over the Romanian oil refineries. This turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]] and other major Bulgarian cities, which were heavily bombed by the Allies in the winter of 1943–1944.

On 2 September 1944, as the [[Red Army]] approached the Bulgarian border, a new Bulgarian government came to power and sought peace with the Allies, expelled the few remaining German troops, and declared neutrality. These measures however did not prevent the Soviet Union from declaring war on Bulgaria on 5 September, and on 8 September the Red Army marched into the country, meeting no resistance. This was followed by the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|coup d'état of 9 September 1944]], which brought a government of the pro-Soviet [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] to power. After this, the Bulgarian army (as part of the Red Army's [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]) fought the Germans in Yugoslavia and Hungary, sustaining numerous casualties. Despite this, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] treated Bulgaria as one of the defeated countries. Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but had to give up all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory.

===Hungary===
{{Main article|Hungary during World War II}}
[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|right|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank as used during the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]]
[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|right|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1944]]
[[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], ruled by [[Regent]] Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], was the first country apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, signing the agreement on 20 November 1940. Slovakia had been a client state of Germany since 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Dunn, T.G. Fraser. Europe and Ethnicity: The First World War and Contemporary Ethnic Conflict. Routledge, 1996. P97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political instability plagued the country until Miklós Horthy, a Hungarian nobleman and [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian naval]] officer, became regent in 1920. Hungarian nationalists desired to recover territories lost through the [[Trianon Treaty]]. The country drew closer to Germany and Italy largely because of a shared desire to revise the peace settlements made after World War I.{{sfn|Montgomery|2002|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Many people sympathized with the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] policy of the Nazi regime. Due to its pro-German stance, Hungary received favourable territorial settlements when Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in 1938–1939 and received [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania via the [[Second Vienna Award]] in 1940. Hungarians permitted German troops to transit through their territory during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], and Hungarian forces took part in the invasion. Parts of Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary; the United Kingdom immediately broke off diplomatic relations in response.

Although Hungary did not initially participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Hungary declared war on the Soviet Union on 27 June 1941. Over 500,000 soldiers served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. All five of Hungary's field armies ultimately participated in the war against the Soviet Union; a significant contribution was made by the [[Hungarian Second Army]].

On 25 November 1941, Hungary was one of thirteen signatories to the revived Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian troops, like their Axis counterparts, were involved in numerous actions against the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets had gained the upper hand and the Germans were retreating. The Hungarian Second Army was destroyed in fighting on the [[Voronezh Front]], on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. In 1944, with Soviet troops advancing toward Hungary, Horthy attempted to reach an armistice with the Allies. However, the Germans [[Operation Panzerfaust|replaced the existing regime with a new one]]. After fierce fighting, Budapest was taken by the Soviets. A number of pro-German Hungarians retreated to Italy and Germany, where they fought until the end of the war.

Relations between Germany and the regency of [[Miklós Horthy]] collapsed in Hungary in 1944. Horthy was forced to abdicate after German armed forces held his son hostage as part of [[Operation Panzerfaust]]. Hungary was reorganized following Horthy's abdication in December 1944 into a totalitarian fascist regime called the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]], led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. He had been Prime Minister of Hungary since October 1944 and was leader of the anti-Semitic fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. In power, his government was a puppet regime with little authority, and the country was effectively under German control. Days after the Szálasi government took power, the capital of [[Budapest]] was surrounded by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. German and Hungarian fascist forces tried to hold off the Soviet advance but failed. In March 1945, Szálasi fled to Germany as the leader of a government in exile, until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.

[[File:IAR80.jpg|thumb|right|A formation of Romanian [[IAR80]] fighter aircraft]]

When war erupted in Europe in 1939, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] was pro-British and allied to the [[Polish-Romanian alliance|Poles]]. Following the [[invasion of Poland]] by Germany and the Soviet Union, and the German conquest of France and the [[Low Countries]], Romania found itself increasingly isolated; meanwhile, pro-German and pro-Fascist elements began to grow.

The August 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol ceding [[Bessarabia]], and [[Northern Bukovina]] to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} On June 28, 1940, the Soviet Union [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied and annexed Bessarabia, as well as part of northern Romania]] and the [[Hertza region]].{{sfn|Senn|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} On 30 August 1940, Germany forced Romania to cede [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]]. [[Southern Dobruja]] was ceded to [[Bulgaria]] in September 1940. In an effort to appease the Fascist elements within the country and obtain German protection, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] appointed the General [[Ion Antonescu]] as Prime Minister on September 6, 1940.

Two days later, Antonescu forced the king to abdicate and installed the king's young son [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] (Mihai) on the throne, then declared himself ''Conducător'' (&quot;Leader&quot;) with dictatorial powers. The [[National Legionary State]] was proclaimed on 14 September, with the [[Iron Guard]] ruling together with Antonescu as the sole legal political movement in Romania. Under King Michael I and the military government of Antonescu, Romania signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] on November 23, 1940. German troops entered the country on 10 October 1941, officially to train the Romanian Army. Hitler's directive to the troops on 10 October had stated that &quot;it is necessary to avoid even the slightest semblance of military occupation of Romania&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dinu C. Giurescu, ''Romania in the Second World War (1939–1945)'', p.&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance of German troops in Romania determined Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] to launch an invasion of Greece, starting the [[Greco-Italian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig Stockings, Eleanor Hancock, ''Swastika over the Acropolis: Re-interpreting the Nazi Invasion of Greece in World War II'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Having secured Hitler's approval in January 1941, Antonescu [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|ousted the Iron Guard]] from power.

Romania was subsequently used as a platform for invasions of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Despite not being involved militarily in the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]], Romania requested that Hungarian troops not operate in the [[Banat (1941-1944)|Banat]]. Paulus thus modified the Hungarian plan and kept their troops west of the [[Tisza]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlile Aylmer Macartney, ''October Fifteenth: A History of Modern Hungary, 1929–1945, Volume 1'', p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arms industry in Romania#Weapons produced during World War II and the Interwar period|Romania's military industry]] was small but versatile, able to copy and produce thousands of French and Soviet mortars, hundreds of German [[3.7 cm Flak 18/36/37/43|37 mm anti-aircraft guns]], 200 British [[Vickers Model 1931]] 75&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns, hundreds of French 47&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank guns, thousands of Czechoslovak machine guns and 126 French [[Renault UE Chenillette|Renault UE]] armored tractors. Original products include the [[Orița M1941]] sub-machinegun, the [[75 mm Reșița Model 1943]] anti-tank gun with a muzzle velocity of over 1&amp;nbsp;km/second of which up to 400 were made and about a hundred tank destroyers, the most notable being the [[Mareșal tank destroyer]], which is credited with being the inspiration for the German [[Hetzer]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Zaloga, ''Tanks of Hitler’s Eastern Allies 1941–45'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Romania also built sizable warships, such as the minelayer ''[[NMS Amiral Murgescu|Amiral Murgescu]]'' and the submarines ''[[NMS Rechinul|Rechinul]]'' and ''[[NMS Marsuinul|Marsuinul]]''. Hundreds of originally-designed aircraft were also produced, such as the fighter [[IAR-80]] and the light bomber [[IAR-37]]. Romania had also been a major power in the oil industry since the 1800s. It was one of the largest producers in Europe and the Ploiești oil refineries provided about 30% of all Axis oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rick|title=The Guns at Last Light|date=2013|publisher=Henry Holt|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-6290-8|page=354|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian troops [[Crimean Campaign|fought their way into the Crimea]] alongside German troops and contributed significantly to the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Siege of Sevastopol]]. Later, Romanian mountain troops joined the German campaign in the Caucasus, reaching as far as [[Nalchik]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David T. Zabecki]], ''World War II in Europe: An Encyclopedia'', p. 1421&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering devastating losses [[Romanian armies in the battle of Stalingrad|at Stalingrad]], Romanian officials began secretly negotiating peace conditions with the Allies. By 1943, the tide began to turn. The Soviets pushed further west, retaking Ukraine and eventually launching an [[First Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|unsuccessful invasion]] of eastern Romania in the spring of 1944. Romanian troops in the Crimea [[Kerch-Eltigen Operation|helped repulse initial Soviet landings]], but eventually all of the peninsula was re-conquered by Soviet forces and the [[Romanian Navy]] evacuated over 100,000 German and Romanian troops, an achievement which earned Romanian Admiral Horia Macellariu the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer C. Tucker, ''World War II at Sea: An Encyclopedia'', p. 633&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]] of August 1944, Romania [[King Michael's Coup|switched sides]] on August 23, 1944. Romanian troops then fought alongside the Soviet Army until the end of the war, reaching as far as Czechoslovakia and Austria.

[[File:Phot and Tojo.jpg|thumb|right|Thai Prime Minister [[Phot Phahonyothin]] (far left) with Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō (center) in Tokyo, Japan, 1942]]
[[Thailand]] waged the [[Franco-Thai War]] in October 1940 to May 1941 to reclaim territory from [[French Indochina]]. It became a formal ally of Japan from 25 January 1942.

Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invaded Thailand's territory]] an hour and a half before the attack on Pearl Harbor, (because of the International Dateline, the local time was on the morning of 8 December 1941). Only hours after the invasion, prime minister Field Marshal [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] ordered the cessation of resistance against the Japanese. On 21 December 1941, a military alliance with Japan was signed and on 25 January 1942, [[Sang Phathanothai]] read over the radio Thailand's formal declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The Thai ambassador to the United States, [[Mom Rajawongse]] [[Seni Pramoj]], who was pro-Allies, refused to deliver his copy of the declaration of war. Therefore, although the British reciprocated by declaring war on Thailand and considered it a hostile country, the United States did not.

When Thailand signed the Tripartite Pact on 15 February 1942, the Thais and Japanese also agreed that [[Shan State]] and [[Kayah State]] were to be under Thai control. The rest of Burma was to be under Japanese control. On 10 May 1942, the Thai [[Phayap Army]] entered Burma's eastern Shan State, which had been claimed by Siamese kingdoms. Three Thai infantry and one cavalry division, spearheaded by armoured reconnaissance groups and supported by the air force, engaged the retreating Chinese 93rd Division. [[Kengtung]], the main objective, was captured on 27 May. Renewed offensives in June and November saw the Chinese retreat into [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |title=Thailand and the Second World War |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027105102/http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |archivedate=2009-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area containing the Shan States and Kayah State was annexed by Thailand in 1942. The areas were ceded back to [[Burma]] in 1945.

The [[Free Thai Movement]] (&quot;Seri Thai&quot;) was established during these first few months. Parallel Free Thai organizations were also established in the United Kingdom. Queen [[Ramphaiphanni]] was the nominal head of the British-based organization, and [[Pridi Phanomyong]], the regent, headed its largest contingent, which was operating within Thailand. Aided by elements of the military, secret airfields and training camps were established, while [[Office of Strategic Services]] and [[Force 136]] agents slipped in and out of the country.

As the war dragged on, the Thai population came to resent the Japanese presence. In June 1944, Phibun was overthrown in a coup d'état. The new civilian government under [[Khuang Aphaiwong]] attempted to aid the resistance while maintaining cordial relations with the Japanese. After the war, U. S. influence prevented Thailand from being treated as an Axis country, but the British demanded three million tons of rice as reparations and the return of areas annexed from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] during the war. Thailand also returned the portions of British Burma and French Indochina that had been annexed. Phibun and a number of his associates were put on trial on charges of having committed war crimes and of collaborating with the Axis powers. However, the charges were dropped due to intense public pressure. Public opinion was favourable to Phibun, since he was thought to have done his best to protect Thai interests.

===Yugoslavia: membership lasts two days===
{{main article|Axis–Yugoslav Pact|Yugoslav coup d'état|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}

In February 1941, Hitler called for Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact. In March, the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border. On 25 March 1941, fearing that Yugoslavia would be invaded otherwise, the Yugoslav government signed the Tripartite Pact with significant reservations. Unlike other Axis powers, Yugoslavia was not obliged to provide military assistance, nor to provide its territory for Axis to move military forces during the war. Less than two days later, after demonstrations in the streets of Belgrade, Prince Paul and the government were removed from office by a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]]. Seventeen-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under General [[Dušan Simović]], refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and Soviet Union. Winston Churchill commented that &quot;Yugoslavia has found its soul&quot;.  However Hitler invaded and quickly took control.

==Co-belligerent state combatants==
Various countries fought side by side with the Axis powers for a common cause. These countries were not signatories of the Tripartite Pact and thus not formal members of the Axis.

===Finland===

{{Main article|Military history of Finland during World War II}}

Although Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact and legally ''(de jure)'' was not a part of the Axis, it was Axis-aligned in its fight against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=134}} Finland signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact of November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Forster, &quot;Finland's Foreign Policy 1940-1941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy,&quot; ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp 109-123&lt;/ref&gt;

The August 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}}{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=120}} After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland in November 1939 during the [[Winter War]], intending to establish a communist puppet government in Finland.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|pp=120–121}}{{sfn|Kennedy-Pipe|1995|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The conflict threatened Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=123}} Despite Finnish resistance, a peace treaty was signed in March 1940, wherein Finland ceded some key territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]]. After this war, Finland sought protection and support from the United Kingdom{{sfn|Seppinen|1983|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}&lt;ref name=&quot;FOFinland&quot;&gt;British Foreign Office Archive, 371/24809/461-556.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-aligned Sweden,{{sfn|Jokipii|1987|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} but was thwarted by Soviet and German actions. This resulted in Finland being drawn closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories.

In the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Finland permitted German planes returning from mine dropping runs over [[Kronstadt]] and [[Neva River]] to refuel at Finnish airfields before returning to bases in [[East Prussia]]. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launched a major air offensive against Finnish airfields and towns, which resulted in a Finnish declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. The Finnish conflict with the Soviet Union is generally referred to as the [[Continuation War]].

[[File:Hitler Mannerheim 2.jpg|upright|thumb|Mannerheim with Hitler]]

Finland's main objective was to regain territory lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War. However, on 10 July 1941, Field Marshal [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] issued an [[Order of the Day]] that contained a formulation understood internationally as a Finnish territorial interest in Russian [[Karelia]].

Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Finland were severed on 1 August 1941, after the British bombed German forces in the Finnish village and port of [[Pechenga (urban-type settlement), Murmansk Oblast|Petsamo]]. The United Kingdom repeatedly called on Finland to cease its offensive against the Soviet Union, and declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]].
[[File:Tali-Ihantala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish troops passing by the remains of a destroyed Soviet T-34 at the [[battle of Tali-Ihantala]]]]
Finland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during [[Operation Silverfox]], a joint offensive against Murmansk. Finland refused German requests to participate actively in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and also granted asylum to Jews, while Jewish soldiers continued to serve in its army.

The relationship between Finland and Germany more closely resembled an alliance during the six weeks of the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was presented as a German condition for help with munitions and air support, as the [[Fourth strategic offensive|Soviet offensive coordinated with D-Day]] threatened Finland with complete occupation. The agreement, signed by President [[Risto Ryti]] but never ratified by the Finnish Parliament, bound Finland not to seek a separate peace.

After Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, Ryti's successor as president, Marshall Mannerheim, dismissed the agreement and opened secret negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in a ceasefire on 4 September and the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. Under the terms of the armistice, Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947.

===Iraq===
[[File:Destroyed iraqi artillery.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] officer investigates wrecked Iraqi artillery near [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]].]]
The [[Kingdom of Iraq]] was briefly an ally of the Axis, fighting the United Kingdom in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] of May 1941.

Anti-British sentiments were widespread in Iraq prior to 1941. Seizing power on 1 April 1941, the nationalist government of [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Rashid Ali]] repudiated the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930]] and demanded that the British abandon their military bases and withdraw from the country. Ali sought support from Germany and Italy in expelling British forces from Iraq.

On 9 May 1941, [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the [[Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]] and associate of Ali, declared holy war{{sfn|Jabārah|1985|p=183}} against the British and called on Arabs throughout the Middle East to rise up against British rule. On 25 May 1941, the Germans stepped up offensive operations in the Middle East.

Hitler issued [[Führer Directive No. 30|Order 30]]: &quot;The Arab Freedom Movement in the Middle East is our natural ally against England. In this connection special importance is attached to the liberation of Iraq&amp;nbsp;... I have therefore decided to move forward in the Middle East by supporting Iraq. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston (1950). The Second World War, Volume III, The Grand Alliance. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, p.234; [[Franz Kurowski|Kurowski, Franz]] (2005). The Brandenburger Commandos: Germany's Elite Warrior Spies in World War II. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Book. ISBN 978-0-8117-3250-5, 10: 0-8117-3250-9. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostilities between the Iraqi and British forces began on 2 May 1941, with heavy fighting at [[RAF Habbaniya|the RAF air base]] in [[Habbaniyah]]. The Germans and Italians dispatched aircraft and aircrew to Iraq utilizing Vichy French bases in Syria, which would later invoke fighting between [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Allied and Vichy French forces in Syria]].

The Germans planned to coordinate a combined German-Italian offensive against the British in Egypt, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Iraq. Iraqi military resistance ended by 31 May 1941. Rashid Ali and the Mufti of Jerusalem fled to Iran, then Turkey, Italy, and finally Germany, where Ali was welcomed by Hitler as head of the Iraqi [[government-in-exile]] in Berlin. In propaganda broadcasts from Berlin, the Mufti continued to call on Arabs to rise up against the British and aid German and Italian forces. He also helped recruit [[Muslim]] volunteers in the Balkans for the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.

==Client states==
&lt;!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. --&gt;
{{further information|Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere}}

===Japanese===
The Empire of Japan created a number of client states in the areas occupied by its military, beginning with the creation of Manchukuo in 1932. These puppet states achieved varying degrees of international recognition.

====Burma (Ba Maw regime)====
{{Main article|Japanese occupation of Burma}}

The Japanese Army and Burma nationalists, led by [[Aung San]], seized control of Burma from the United Kingdom during 1942. A [[State of Burma]] was formed on 1 August under the Burmese nationalist leader [[Ba Maw]]. The Ba Maw regime established the Burma Defence Army (later renamed the [[Burma National Army]]), which was commanded by [[Aung San]].

====Cambodia====
The [[Colonial Cambodia#Emergence of Khmer nationalism|Kingdom of Cambodia]] was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 9 March 1945 to 15 August 1945.

The Japanese entered Cambodia in mid-1941, but allowed Vichy French officials to remain in administrative posts. The Japanese calls for an &quot;Asia for the Asiatics&quot; won over many Cambodian nationalists.

This policy changed during the last months of the war. The Japanese wanted to gain local support, so they dissolved French colonial rule and pressured Cambodia to declare its independence within the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Four days later, King [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]] declared Kampuchea (the original [[Khmer language|Khmer]] pronunciation of Cambodia) independent. Co-editor of the ''Nagaravatta'', [[Son Ngoc Thanh]], returned from Tokyo in May and was appointed foreign minister.

On the date of Japanese surrender, a new government was proclaimed with Son Ngoc Thanh as prime minister. When the Allies occupied [[Phnom Penh]] in October, Son Ngoc Thanh was arrested for collaborating with the Japanese and was exiled to France. Some of his supporters went to northwestern Cambodia, which had been under Thai control since the [[French-Thai War]] of 1940, where they banded together as one faction in the [[Khmer Issarak]] movement, originally formed with Thai encouragement in the 1940s.

====China (Reorganized National Government of China)====
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Japan advanced from its bases in Manchuria to occupy much of East and Central China. Several Japanese puppet states were organized in areas occupied by the Japanese Army, including the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] at [[Beijing]], which was formed in 1937, and the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] at Nanjing, which was formed in 1938. These governments were merged into the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] at Nanjing on 29 March 1940. [[Wang Jingwei]] became head of state. The government was to be run along the same lines as the Nationalist regime and adopted its symbols.

The Nanjing Government had no real power; its main role was to act as a propaganda tool for the Japanese. The Nanjing Government concluded agreements with Japan and Manchukuo, authorising Japanese occupation of China and recognising the independence of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. The Nanjing Government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 9 January 1943.

The government had a strained relationship with the Japanese from the beginning. Wang's insistence on his regime being the true Nationalist government of China and in replicating all the symbols of the [[Kuomintang]] led to frequent conflicts with the Japanese, the most prominent being the issue of the regime's flag, which was identical to that of the [[Republic of China]].

The worsening situation for Japan from 1943 onwards meant that the Nanking Army was given a more substantial role in the defence of occupied China than the Japanese had initially envisaged. The army was almost continuously employed against the communist [[New Fourth Army]].

Wang Jingwei died on 10 November 1944, and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Chen Gongbo]]. Chen had little influence; the real power behind the regime was [[Zhou Fohai]], the mayor of Shanghai. Wang's death dispelled what little legitimacy the regime had. The state stuttered on for another year and continued the display and show of a fascist regime.

On 9 September 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the area was surrendered to General [[He Yingqin]], a nationalist general loyal to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The Nanking Army generals quickly declared their alliance to the Generalissimo, and were subsequently ordered to resist Communist attempts to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender. Chen Gongbo was tried and executed in 1946.

====India (Provisional Government of Free India)====
{{Main article|Azad Hind Fauj|Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind}}
[[File:INA Jubilation.jpg|thumb|right|[[Indian National Army]] soldiers in Asia]]

The ''Arzi Hukumat-e-[[Azad Hind]]'', the Provisional Government of Free India was a state that was recognized by nine Axis governments. It was led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], an [[Indian nationalist]] who rejected [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s nonviolent methods for achieving independence. The [[First INA]] faltered after its leadership objected to being a propaganda tool for Japanese war aims, and the role of [[I Kikan]]. It was revived by the [[Indian Independence League]] with Japanese support in 1942 after the ex-PoWs and Indian civilians in South-east Asia agreed to participate in the INA venture on the condition it was led by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Bose declared India's independence on October 21, 1943. The Indian National Army was committed as a part of the [[U Go Offensive]]. It played a largely marginal role in the battle, and suffered serious casualties and had to withdraw with the rest of Japanese forces after the [[Battle of Imphal|siege of Imphal]] was broken. It was later committed to the defence of Burma [[Burma Campaign 1944–45|against the Allied offensive]]. It suffered a large number of desertions in this latter part. The remaining troops of the INA maintained order in Rangoon after the withdrawal of Ba Maw's government withdrew. although The provisional government was given nominal control of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] from November 1943 to August 1945.

====Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang)====
[[Mengjiang]] was a Japanese puppet state in [[Inner Mongolia]]. It was nominally ruled by Prince [[Demchugdongrub]], a [[Mongol]] nobleman descended from [[Genghis Khan]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military. Mengjiang's independence was proclaimed on 18 February 1936, following the Japanese occupation of the region.

The Inner Mongolians had several grievances against the central Chinese government in Nanking, including their policy of allowing unlimited migration of Han Chinese to the region. Several of the young princes of Inner Mongolia began to agitate for greater freedom from the central government, and it was through these men that Japanese saw their best chance of exploiting Pan-Mongol nationalism and eventually seizing control of Outer Mongolia from the Soviet Union.

Japan created Mengjiang to exploit tensions between ethnic Mongolians and the central government of China, which in theory ruled Inner Mongolia. When the various puppet governments of China were unified under the [[Wang Jingwei]] government in March 1940, Mengjiang retained its separate identity as an autonomous federation. Although under the firm control of the Japanese Imperial Army, which occupied its territory, Prince Demchugdongrub had his own independent army.

Mengjiang vanished in 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II. As Soviet forces advanced into Inner Mongolia, they met limited resistance from small detachments of Mongolian cavalry, which, like the rest of the army, were quickly overwhelmed.

====Laos====
Fears of Thai irredentism led to the formation of the first Lao nationalist organization, the Movement for National Renovation, in January 1941. The group was led by Prince [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa|Phetxarāt]] and supported by local French officials, though not by the Vichy authorities in [[Hanoi]]. This group wrote the current [[Pheng Xat Lao|Lao national anthem]] and designed the current [[Flag of Laos|Lao flag]], while paradoxically pledging support for France. The country declared its independence in 1945.

The liberation of France in 1944, bringing [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power, meant the end of the alliance between Japan and the Vichy French administration in Indochina. The Japanese had no intention of allowing the [[Gaullist]]s to take over, and in March 1945 they staged a military coup in Hanoi. Some French units fled over the mountains to Laos, pursued by the Japanese, who occupied [[Vientiane|Viang Chan]] in March 1945 and [[Luang Prabang|Luang Phrabāng]] in April. King [[Sisavang Vong|Sīsavāngvong]] was detained by the Japanese, but his son Crown Prince [[Savang Vatthana|Savāngvatthanā]] called on all [[Lao people|Lao]] to assist the French, and many Lao died fighting against the Japanese occupiers.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Prince Phetxarāt opposed this position. He thought that Lao independence could be gained by siding with the Japanese, who made him Prime Minister of Luang Phrabāng, though not of Laos as a whole. The country was in chaos, and Phetxarāt's government had no real authority. Another Lao group, the Lao Sēri (Free Lao), received unofficial support from the Free Thai movement in the [[Isan]] region.

====Manchuria (Manchukuo)====
{{Main article|Manchukuo}}
[[File:Military exercise of Manchukuo Imperial Army.JPG|thumb|right|Manchurian soldiers training in a military exercise]]
[[File:Manchukuo Air Force.JPG|thumb|right|Manchurian pilots of the Manchukuo Air Force]]
Manchukuo, in the northeast region of China, had been a Japanese puppet state in [[Manchuria]] since the 1930s. It was nominally ruled by [[Puyi]], the last emperor of the [[Qing Dynasty]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military, in particular the [[Kwantung Army]]. While Manchukuo ostensibly was a state for ethnic [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the region had a [[Han Chinese]] majority.

Following the [[Mukden Incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, the independence of Manchukuo was proclaimed on 18 February 1932, with Puyi as head of state. He was proclaimed the Emperor of Manchukuo a year later. The new Manchu nation was recognized by 23 of the [[League of Nations]]' 80 members. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were among the major powers who recognised Manchukuo. Other countries who recognized the State were the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Vatican City]]. Manchukuo was also recognised by the other Japanese allies and puppet states, including Mengjiang, the Burmese government of [[Ba Maw]], [[Thailand]], the Wang Jingwei regime, and the Indian government of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The League of Nations later declared in 1934 that Manchuria lawfully remained a part of China. This precipitated Japanese withdrawal from the League. The Manchukuoan state ceased to exist after the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in 1945.

====Philippines (Second Republic)====
{{main article|Japanese occupation of the Philippines}}
After the [[Battle of Bataan#The Fall of Bataan|surrender]] of the Filipino and American forces in [[Bataan Peninsula]] and [[Corregidor Island]], the Japanese established a puppet state in the Philippines in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillermo |first=Artemio R. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 March 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7246-2 |pages=211, 621}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|Philippine National Assembly]] declared the Philippines an [[Second Philippine Republic|independent Republic]] and elected [[José P.

He was granted amnesty by President [[Manuel Roxas]], and remained active in politics, ultimately winning a seat in the post-war [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]].

====Vietnam (Empire of Vietnam)====
The [[Empire of Vietnam]] was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 11 March to 23 August 1945.

When the Japanese seized control of [[French Indochina]], they allowed Vichy French administrators to remain in nominal control. This French rule ended on 9 March 1945, when the Japanese officially took control of the government. Soon after, Emperor [[Bảo Đại]] voided the 1884 treaty with France and [[Trần Trọng Kim]], a historian, became prime minister.

The state suffered through the [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]] and replaced [[French language|French-speaking]] schools with [[Vietnamese language]] schools, taught by Vietnamese scholars.

===Italian===
&lt;!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. --&gt;
Italy occupied several nations and set up clients in those regions to carry out administrative tasks and maintain order.

====Monaco====
The [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] was officially neutral during the war. The population of the country was largely of Italian descent and sympathized with Italy. Its prince was a close friend of the Vichy French leader, Marshal Philippe Pétain, an Axis collaborator. A fascist regime was established under the nominal rule of the prince when the Italian Fourth Army occupied the country on November 10, 1942 as a part of [[Case Anton]]. Monaco's military forces, consisting primarily of police and palace guards, collaborated with the Italians during the occupation. German troops occupied Monaco in 1943, and Monaco was liberated by Allied forces in 1944.

===German===
&lt;!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. --&gt;
The collaborationist administrations of German-occupied countries in Europe had varying degrees of autonomy, and not all of them qualified as fully recognized [[sovereign state]]s. The [[General Government]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]] was a German administration, not a Polish government. In [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]], the [[Quisling regime|National Government]] headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]] – whose name [[Quisling|came to symbolize pro-Axis collaboration]] in several languages – was subordinate to the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]. It was never allowed to have any armed forces, be a recognized military partner, or have autonomy of any kind. In [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|the occupied Netherlands]], [[Anton Mussert]] was given the symbolic title of &quot;Führer of the Netherlands' people&quot;. His [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|National Socialist Movement]] formed a cabinet assisting the German administration, but was never recognized as a real Dutch government. The following list of German client states includes only those entities that were officially considered to be independent countries allied with Germany. They were under varying degrees of German influence and control, but were not ruled directly by Germans.

====Albania (under German control)====
{{Main article|Albanian Kingdom (1943–1944)}}

After the Italian armistice, a vacuum of power opened up in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]]. The Italian occupying forces were rendered largely powerless, as the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] took control of the south and the National Front ([[Balli Kombëtar]]) took control of the north. Albanians in the Italian army joined the guerrilla forces. In September 1943 the guerrillas moved to take the capital of [[Tirana]], but German paratroopers dropped into the city. Soon after the battle, the German High Command announced that they would recognize the independence of a [[greater Albania]]. They organized an Albanian government, police, and military in collaboration with the Balli Kombëtar. The Germans did not exert heavy control over Albania's administration, but instead attempted to gain popular appeal by giving their political partners what they wanted. Several Balli Kombëtar leaders held positions in the regime. The joint forces incorporated Kosovo, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, and Presevo into the Albanian state. A High Council of Regency was created to carry out the functions of a head of state, while the government was headed mainly by Albanian conservative politicians. Albania was the only European country occupied by the Axis powers that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the war.{{sfn|Sarner|1997|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The Albanian government had refused to hand over their Jewish population. They provided Jewish families with forged documents and helped them disperse in the Albanian population.&lt;ref name = &quot;Yad Vashem: Albania&quot;&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem. org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205725.pdf Shoah Research Center – Albania]&lt;/ref&gt; Albania was completely liberated on November 29, 1944.

====Italy (Italian Social Republic)====
{{Main article|Italian Social Republic}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-311-0926-07, Italien, italienische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|right|RSI (Repubblica Sociale Italiana) soldiers, March 1944]] 
Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] formed the Italian Social Republic (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) on 23 September 1943, succeeding the Kingdom of Italy as a member of the Axis.

Mussolini had been removed from office and arrested by King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July 1943. After the Italian armistice, in a [[Gran Sasso raid|raid]] led by German paratrooper [[Otto Skorzeny]], Mussolini was rescued from arrest.

Once restored to power, Mussolini declared that Italy was a [[republic]] and that he was the new head of state. He was subject to German control for the duration of the war.

====Slovakia (Tiso regime)====
{{See also|Slovak invasion of Poland (1939)}}
[[File:Slovakia1941 02.png|thumb|Slovakia in 1941]]
The [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]] under President [[Josef Tiso]] signed the Tripartite Pact on 24 November 1940.

Slovakia had been closely aligned with Germany almost immediately from its declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939. Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection with Germany on 23 March 1939.

Slovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in [[Spiš]] and [[Orava (region)|Orava]]. Those two regions, along with [[Cieszyn Silesia]], had been [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts|disputed]] between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918. The Poles fully annexed them following the [[Munich Agreement]]. After the invasion of Poland, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.
[[File:Andrzeja Olejko Słowackie epizody z polskiego Podkarpacia Sanok 39.jpg|thumb|right|Slovak troops led by General [[Ferdinand Čatloš]] (center) pose with a statue of [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] in [[Sanok]] during the Invasion of Poland.]]
Slovakia invaded Poland alongside German forces, contributing 50,000 men at this stage of the war.

Slovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, furnishing Germany with two divisions totaling 80,000 men. Slovakia declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in 1942.

Slovakia was spared German military occupation until the [[Slovak National Uprising]], which began on 29 August 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso.

After the war, Tiso was executed and Slovakia once again became part of Czechoslovakia. The border with Poland was shifted back to the pre-war state. Slovakia and the Czech Republic finally separated into independent states in 1993.

====Croatia (Independent State of Croatia)====
{{Main article|Independent State of Croatia}}
{{Distinguish|Federal State of Croatia}}
[[File:Adolf Hitler meets Ante Pavelić.1941.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adolf Hitler]] meeting with NDH leader [[Ante Pavelić]].]]
On 10 April 1941, the Independent State of Croatia (''Nezavisna Država Hrvatska'', or NDH) declared itself a member of the Axis, co-signing the Tripartite Pact. The NDH remained a member of the Axis until the end of Second World War, its forces fighting for Germany even after its territory had been overrun by [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. On 16 April 1941, [[Ante Pavelić]], a Croatian nationalist and one of the founders of the [[Ustaše]] (''&quot;Croatian Liberation Movement&quot;''), was proclaimed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of the new regime.

Initially the Ustaše had been heavily influenced by Italy. They were actively supported by Mussolini's Fascist regime in Italy, which gave the movement training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia, as well as accepting Pavelić as an exile and allowing him to reside in Rome. Italy intended to use the movement to destroy Yugoslavia, which would allow Italy to expand its power through the Adriatic. Hitler did not want to engage in a war in the Balkans until the Soviet Union was defeated. The Italian occupation of Greece was not going well; Mussolini wanted Germany to invade Yugoslavia to save the Italian forces in Greece. Hitler reluctantly agreed; Yugoslavia was invaded and the Independent State of Croatia was created. Pavelić led a delegation to Rome and offered the crown of Croatia to an Italian prince of the House of Savoy, who was crowned ''[[Tomislav II]], King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, [[Tuzla]] and Knin, Prince of [[Cisterna]] and of Belriguardo, Marquess of [[Voghera]], and Count of [[Ponderano]].'' The next day, Pavelić signed the Contracts of Rome with Mussolini, ceding Dalmatia to Italy and fixing the permanent borders between the NDH and Italy. Italian armed forces were allowed to control all of the coastline of the NDH, effectively giving Italy total control of the Adriatic coastline.

However, strong German influence began to be asserted soon after the NDH was founded. When the King of Italy ousted Mussolini from power and Italy capitulated, the NDH became completely under German influence.

The platform of the Ustaše movement proclaimed that Croatians had been oppressed by the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that Croatians deserved to have an independent nation after years of domination by foreign empires. The Ustaše perceived Serbs to be racially inferior to Croats and saw them as infiltrators who were occupying Croatian lands. They saw the extermination of Serbs as necessary to racially purify Croatia. While part of Yugoslavia, many Croatian nationalists violently opposed the Serb-dominated Yugoslav monarchy, and assassinated [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], together with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]. The regime enjoyed support amongst radical Croatian nationalists. Ustashe forces fought against communist Yugoslav Partisan guerrilla throughout the war.

Upon coming to power, Pavelić formed the Croatian Home Guard (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo'') as the official military force of the NDH. Originally authorized at 16,000 men, it grew to a peak fighting force of 130,000. The Croatian Home Guard included an air force and navy, although its navy was restricted in size by the Contracts of Rome. In addition to the Croatian Home Guard, Pavelić was also the supreme commander of the [[Ustaše militia]], although all NDH military units were generally under the command of the German or Italian formations in their area of operations.

The Ustaše government declared war on the Soviet Union, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941, and sent troops to Germany's Eastern Front. Ustaše militia were garrisoned in the Balkans, battling the communist partisans.

The Ustaše government applied racial laws on Serbs, Jews, and [[Romani people]], and after June 1941 deported them to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] or to German camps in Poland. The racial laws were enforced by the Ustaše militia. The exact number of victims of the Ustaše regime is uncertain due to the destruction of documents and varying numbers given by historians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH.&lt;ref name=&quot;US Holocaust Memorial Museum&quot;&gt;[https://wayback.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 Jasenovac] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ustaše never had widespread support among the population of the NDH. Their own estimates put the number of sympathizers, even in the early phase, at around 40,000 out of total population of 7 million. However, they were able to rely on the passive acceptance of much of the Croat population of the NDH.

====Greece====
{{Main article|Axis occupation of Greece}}
[[File:Greece Prefectures 1941-44.png|thumb|Greece, 1941–1944]]
Following the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]] of Greece and the flight of the [[Greek government in exile|Greek government]] to Crete and then Egypt, the [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|Hellenic State]] was formed in May 1941 as a puppet state of both Italy and Germany. Initially, Italy had wished to annex Greece, but was pressured by Germany to avoid civil unrest such as had occurred in Bulgarian-annexed areas. The result was Italy accepting the creation of a puppet regime with the support of Germany. Italy had been assured by Hitler of a primary role in Greece. Most of the country was held by Italian forces, but strategic locations ([[Central Macedonia]], the islands of the northeastern Aegean, most of [[Crete]], and parts of [[Attica]]) were held by the Germans, who seized most of the country's economic assets and effectively controlled the collaborationist government. The puppet regime never commanded any real authority, and did not gain the allegiance of the people. It was somewhat successful in preventing secessionist movements like the [[Vlach &quot;Roman Legion&quot;]] from establishing themselves. By mid-1943, the [[Greek Resistance]] had liberated large parts of the mountainous interior (&quot;Free Greece&quot;), setting up a separate administration there. After the Italian armistice, the Italian occupation zone was taken over by the German armed forces, who remained in charge of the country until their withdrawal in autumn 1944. In some Aegean islands, German garrisons were left behind, and surrendered only after the end of the war.

States listed in this section were not officially members of the Axis, but at some point during the war engaged in cooperation with one or more Axis members on level that makes their neutrality disputable.

===Denmark===
{{Main article|Occupation of Denmark }}
[[File:Flag of Denmark.svg|thumb|right|[[Kingdom of Denmark]]]]
Denmark was occupied by Germany after April 1940 but never joined the Axis. On 31 May 1939, Denmark and Germany signed a treaty of non-aggression, which did not contain any military obligations for either party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalhistory.dk/Danish/Historien/1939_1945/IkkeAngrebsPagt.htm &quot;Den Dansk-Tyske Ikke-Angrebstraktat af 1939&quot;]. Flådens Historie. {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, Germany [[Operation Weserübung|attacked Scandinavia]], and the speed of the German invasion of Denmark prevented King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and the Danish government from going into exile. They had to accept &quot;protection by the Reich&quot; and the stationing of German forces in exchange for nominal independence. Denmark coordinated its foreign policy with Germany, extending diplomatic recognition to Axis collaborator and puppet regimes, and breaking diplomatic relations with the Allied governments-in-exile. Denmark broke diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trommer&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Trommer, Aage | title=&quot;Denmark&quot;.

In 1941 Danish Nazis set up the ''[[Frikorps Danmark]]''. Thousands of volunteers fought and many died as part of the German Army on the Eastern Front. Denmark sold agricultural and industrial products to Germany and made loans for armaments and fortifications. The German presence in Denmark, including the construction of the Danish paid for part of the [[Atlantic Wall]] fortifications and was never reimbursed.

The Danish protectorate government lasted until 29 August 1943, when the cabinet resigned after the [[Danish Folketing election, 1943|regularly scheduled and largely free]] election concluding the [[Folketing]]'s current term. The Germans imposed [[martial law]], and Danish collaboration continued on an administrative level, with the Danish bureaucracy functioning under [[military occupation|German command]]. The [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish navy]] scuttled 32 of its larger ships; Germany seized 64 ships and later raised and refitted 15 of the sunken vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005449 Søværnets mærkedage – August&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Historien/1939_1945/dk_efter29august.htm Flåden efter 29 August 1943]&lt;/ref&gt; 13 warships escaped to Sweden and formed a Danish naval flotilla in exile.

===Soviet Union===

{{See also|Germany–Soviet Union relations before 1941|German–Soviet Axis talks|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-121-0011-20, Polen, deutsch-sowjetische Siegesparade.jpg|thumb|upright|German and Soviet soldiers during the official transfer of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] to Soviet control in front of picture of Stalin, in the aftermath of the invasion and [[Partitions of Poland#&quot;Fourth Partition&quot;|partition of Poland]] by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939.]]

Relations between the Soviet Union and the major Axis powers were generally hostile before 1938. In the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Soviet Union gave military aid to the [[Second Spanish Republic]], against [[Spanish State|Spanish Nationalist]] forces, which were assisted by Germany and Italy. However, the Nationalist forces were victorious. The Soviets suffered another political defeat when their ally Czechoslovakia was partitioned and taken over by Germany in 1938–39. In 1938 and 1939, the USSR fought and defeated Japan in two separate border conflicts, at [[Battle of Lake Khasan|Lake Khasan]] and [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]]. The latter was a major Soviet victory that led the Japanese Army to avoid war with the Soviets and instead call for expansion south.

In 1939 the Soviet Union considered forming an alliance with either [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Britain and France]] or with Germany.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=112–120}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=495–496}} When negotiations with Britain and France failed, they turned to Germany and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Germany was now freed from the risk of war with the Soviets, and was assured a supply of oil. This included a secret protocol whereby the independent countries of Finland, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], Poland, and Romania were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} The Soviet Union had been forced to cede Western [[Belarus]] and Western [[Ukraine]] to Poland after losing the [[Soviet-Polish War]] of 1919–1921, and the Soviet Union sought to regain those territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eastern Europe 2004, Pp. 138-139&quot;/&gt;

On 1 September, barely a week after the pact had been signed, [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Germany invaded Poland]]. The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland from the east]] on 17 September and on 28 September signed a secret treaty with Nazi Germany to arrange coordination of fighting against Polish resistance. The Soviets targeted intelligence, entrepreneurs, and officers, committing a string of atrocities that culminated in the [[Katyn massacre]] and mass relocation to the [[Gulag]] in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/nazsov.asp Avalon Project - Nazi-Soviet Relations 1939-1941&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|occupied the Baltic countries]] of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,{{sfn|Senn|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}{{sfn|Wettig|2008|pp=20–21}} and annexed [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina|Northern Bukovina]] from Romania. The Soviet Union attacked Finland on 30 November 1939, which started the [[Winter War]].{{sfn|Kennedy-Pipe|1995|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Finnish defences prevented an all-out invasion, resulting in an [[Moscow Peace Treaty|interim peace]], but Finland was forced to cede strategically important border areas near [[Leningrad]].

The Soviet Union provided material support to Germany in the war effort against Western Europe through a pair of commercial agreements, [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|the first]] in 1939 and [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|the second]] in 1940, which involved exports of raw materials ([[phosphates]], [[chromium]] and [[iron ore]], [[mineral oil]], grain, cotton, and rubber). These and other export goods transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories allowed Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade.

In October and November 1940, [[German–Soviet Axis talks|German-Soviet talks]] about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=58}}{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341–343}} [[Joseph Stalin]] later personally countered with a separate proposal in a letter on 25 November that contained several secret protocols, including that &quot;the area south of [[Batum]] and [[Baku]] in the general direction of the [[Persian Gulf]] is recognized as the center of aspirations of the Soviet Union&quot;, referring to an area approximating present day Iraq and Iran, and a Soviet claim to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341–343}}{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}} Hitler never responded to Stalin's letter.{{sfn|Donaldson|Nogee|2005|pp=65–66}}{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=520–521}} Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=59}}

Germany ended the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} That resulted in the Soviet Union becoming one of the main members of [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].

Germany then revived its Anti-Comintern Pact, enlisting many European and Asian countries in opposition to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Japan remained neutral towards each other for most of the war by the [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]]. The Soviet Union ended the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|by invading Manchukuo]] on 8 August 1945, due to agreements reached at the [[Yalta Conference]] with Roosevelt and Churchill.

[[Francisco Franco|''Caudillo'' Francisco Franco's]] [[Spain under Franco|Spanish State]] gave moral, economic, and military assistance to the Axis powers, while nominally maintaining neutrality. Franco described Spain as a member of the Axis and signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] in 1941 with Hitler and Mussolini. Members of the ruling [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]] party in Spain held irredentist designs on [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Wylie|2002|p=275}} Falangists also supported Spanish colonial acquisition of [[Tangier]], [[French Morocco]] and northwestern [[French Algeria]].{{sfn|Rohr|2007|p=99}} In addition, Spain held ambitions on former Spanish colonies in Latin America.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} In June 1940 the Spanish government approached Germany to propose an alliance in exchange for Germany recognizing Spain's territorial aims: the annexation of the [[Oran]] province of [[Algeria]], the incorporation of all [[Morocco]], the extension of [[Spanish Sahara]] southward to the twentieth parallel, and the incorporation of [[French Cameroons]] into [[Spanish Guinea]].{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} Spain invaded and occupied the [[Tangier]] International Zone, maintaining its occupation until 1945.{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} The occupation caused a dispute between Britain and Spain in November 1940; Spain conceded to protect British rights in the area and promised not to fortify the area.{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} The Spanish government secretly held expansionist plans towards Portugal that it made known to the German government. In a communiqué with Germany on 26 May 1942, Franco declared that Portugal should be annexed into Spain.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=857}}

Franco had previously won the [[Spanish Civil War]] with the help of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Both were eager to establish another fascist state in Europe. Spain owed Germany over $212 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reginbogin|first1=Herbert|title=Faces of Neutrality: A Comparative Analysis of the Neutrality of Switzerland and other Neutral Nations during WW II|date=2009|publisher=LIT Verlag|page=120|edition=First Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; for supplies of [[matériel]] during the Spanish Civil War, and Italian combat troops had actually fought in Spain on the side of Franco's Nationalists.

From 1940 to 1941, Franco endorsed a Latin Bloc of Italy, Vichy France, Spain, and Portugal, with support from the Vatican in order to balance the countries' powers to that of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs&quot;/&gt; Franco discussed the Latin Bloc alliance with Pétain of Vichy France in [[Montpellier]], France in 1940, and with Mussolini in [[Bordighera]], Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs&quot;/&gt;

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Franco immediately offered to form a unit of military volunteers to join the invasion. This was accepted by Hitler and, within two weeks, there were more than enough volunteers to form a division – the [[Blue Division]] (''División Azul'') under General [[Agustín Muñoz Grandes]].

The possibility of Spanish intervention in World War II was of concern to the United States, which investigated the activities of Spain's ruling Falange party in Latin America, especially [[Puerto Rico]], where pro-Falange and pro-Franco sentiment was high, even amongst the ruling upper classes.{{sfn|Leonard|Bratzel|2007|p=96}} The Falangists promoted the idea of supporting Spain's former colonies in fighting against American domination.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} Prior to the outbreak of war, support for Franco and the Falange was high in the Philippines.{{sfn|Steinberg|2000|p=122}} The [[Falange Exterior]], the international department of the Falange, collaborated with Japanese forces against U.S. and Filipino forces in the [[Philippines]] through the [[Philippine Falange]].{{sfn|Payne|1999|p=538}}

===Vichy France===
{{main article|Vichy France}}
[[File:France map Lambert-93 with regions and departments-occupation.svg|thumb|right|France during the war; [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupied and annexed zones by Germany]] in shades of red, [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|Italian occupation zones]] in shades of green, [[zone libre|&quot;Free zone&quot;]] in blue. ]]
Although officially neutral, Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]'s [[Vichy France|&quot;Vichy regime&quot;]] collaborated with the Axis from June 1940. It retained full control of the [[zone libre|non-occupied part of France]] until November 1942 – when the whole of France was occupied by Germany – and of a large part of France's [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]], until the colonies gradually fell under [[Free French]] control.

The German invasion army entered Paris on 14 June 1940, following the [[battle of France]]. Pétain became the last Prime Minister of the [[French Third Republic]] on 16 June 1940. He sued for peace with Germany and on 22 June 1940, the Vichy government [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|concluded an armistice]] with Hitler. Under the terms of the agreement, Germany [[occupied France|occupied two-thirds]] of France, including Paris. Pétain was permitted to keep an &quot;armistice army&quot; of 100,000 men within the unoccupied southern zone. This number included neither the army based in the [[French colonial empire]] nor the French fleet. In Africa the Vichy regime was permitted to maintain 127,000.{{sfn|Bachelier|2000|p=98}} The French also maintained substantial garrisons at the French-mandated territory of [[Syrian Republic (1930-1958)|Syria]] and [[Greater Lebanon]], the French colony of [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]], and in [[French Somaliland]]. Some members of the Vichy government pushed for closer cooperation, but they were rebuffed by Pétain. Neither did Hitler accept that France could ever become a full military partner,{{sfn|Paxton|1993}} and constantly prevented the buildup of Vichy's military strength.

After the armistice, relations between the Vichy French and the British quickly worsened. Fearful that the powerful French fleet might fall into German hands, the British launched several naval attacks, the most notable of which was against [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir|the Algerian harbour of Mers el-Kebir]] on 3 July 1940. Though Churchill defended his controversial decision to attack the French Fleet, the action deteriorated greatly the relations between France and Britain. German propaganda trumpeted these attacks as an absolute betrayal of the French people by their former allies.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philippe Pétain]] (left) meeting with Hitler in October 1940.]]
On 10 July 1940, Pétain was given emergency &quot;full powers&quot; by a majority vote of the [[French National Assembly]]. The following day approval of the new constitution by the Assembly effectively created the [[French State]] (''l'État Français''), replacing the French Republic with the government unofficially called &quot;Vichy France,&quot; after the resort town of [[Vichy]], where Pétain maintained his seat of government. This continued to be recognised as the lawful government of France by the neutral United States until 1942, while the United Kingdom had recognised [[Free France|de Gaulle's government-in-exile in London]]. Racial laws were introduced in France and its colonies and many [[History of the Jews in France|French Jews]] were deported to Germany. [[Albert Lebrun]], last President of the Republic, did not resign from the presidential office when he moved to [[Vizille]] on 10 July 1940. By 25 April 1945, during Pétain's trial, Lebrun argued that he thought he would be able to return to power after the fall of Germany, since he had not resigned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html Albert Lebrun's biography, French Republic Presidential official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414173559/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html |date=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Philippe Pétain, Chief of State of Vichy France.svg|thumb|right|Personal flag of Philippe Pétain, Chief of State of Vichy France.]]
In September 1940, Vichy France [[invasion of French Indochina|was forced to allow Japan to occupy French Indochina]], a federation of French colonial possessions and protectorates encompassing modern day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Vichy regime continued to administer them under Japanese military occupation. [[French Indochina]] was the base for the Japanese [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invasions of Thailand]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]], and [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]]. In 1945, [[geacps|under Japanese sponsorship]], the [[Empire of Vietnam]] and the [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia#Collaborationist Kingdom of Kampuchea|Kingdom of Kampuchea]] were proclaimed as Japanese puppet states.

On 26 September 1940, de Gaulle [[Battle of Dakar|led an attack by Allied forces on the Vichy port of Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]. Forces loyal to Pétain fired on de Gaulle and repulsed the attack after two days of heavy fighting, drawing Vichy France closer to Germany.

During the [[Anglo–Iraqi War]] of May 1941, Vichy France allowed Germany and Italy to use air bases in the [[French mandate of Syria]] to support the Iraqi revolt. British and Free French forces attacked later [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria and Lebanon in June–July 1941]], and in 1942 Allied forces [[Battle of Madagascar|took over French Madagascar]]. More and more colonies abandoned Vichy, joining the Free French territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]], [[French Polynesia|Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]] and others who had sided with de Gaulle [[Appeal of 18 June|from the start]].

In November 1942 Vichy French troops briefly resisted the [[Operation Torch|landing of Allied troops in French North Africa]] for a couple of days, until Admiral [[François Darlan]] negotiated a local ceasefire with the Allies. In response to the landings, [[Case Anton|Axis troops invaded]] the non-occupied zone in southern France and ended Vichy France as an entity with any kind of autonomy; it then became a puppet government for the occupied territories.

In June 1943, the formerly Vichy-loyal colonial authorities in [[French North Africa]] led by [[Henri Giraud]] came to an agreement with the [[Free French]] to merge with their own interim regime with the [[Free France#Creation of the French National Committee (CNF)|French National Committee]] (''Comité Français National'', CFN) to form a [[provisional government]] in [[Algiers]], known as the [[French Committee of National Liberation]] (''Comité Français de Libération Nationale'', CFLN) initially led by Darlan. After his assassination De Gaulle emerged as the uncontested French leader. The CFLN raised more troops and re-organised, re-trained and re-equipped the Free French military, in cooperation with Allied forces in preparation of future operations [[Operation Husky|against Italy]] and the [[Operation Overlord|German Atlantic wall]].

In 1943 the [[Milice]], a paramilitary force which had been founded by Vichy, was subordinated to the Germans and assisted them in rounding up opponents and Jews, as well as fighting the [[French Resistance]]. The Germans recruited volunteers in units independent of Vichy. Partly as a result of the great animosity of many right-wingers against the pre-war [[Front Populaire]], volunteers joined the German forces in their anti-communist crusade against the USSR. Almost 7,000 joined ''[[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism|Légion des Volontaires Français]]'' (LVF) from 1941 to 1944. The LVF then formed the cadre of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Waffen-SS Division ''Charlemagne'']] in 1944–1945, with a maximum strength of some 7,500. Both the LVF and the ''Division Charlemagne'' fought on the eastern front.

Deprived of any military assets, territory or resources, the members of the Vichy government continued to fulfil their role as German puppets, being quasi-prisoners in the so-called &quot;[[Sigmaringen enclave]]&quot; in a castle in Baden-Württemberg at the end of the war in May 1945.

===Germany's and Italy's declaration of war against the United States===
On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the US naval bases in [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.  According to the stipulation of the Tripartite Pact, Nazi Germany was required to come to the defense of her allies only if they were attacked. Since Japan had made the first move, Germany and Italy were not obliged to aid her until the United States counterattacked. Nevertheless, Hitler ordered the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' to [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|formally declare war on the United States]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2007|p=385}} Italy also [[Italian declaration of war on the United States (1941)|declared war]].

Historian [[Ian Kershaw]] suggests that this declaration of war against the United States was a serious blunder made by Germany, as it allowed the United States to join the war in Europe without any limitation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2007|loc=Chapter 10}} On the other hand, American destroyers escorting convoys had [[battle of the Atlantic|already been de facto at war for months]] with German U-boats in the Atlantic, and the immediate war declaration made the [[Second Happy Time]] possible for U-boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Duncan Redford |author2=Philip D.

The US destroyer Reuben James was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine U-562 on 31 October 1941. Hitler could no longer ignore the amount of economic and military aid the US was giving Britain and the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_3532000/3532401.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Americans played a key role in financing and supplying the Allies, in the strategic bombardment of Germany, and in the final invasion of the continent.

After the [[Strategic bombing|air raid]] on [[Peenemünde]] on 17 August 1943, German strategic command decided to divide the work on the V-2 rocket among three independently operating centres.&lt;ref name=&quot;AleMuzea!&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alemuzea.pl/park-historyczny-blizna/ |title=Polska, Blizna – Park Historyczny Blizna |language=Polish |trans_title=Historical Park in Blizna, Poland |last=Jaskólski, |first=Paweł |work=Alemuzea.Pl |publisher=Projekt AleMuzea! |date=3 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20141130012837/http://alemuzea.pl/park-historyczny-blizna/ |archivedate=30 November 2014 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Middlebrook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidelager Republika&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Glass|2000|p=24}}{{sfn|Dornberger|2004|p=18}} Assembly plants were transferred to underground factories that had been built in a massive hollow cave complex in the [[Harz]] mountains in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidelager Republika&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wnuk2629&gt;[[#refWnuk2012|Wnuk 2012]], p.{{nbsp}}26–29 (Bogdan Chrzanowski)&lt;/ref&gt; The research, development, and design (codenamed &quot;Project Cement&quot;) were handled by secret offices in [[Ebensee]], near the banks of [[Traunsee|Lake Traunsee]] in Austria.&lt;ref name=&quot;AleMuzea!&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidelager Republika&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wnuk2629/&gt; The main rocket testing, training, and launch site was transferred to [[Blizna]] in southeast Poland, outside of the range of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AleMuzea!&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidelager Republika&quot;/&gt; An [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[military base]] near Blizna was set up on 5 November 1943, from which 139 [[V-2 rocket|A4]] (also known as V-2) rockets were launched for experimental purposes and for training.&lt;ref name=&quot;AleMuzea!&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jena&quot;&gt;[[#Jena69|Jena1806.Com]]: 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidelager Republika&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heidelager.republika.pl/ |title=Poligon V1/V2 Blizna |language=Polish |trans_title=Blizna V1/V2 facility |last=Puszkin |first=Piotr |date=26 April 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20160304125039/http://www.heidelager.republika.pl/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RussianSpaceWeb&quot;&gt;[[#Anatoly69|Zak, Anatoly: RussianSpaceWeb.Com]]: 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The site was operational until early July 1944.

Before construction began in Blizna, there was nothing there but uncleared forest.&lt;ref name=&quot;AleMuzea!&quot;/&gt; The Nazis used [[slavery|slave]] labour from the nearby [[Pustków, Podkarpackie Voivodeship#HL-Heidelager|''SS Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager'']] concentration camp in [[Pustków, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Pustków]] to build new infrastructure, starting with concrete roads, then a [[narrow-gauge railway]] line linking to the station at [[Kochanówka, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Kochanówka]] village.&lt;ref name=&quot;AleMuzea!&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidelager Republika&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#refWiąk2003|Wiąk 2003]], p.{{nbsp}}435–439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWnuk2012|Wnuk 2012]], p.{{nbsp}}35 (Marek Flis, Mirosław Surdej)&lt;/ref&gt; They built barracks, bunkers, buildings and all the specialised equipment needed for the operation and firing of rockets.&lt;ref name=&quot;AleMuzea!&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidelager Republika&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#refWnuk2012|Wnuk 2012]], p.{{nbsp}}36 (Marek Flis, Mirosław Surdej)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, efforts were made to disguise the site as much as possible.

British Intelligence were very keen to obtain information about the new V-2 missile site. The first reports came in October 1943 from the Polish underground Home Army ({{lang|pl|Armia Krajowa}}) Intelligence HQ in Warsaw, stating that a number of villages around [[Dębica]] were being forcibly evacuated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;[[#refCampbell2012|Campbell 2012]], p.{{nbsp}}187&lt;/ref&gt; This area was already known for its SS{{nbsp}}training centre [[SS-Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager]]. Further reports brought information about a new railway line being constructed in the same vicinity, leading to [[Blizna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt; A report made on 14 February 1944 gave information about a sighting of a rocket &quot;{{convert|14|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} long and [with] a weight of seven tons&quot;. On 22 February the report was of a projectile &quot;{{convert|12|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} long, [with] a diameter [of] {{convert|1+1/2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} and a weight of twelve tons&quot;. These missiles were being fired 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt; The [[Cryptanalysis|codebreakers]] at [[Bletchley Park]] in England also managed to decrypt vital information from German communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 188&quot;&gt;[[#refCampbell2012|Campbell 2012]], p.{{nbsp}}188&lt;/ref&gt; These made mention of &quot;{{lang|de|''Versuchsstab''}} (experimental staff) {{lang|de|''Komanndostelle''}} Siegfried&quot; and of &quot;''SS-Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager''&quot;. Many more communications were intercepted and decrypted, which together with information from the Polish, helped British Intelligence build up a good picture of what was going on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 188&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAldrich2010|Aldrich 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July 1944, the British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] wrote a [[#Sources|letter]] to [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;J. V.

!'''PERSONAL AND MOST SECRET MESSAGE FROM MR CHURCHILL TO MARSHAL STALIN'''
13 July 1944
 1. There is firm evidence that the Germans have been conducting the trials of flying rockets from an experimental station at
 Dębice in Poland for a considerable time. According to our information this missile has an explosive charge of about twelve
 thousand pounds and the effectiveness of our counter-measures largely depends on how much we can find out about this weapon
 before it is launched against this country. Dębice is in the path of your victorious advancing armies and it may well be that
 you will overrun this place in the next few weeks.

 2. Although the Germans will almost certainly destroy or remove as much of the equipment at Dębice as they can, it is
 probable that a considerable amount of information will become available when the area is in Russian hands. In particular
 we hope to learn how the rocket is discharged as this will enable us to locate the launching sites.

 3. I should be grateful, therefore, Marshal Stalin, if you could give appropriate instructions for the preservation of such
 apparatus and installations at Dębice as your armies are able to ensure after the area has been overrun, and that thereafter
 you would afford us facilities for the examination of this experimental station by our experts.

 – '''[[Winston Churchill]]'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6622">'''Damon Jesse Gause''' (17 June 1915 – 9 March 1944) was an [[United States Army Air Corps]] Officer. He was captured and escaped from Bataan, then Corregidor. He served with the Ninth Air Force and flew with the Hell Hawks. Gause became a hero of World War II.

==Life and times==
Gause was born on 17 June 1915 at [[Fort Valley, Georgia|Fort Valley]] in [[Peach County, Georgia]], the son of Duff Adolph Gause (1893 - 1965) and Jescyne W. Gause (1895 - 1978). The couple had two additional sons, Wilson A. Gause (1923 - 2006) and John Winston Gause (1925 - 2005). On 11 October 1941, Gause married Lillian Ruth Evans Carter (1921 - 2014) and the couple had one son Damon Lance Gause (1943 - 2006). He died at the [[Isle of Wight]] in England on 9 March 1944 when the plane he was flying crashed. Gause was buried in the Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial at Coton, South Cambridgeshire District, Cambridgeshire, England at plot: Plot F Row 3 Grave 85.&lt;ref&gt;Find A Grave Index.

==Education and training==
Gause graduated from the [[Martin Institute|Martin Institute High School]]. After high school, he attended the [[University of Georgia]]. After one year at the University of Georgia, Gause left school to join the [[United States Coast Guard]].

==Career==
In the US Coast Guard, Gause was assigned to the [[USCGC Argo (WPC-100)|USCG Cutter Argo (WPC-100)]] where his main duty was [[radioman]]. He joined the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to serve in [[Panama]] after three years of service in the Coast Guard. Following a three-year stint in the Army, he went to work in the [[oil field]]s in [[Colombia]] for the [[Texaco|Texaco Oil Company]]. In 1939, Gause went back to Georgia. He again enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1941 and qualified for [[flight training]] at [[Kelly Field]] in Texas. Gause completed the training and earned his wings as an [[aircraft pilot]] and received a commission as [[second lieutenant]]. He returned to Georgia, this time at [[Savannah, Georgia]] to serve with the [[27th Bombardment Group]].  He trained on [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|A-24 Banshee]] dive-bombers.

The Hell Hawks were part of the [[Ninth Air Force]]. The combat mission occurred on 22 February 1944 with several groups taking part in an uneventful run to escort bombers. Colonel Lance Call led one group. Another group was led by Major Rockford V. Gray, with Gause as [[wingman]]. Other groups were led by Major [[Donald E. Hillman]] and Major William D. Ritchie. In preparation to support the Allied invasion of Europe, the Hell Hawks moved with the [[365th Fighter Group]] to [[RAF Beaulieu]], Hants, England on 5 March 1944.

The '''Cabanatuan American Memorial,''' formally known as Camp Pangatian, is a [[World War II]] memorial located near [[Cabanatuan|Cabanatuan City]], [[Philippines]]. Camp Pangatian was a military training camp for twenty years until it was converted into a concentration camp for allied prisoners of war during the Japanese occupation. The liberation of Camp Pangatian is known as the most successful tactical rescue mission ever executed by the American military. They were aided by Filipino guerrillas who were fighting the invaders. The [[Raid at Cabanatuan]] was the result of both the [[Bataan Death March]] and [[Prisoner-of-war camp]]. Although the Bataan Death March was a significant historical event, the establishment of its memorial in Cabanatuan was not mentioned in any major U.S. news outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/search/nb?p=AWNB&amp;b=results&amp;action=search&amp;fld0=alltext&amp;val0=filipino+memorial&amp;bln1=AND&amp;fld1=YMD_date&amp;val1=1982&amp;sort=_rank_:D|title=Log in to NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tactical operation was immortalized in the movie [[The Great Raid]]. The memorial was dedicated on April 12, 1982 by the survivors of the [[Bataan Death March]] and the [[prisoner-of-war camp]] at Cabanatuan during World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/pacific/cabanatuan-american-memorial#.WExPZneZPfY|title=Cabanatuan American Memorial {{!}} American Battle Monuments Commission|website=www.abmc.gov|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial has been maintained by the American Battle Grounds Commission since 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Prior to this, it was maintained by the American Battle Monuments Commission.

It is located on the former grounds of the prisoner-of-war camp in honor of those Americans and Filipinos who perished during their internment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The memorial is along the Cabanatuan-Palayan road in [[Barangay]], Pangatian, eight kilometers north of the [[City proper|City Proper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monvalmonte.com/nuevaecijajournal/pangatian/index.html|title=Pangatian War Memorial|last=Valmonte|first=Ramon|website=monvalmonte.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Bataan Death March route vector.svg|thumb|Route of the [[Bataan Death March]]]]
After the surrender of 75,000 Americans by [[Edward P. King|General Edward King Jr.]] to the Japanese forces during World War II, the American troops were forced to march 65 miles from [[Mariveles, Bataan|Mariveles]] to [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], and then ending in [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]]. This is now known as the [[Bataan Death March]]. Camp Pangatian is a current memorial site, which was used as a P.O.W. camp for soldiers who were forced to take part in the [[Bataan Death March]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/bataan-death-march|title=Bataan Death March - World War II - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this event occurred in 1945, no memorial was made until 1982. In 1981, the then-dictator of the Philippines, [[Ferdinand Marcos]], lifted the country from [[martial law]]. Knowing about American anti-communist sentiments, he took advantage of this information. Because the United States feared the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, Marcos presented himself to the U.S. as an anti-communist leader, causing him to receive benefits from the United States. As a result, the Philippines and the United States developed a strong relationship throughout the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://histclo.com/country/oce/phl/hist/ind/phi-cold.html|title=Philippines History: The Cold War|last=|first=|date=2015-06-24|website=Children in History|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Come 1982, the American Battle Monuments Commission wanted to honor those who died in the Bataan Death March. Because of good relationship with the Philippines, the Filipino government allowed construction to begin. President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed a joint resolution, on April 6, 1982, which declared that April 12 be officially celebrated as, &quot;American Salute to Cabanatuan Prisoner of War Memorial Day.&quot; The unveiling of the Cabanatuan memorial, however, was not of much significance to the Filipino people, as no major newspaper on the island printed any information about the memorial or its dedication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/97/hjres435/text|title=Text of H.J.Res. 435 (97th): A joint resolution providing for the designation of April 12, 1982, as &quot;American ...

The dedication, which is located on the back of the Cabanatuan sign, describes the memorial.

=== Addition ===
On April 6, 2003, the provincial government inaugurated a second memorial on a piece of land adjacent to the U.S.-maintained memorial.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The original monument honors the heroism of the American prisoners of war in Pangatian. The second memorial, however, pays a tribute to the Filipino guerrillas who helped in the liberation of Camp Pangatian.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The addition features a circular platform with two tablets from the National Historical Institute. One of these platforms is in Filipino while the other is in English. The tablets read, &quot;ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 30, 1945, FILIPINO GUERRILLAS UNDER CAPTAINS JUAN PAJOTA AND EDUARDO JOSON EFFECTIVELY PREVENTED JAPANESE REINFORCEMENTS AT PANGATIAN CONCENTRATION CAMP IN CABANATUAN. THE BATTLE OF CABU BRIDGE AND THE BLOCKADE AT BANGDAD RESULTED IN THE LIBERATION OF 516 ALLIED PRISONERS OF WAR. THE JOINT OPERATION OF THE GUERRILLAS, ALAMO SCOUTS, AND THE U.S. 6TH RANGER BATTALION WAS UNDER LT. COL. HENRY MUCCI. THIS EVENT ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL RESCUE MISSIONS OF ITS TYPE IN THE ANNALS OF U.S. MILITARY HISTORY.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21843">The naval forces assigned to capture the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilberts]] formed the largest armada yet assembled by either side in the Pacific, considerably larger than the Allied force that mounted the [[Battle of Guadalcanal|invasion of Guadalcanal]] and dwarfing the Japanese force that attacked [[Pearl Harbor Attack|Pearl Harbor]]. They fought between November 20 and November 23, 1943.  The forces can be summarized as follows:

'''TF 50 – Carrier Force:'''
* 6 fleet carriers, 6 light carriers, 5 battleships, 3 heavy cruisers, 3 anti-aircraft light cruisers, 21 destroyers

'''TF 52 – Northern Attack Force (Makin):'''
* 3 escort carriers, 4 battleships, 4 heavy cruisers, 16 destroyers, 9 transports &amp; landing ships

{{main article|Battle of Makin}}

'''TF 53 – Southern Attack Force (Tarawa):'''
* 5 escort carriers, 3 battleships, 2 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, 22 destroyers, 2 minesweepers, 18 transports &amp; landing ships

===Naval===
The roles of Commander in Chief, [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] (CINCPOA) and Commander in Chief, [[US Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]] (CINCPAC), were both exercised by Admiral [[Chester Nimitz|'''Chester W. Nimitz''']] from his headquarters at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]].

Since the Gilberts and Marshalls lie in the Central Pacific, their capture was the responsibility of the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet]], led by Vice Admiral '''[[Raymond A. Spruance]]''' from aboard his flagship, heavy cruiser ''Indianapolis''.

The ships and troops of Operations Galvanic (landings on Tarawa Atoll) and Kourbash (landings on Makin Atoll) were under direct operational command of Rear Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|'''Richmond Kelly Turner''']] aboard battleship ''Pennsylvania''.

In case Admiral [[Mineichi Koga]] attempted to disrupt Fifth Fleet's operations, Spruance was to strip all combat ships not needed to cover the landings, join with the fast carrier forces and engage the Japanese. In the event, Koga's [[Combined Fleet]] never stirred from its anchorage at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk Lagoon]] in the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]].

===Ground troops===
'''V Amphibious Corps''' (Maj. Gen. [[Holland M. Smith]], USMC)
* Tarawa: [[2nd Marine Division]] (Maj. Gen. [[Julian C. Smith]], USMC)
* Makin: [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Infantry Division (Army)]] (Maj. Gen. [[Ralph C. Smith]], USA)

Both Admiral Turner and General Holland Smith sailed with the Northern Attack Force even though it was obvious that Tarawa would be the scene of the main ground action. If the Japanese mounted a counterattack, it was most likely to come from the Marshalls since the closest Japanese bases to the Gilberts were located there. Nimitz and Spruance wanted the two highest ranking officers to sail with the forces that would be the first to encounter any such enemy response. Unbeknownst to the Americans, the Japanese had stripped almost all their naval and air assets from the Marshalls in an attempt to resist the Allied effort in the [[New Georgia Campaign|Central Solomons]]. Thus, no counterattack materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Tarawa 1943: The Turning of the Tide'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Organization of the Kriegsmarine''' refers to the operational and administrative structure of the German Navy from 1935 to 1945.  Many of the organizational tenants of the [[Kriegsmarine]] were inherited from its predecessor the [[Reichsmarine]].  As [[World War II]] unfolded, the Kreigsmarine expanded to cover additional regions and responsibilities, most significant of which was the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupation of France]] and the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].

==Navy High Command==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-128-63, Erich Raeder.jpg|thumb|225px|Erich Raeder was the longest serving commander of the Kriegsmarine, holding the post for nearly eight years, before resigning due to disagreements of naval policy with [[Adolf Hitler]].]]
The ultimate command authority for the Kriegsmarine was the ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' - OKM which was headed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Germany Navy (''Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine'').  The OKM in turn answered to the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'', however naval affairs were often run independently from the wishes of the Army, under the authority of the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]''.  The Navy and the [[Luftwaffe]] (Air Force) further had little coordination, leading to serious delays in the development of naval aviation.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, M.J., Warship 33: Graf Zeppelin, Part 2, Annapolis: United States Naval Institute Press (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following personnel served as Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy from the inception of the Kriegsmarine in 1935 until the downfall of Nazi Germany ten years later.

* [[Erich Raeder]]: 1935 - 1943 (also had served as Reichsmarine CinC)
* [[Karl Dönitz]]: 1943 - 1945 (previously had served as Commander of Submarines)
* [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]]: May 1945 (served for 22 days until suicide)
* [[Walter Warzecha]]: May - June 1945 (served for one month until post disbanded)

Internal to the OKM were several additional offices, the most important of which the ''[[Seekriegsleitung]]'' - SKL which coordinated naval warfare and operational plans.  Offices also existed for naval construction, weapons, as well as general office for naval affairs (''Allgemeines Marineamt'').  A supply and logistics office, known as the ''Marinekommandoamt'', was in charge of all quartermaster needs.

The Kriegsmarine did not maintain an independent naval intelligence branch, but instead relied upon the ''[[Abwehr]]'' which coordinated intelligence for all branches of the German military.  Naval admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]] was Chief of the Abwehr for most of its existence until he was replaced just prior to the [[20 July plot]] against Hitler.  Thereafter the Abwehr was folded into the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' and was run by the [[SS]] under [[Walter Schellenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Goerlitz, Walter. History of the German General Staff, 1657-1945. Boulder and London: Westview Press (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fleet commander===

{{main|Fleet commander (Kriegsmarine)}}

The fleet commander of the Kriegsmarine, who was a member of the Navy High Command, was the highest administrative officer to which the vessel type commanders answered.  The position did not actually command an at-sea fleet, but was more comparable to a modern-day [[Chief of Naval Operations]] or [[Inspector of the Navy]].

==Navy Type Commands==
The Navy type commanders were permanently assigned administrative officers which oversaw the development, deployment, and in some cases operational activities of the various classes of [[List of Kriegsmarine ships|German naval vessel]]s.  Due to cross jurisdiction with the Navy group commanders, who tactically commanded all vessels at sea, some type commanders were little more than ceremonial officers who held a title with little authority.  Others, such as  [[Karl Dönitz]] who commanded the German [[U-boat]] force, exercised near total independence and held enormous authority, both operationally and administrative.

The type commands of [[minesweeper]]s and [[patrol boat]]s were under direct control of the Harbor Security Command (''Sicherungsstreitkräfte'') and thus were not considered as regular type commanders in comparison to other classes of vessels.

===Battleships and Cruisers===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-04-1-26, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|315px|right|German battleships were originally under their own type command until merger with the cruiser command]]
The battleship and cruiser type commands were originally separate offices, beginning with an office inherited from the Reichsmarine known as the ''Befehlshaber der Linienschiffe'' (Commander of [[Ships of the Line]], also known as &quot;[[Commander of Liners]]&quot;).  In February 1938, the command was renamed as ''Befehlshaber der Panzerschiffe'' and assigned to ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' [[Wilhelm Marschall]].  The following year, Marschall was named as the new Kriegsmarine fleet commander and no successor was appointed to lead the battleship branch.  The post remained vacant until June 1941 when it was merged with the cruiser type command to form the ''Befehlshaber der Schlachtschiffe (B.d.S)'' (Commander of Battleships).

[[Otto Ciliax]] served as commander of battleships until May 1942 when the command was abolished completely and thereafter battleship type affairs were placed back under the authority of the cruiser type commander.  The cruiser type command had originally begun as an umbrella senior position, known as the ''Befehlshaber der Aufklärungsstreitkräfte (B.d.A.)'', which commanded all cruiser type vessels as well as serving as the superior officer for the type commanders of torpedo boats and minesweepers.  This position was held by four Kriegsmarine officers between 1935 and 1941, when the title was disbanded and merged with the ''Befehlshaber der Schlachtschiffe (B.d.S)''.

'''Commander of Surface Craft (1935-1941)'''

* Vice admiral [[Hermann Boehm]] (Inaugural holder - carried over position from Reichsmarine since September 1934) 
* Vice admiral [[Hermann Densch]] (September 1937 - October 1939)
* Vice admiral [[Günther Lütjens]] (October 1939 - April 1940)
* Vice admiral [[Hubert Schmundt]] (April 1940 - October 1941)

'''Commander of Cruisers (1942-1944)'''

Between April and May 1942, the German surface fleet was reorganized with the torpedo boat and battleship type commands discontinued and placed under the authority of a new cruiser command known as the ''Befehlshaber der Kreuzer (B.d.K.)''.  Vice admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]] then became the first cruiser type commander serving until November 1943 when he was succeeded by ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Erich Bey]].  In June 1944, the cruiser type command was renamed as the ''Befehlshaber der Kampfgruppe (B.d.K.)'' and the position assumed by Rear admiral [[Rudolf Peters]] who held the title untl the end of the war.

The combined battleship and cruise type command at its height consisted of the following ten vessels.

* [[German battleship Bismarck|Battleships Bismarck]] &amp; [[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]
* [[German battleship Gneisenau|Battleships Gneisenau]] and [[German battleship Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]]
* [[German cruiser Deutschland|Cruiser Deutschland]] (later renamed as the Cruiser Lützow)
* [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|Cruisers Admiral Hipper]], [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]], &amp; [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Admiral Graf Spee]]
* [[German cruiser Blücher|Cruisers Blücher]] &amp; [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]

===Destroyers===
[[File:German destroyer Z39 underway off Boston on 12 September 1945.jpg|thumb|295px|[[German World War II destroyers|German destroyers]] were administratively under the authority of a type commander, but deployed operationally under Navy Group commands]]

The posting of Commander of Destroyers (''Führer der Zerstörer'') was first created in November 1939; prior to that time, all destroyer development and deployment had been under the authority of the Commander of Torpedo Boats.  All German destroyers were further divided into eight administrative flotillas (Z-Flotille), each contained between four to five destroyer with its own flotilla commander and flagship. Operationally, destroyers were deployed under the authority of the Naval group commanders, leaving the commander of destroyers as little more than administrative head with little tactical control.  In April 1942, the position was increased in its responsibility when all German torpedo boats were placed under the administrative control of the Leader of Destroyers.

The following officers served as Commander of Destroyers during the Second World War.

* ''[[Kommodore]]'' [[Friedrich Bonte]] (November 1939 - April 1940)
** Duties assumed by deputy, ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' Schemmel, from April to May 1940
* ''[[Kapitan zur See]]'' Erich Bey (May 1940 - December 1943)
* ''Kapitan zur See'' [[Max-Eckart Wolff]] (December 1943 - February 1944)
* ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Leo Kreisch]] (February 1944 - May 1945)

===Submarines===

{{main|Befehlshaber der U-Boote}}

The commander of submarines held the most authority and independence of any type commander and possessed direct operational and deployment ability.  This was in contrast to other vessel class commanders which were administratively assigned with deployment and tactical operations usually under a Navy group commander.  Karl Dönitz was the first and longest serving commander of submarines, a title which he inaugurated in January 1936 as the ''[[Führer der Unterseeboote]]''.  In the early days of Dönitz's tenure, his submarine force consisted of a single flotilla which he also commanded.  At the height of [[World War II]], the submarine force consisted of several [[List of U-boat regions|U-boat regional commands]] within which were interspersed over thirty [[List of U-boat flotillas|U-boat flotillas]].

The submarine force would see its greatest amount of combat in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].  Dönitz himself personally directed the movement of individual submarines from his headquarters and also invented the &quot;[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]&quot; concept where submarines would group together to attack multiple targets.  The wolf packs were temporary tactical formations and were not permanently maintained as the U-boat flotillas were.  U-boat flotillas and regions also did not maintain flagships on a particular U-boat, but instead operated from an established shore headquarters.

In January 1943, Dönitz succeeded [[Erich Raeder]] as Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy.  In his new position, Dönitz channeled most of the remaining resources of the Kreigsmarine into the submarine force, leading to a neglect and downsizing of the surface fleet.  Dönitz also retained his title as commander of submarines, but left the day to day operations to his deputy [[Eberhard Godt]].

===Torpedo and Attack boats===
[[File:T 35 as DD 935 in US seas August 1945.jpg|thumb|275px|A German torpedo boat in 1945]]
{{main|Leader of Torpedo-boats}}

The position ''Führer der Torpedoboote'' dated in the German Navy from before the First World War and had existed as a command for all German surface craft during the inter-war years of the 1930s. By the outbreak of World War II, torpedo boats were organized into ten separate ''Torpedobootsflottille'', mostly consisting of between ten to twelve [[Elbing-class torpedo boat|torpedo destroyers]].  During the first years of the war, the Leader of Torpedo-boats was administratively assigned as a subordinate to the ''Befehlshaber der Aufklärungsstreitkräfte''.  The torpedo boat leader postilion carried little operational authority; in April 1942, the position was disbanded with all torpedo boats placed under the administrative command of the Leader of Destroyers.

'''Leader of Torpedo-boats (1935-1942)'''

* Oskar Kummetz: (inaugural holder - carried over position from Reichsmarine)
* Günther Lütjens: (October 1937 - October 1939)
* Friedrich Bonte: (October - November 1939)
* [[Hans Bütow]]: (November 1939 - April 1942)

'''Leader of Attack Boats'''

German Navy fast attack boats, also known as S-boats or [[E-boat]]s, were organized into twenty four ''Schnellbootsflottille'', collectively known as the ''Schnellbootseinheiten''.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, G. &amp; Palmer, I., German E-boats 1939–45. Osprey Publishing (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  These attack boats were operationally controlled by various commands of the German Navy and administratively had originally been under the command of the Leader of Torpedo-boats.  In April 1942, the attack boats were separated to become their own type class and placed under the command of the ''Führer der Schnellboote''.  Kommodore [[Rudolf Petersen (Kapitän zur See)|Rudolf Petersen]] was the only officer to hold this title during World War II.

===Motorboats and Auxiliary craft===

A command for German motorboats, mainly consisting of inland waterway craft as well as small support vessels, was established in January 1941 as a subordinate to the Netherlands Navy Regional Command.  The command was known as ''Der Führer der Motorbootsverbände''.  There were three flotillas of motor craft originally attached, these being the [[Danube|Donauflottille]], [[Rhine|Rheinflottille]], and Flußräumflottille Niederlande.  In 1942, the Donauflottille was renamed as the [[Meuse|Maasflottille]]&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann W. &amp; Hildebrand H., Die Deutsche Kriegsmarine, Verlag Hans-Henning Podzun, Bad Nauheim (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leader of Motorboats (1941-1945)'''

* ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' Hans Stubbendorff (January 1941 - April 1941)
* ''Korvettenkapitän'' Gustav Strempel (April 1941 - January 1942)
* ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' Hanns Mitzka (January 1942 - March 1942)
* ''Korvettenkapitän'' Alfred Griesinger (March 1942 - December 1943)
* ''Korvettenkapitän'' Erich Schimmelpfennig (December 1943 -  March 1944)
* ''Korvettenkapitän'' Alfred Griesinger (March 1944 - September 1944)
* ''Korvettenkapitän der Reserve'' Heinrich Engel (September 1944 - March 1945)

==Navy Group Commands==
[[File:KriegsmarineMap.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Navy group operational areas in 1943]]
The Navy Group Commands were the highest operational authority of the Kriegsmarine and held direct tactical control of all naval vessels and personnel in their region of responsibility.  In contract to other navies, the Kriegsmarine did not use [[numbered fleet]]s, but instead used geographical regions to determine operational control.  Thus, vessels were not permanently assigned to a group, but were administratively commanded by a type commander and then operationally deployed into a particular Navy Group commander's area.

The original Navy group commands were formed from the preexisting Baltic and North Sea Fleets which had existed under the Reichsmarine.  Navy Group Command &quot;West&quot; was formed at [[Wilhelmshaven]] while &quot;Ost&quot; was based out of Kiel.  Both commands were activated in November 1938 with Admiral [[Conrad Albrecht]] commanding Group East while [[Alfred Saalwächter]] commanded in the west.  Command of Group East was assumed by Admiral [[Rolf Carls]] in October 1939 and he held the command until August 1940 when Group East was disbanded and merged with the new Navy Group North.  Admiral Saalwächter continued as commander of Navy Group West until after the invasion of France when the position was assumed by Admiral Wilhelm Marschall who had previously served as the Navy Region Commander for Northern France.  Marschall served as Commander Navy Group West during the opening years of the Battle of the Atlantic; he was later succeeded in April 1943 by Admiral [[Theodor Krancke]] who held the position until the German withdrawal from France and the disbandment of Navy Group West in October 1944.

Navy Group North became a highly significant command following the invasion of Norway.  In March 1943, command was assumed by [[Otto Schniewind]] who also held dual assignment as the Kriegsmarine fleet commander.  Schniewind's title was ''Marinegruppenkommando Nord und Flottenchef'' which he held until his command was disbanded in July 1944.  Thereafter, naval operations in the North Sea were controlled directly by the OKM.

Naval operation command of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] was established in February 1941 through a command known as &quot;Admiral Z&quot; and headed by ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière]].  However, Arnauld de la Perière was killed in a plane crash shortly after assuming this post with command then transferred to Admiral [[Karlgeorg Schuster]].  In April 1941, Schuster's command was renamed as &quot;Admiral Südost&quot;.  In July of that year, the Italian-Mediterranean Area was elevated to the status of a Navy Group and became known as ''Marinegruppenkommando Süd''.  Sub-commands to the Navy Group South also existed for naval forces operating off of the coasts of [[Tunisia]] and [[North Africa]].

Wilhelm Marschall served as Commander Navy Group South from December 1941 to March 1943.  He was then replaced by Admiral [[Kurt Fricke]] who held the position until the end of the war.

===Tactical operations===

During tactical operations, the Navy group commanders served in the same capacity as an operational fleet commander.  Units under their command were organized into naval task forces, groups, as well as independently assigned units.  The commanders of the task forces and groups were temporarily assigned, most often from the ranks of the naval type and flotilla commanders.  One of the largest naval operations of the Kriegsmarine, the [[Operation Weserübung|invasion of Norway]], saw a [[Norwegian Campaign order of battle#Kriegsmarine|naval order of battle]] consisting of a battleship force, six warship groups, as well as numerous other combat and support craft grouped into &quot;objective groups&quot; as well as temporary at-sea flotillas.

Naval transport craft, considered an integral part of [[amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]], were grouped into five primary ''Transportflottillen'' which were deployed as needed to support naval operations under the authoirty of a Navy group commander.  Four additional transport flotillas, based in specific geographical regions, were located in [[Danzig]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Lower Rhine|Niederrhein]] and along the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr river]].  The Kriegsmarine also maintained a smaller transport company in the Netherlands, known as the &quot;Fährflottille [[Waal (river)|Waal]]&quot;.

===Special operations===

Navy special operations, which included the operation of [[Midget submarine#Germany|miniature submarine]]s and Navy [[frogman]] units, were grouped under a single command known as the ''Kommando der Kleinkampfverbände''.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, L., Weapons of Desperation: German Frogmen and Midget Submarines of World War II, Chatham Publishing (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The command was established in April 1944, under ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Hellmuth Heye]]; Heye would hold the position until the end of World War II.  Special operations were originally grouped into five command regions: West, South, Holland, Norway, and a special region known as ''[[Skagerrak|Skagerak]], zugleich z.b.V.''.  In the spring of 1945, the regions were reconsolidated into the following six special operation divisions:

* 1st K-Division ([[Narvik]])
* 2nd K-Division ([[Trondheim]])
* 3rd K-Division ([[Bergen]])
* 4th K-Division (the [[Netherlands]])
* 5th K-Division (also in the Netherlands)
* 6th K-Division (the [[Mediterranean|Mediterranean Sea]])

Dispersed through the various special operations divisions were a total of eight '' Lehrkommando'', numbering from 200 through 800.  The smallest special operation units, known as ''K-Flottille'' ovsersaw direct operations of the small battle units and submarines, and were numbered according to their parent ''Lehrkommano'' (i.e. K-Flottille 215, K-Flottille 416, etc).  K-Flottille 311 was specifically designated to oversee deployment of the [[Hecht (submarine)|Hecht]] miniature submarine while the [[Seehund]] submarines were dispersed between K-Flottille 312, 313, and 314.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, P., Midget Submarines of the Second World War, Chatham Publishing (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Naval regions and districts of the Kriegsmarine}}
Naval regional commands were the senior most shore authority for the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War.  There were four naval regions established from 1938 to 1942 ([[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], South, and Norway).  Regional commanders oversaw a large staff consisting of naval inspectors, administrative offices, permanently assigned naval shore units, and also served as the senior commander for any naval [[prisoner-of-war]] camps as well as the reporting senior for the naval [[arsenal]]s.  A deputy position, known as the &quot;2.Admiral&quot;, served as head of regional administration and as the senior officer for all transient personnel.

===Naval Districts===

Naval districts were the immediate operational command for most shore units and were usually commanded by a rear or vice admiral.  In the early years of World War II, in particular following the invasion of France, naval districts held relatively the same authority as a Navy region; by 1943, the naval districts had been downsized, with the larger districts broken apart into several smaller commands.  There were approximately twenty naval districts in existence from 1941 to 1945.  A special district, known as &quot;District Southeast&quot;, dealt specifically with inland waterways and was based at [[Traunstein]].

In some of the more important naval districts, there were were further lower administrative commands known as ''Marine-Abschnitts'' (Naval areas).  In France, this areas were known as ''Kriegsmarinedienststellen''.  Another type of local command was the [[sea defense zone]] (''Seeverteidigung''), which was a tactical operational area intended to defend the German coast line against actual attack by enemy forces.

===Navy Ports===
{{main|List of German naval ports during World War II}}

The German Navy divided ports into two separate categories with larger ports commanded by a ''Hafenkommandanten'' (Port Commander) while the remainder of ports were overseen by a Port Captain (''Hafenkapitäne''). Ports in the same geographical area were grouped together into administrative areas known as ''Hafenkommandanten im Bereich''.  Larger ports were commanded by officers ranked ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' or ''Kapitän zur See'', while smaller ports were typically commanded by a ''[[Fregattenkapitän]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann W. &amp; Hildebrand H., Die Deutsche Kriegsmarine, Verlag Hans-Henning Podzun, Bad Nauheim (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval ports were led by a command staff with lower departments covering maintenance, medical care, supply, as well as personnel administration.  Personnel permanently assigned to the port were part of the port's naval garrison, while those assigned to ships and submarines answered to their own commanders.  For crews who berthed in shore facilities, instead of onboard ship (especially in the case of in-port submarines), these personnel were administratively reportable to the port authorities.

Port security was divided into shore security, harbor security, and land defense.  Every port maintained its own small security force as part of the ''Marine Kustenpolizei'' (Navy Shore Police) which was augmented by a larger unit known as the  ''Landesschützen-Kompanie'' which also included naval reservists.  Harbor security was maintained by a completely separate command chain and did not operationally involve the port commander.  The port commander further did not command the naval land defense units, such as flak batteries and naval coastal artillery, which also answered to their own chains of command.

Most German ports also maintained a large contingent of civilian [[Stevedore|dock worker]]s and frequently employed senior civilian engineers to oversee shipbuilding and repair.  In France, the [[French resistance]] made extensive use of dock workers to gather intelligence about German naval activity, in particular the comings and goings of German u-boats from port.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, F., The French Resistance, 1940–44. London: Lawrence and Wishart&lt;/ref&gt;  Sabotage was also a constant problem for the Germans in occupied ports, leading to the creation of a special [[SS]] unit, the ''SS-Hafensicherungstruppen'', which was comprised of [[Allgemeine-SS]] reservists who performed port security and night watch duties.

===Harbor Security Commands===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-M2KBK-249-32, Frankreich, M-Boot auf See.jpg|thumb|305px|right|German minesweepers were the mainstay force of the Harbor Security Commands]]
Waterborne security within German [[harbors]] was maintained by a separate chain of command from the traditional shore establishment, and in many cases even bypassed the administrative command of the German ports themselves.  The security of all harbors in Nazi occupied Europe was under the authority of three senior geographical regions lead by a ''Befehlshaber der Sicherung'' (Commander of Security).  The first such position was established in 1937 as the ''Befehlshaber der Sicherung der Nordsee (B.S.N.)'' (Commander of Security in the North Sea) and was led by ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Otto von Schrader]].  The North Sea security region originally only oversaw the major port of Wilhelmshaven, as well as some smaller naval stations, but during World War II was greatly expanded under [[Eberhard Wolfram]].  The final North Sea security commander, appointed April 1943, was Rear admiral [[Ernst Lucht]].

Baltic sea harbor and water security was overseen by the ''Befehlshaber der Sicherung der Ostsee (B.S.O.)''.  The command was established in January 1939 under Vice admiral [[Hermann Mootz]].  For the majority of the Second World War, [[Hans Stohwasser]] served as security commander with the final command, Rear admiral [[Hans Bütow]], appointed in June 1944.  In October 1940, the German Navy also established its largest security area covering all harbors and ports in occupied western Europe.  The command was known as the ''Befehlshaber der Sicherung West (B.S.W.)'' with Hermann Mootz appointed as its first commander in October 1940.  Command passed through two other officers in 1941 ([[Hermann von Fischel]] and [[Friedrich Ruge]]), with the security area commanded by an acting deputy in early 1943.  The final western area security commander was Read admiral [[Erich Alfred Breuning]] who served from June 1943 until the end of the war.

In 1944, an inland waterways security command was established known as the ''Führer der Sicherungsstreitkräfte (B.d.Sich.)''.  The command was headquartered in [[Świnoujście|Swinemünde]] and was the administrative command for waterborne security on the [[Danube]]; operationally, units were commanded by a subordinate unit known as the &quot;Sicherungs-Lehr-Division&quot;.  The command was later transferred to [[Bergen]] where it operated one transport flotilla and commanded the U-boat service training school for boats stationed in Norway.  The unit's final commander was Rear admiral Ernst Lucht.

====Minesweepers====

The security commanders oversaw the tactical operations of various German harbor defense craft, the largest contingent of which were the [[M-class minesweeper (Germany)|German minesweeper]]s, followed by the Minesweeper auxiliary craft (known as ''Räumbooten'' or &quot;[[R boat]]s&quot;).  Various commands for German minesweepers had existed since before the First World War; the Kriegsmarine created thier own Minesweeper command from an office of the Reichsmarine which had been established in October 1933.

The Kriegsmarine position, known as ''Führer der Minensuchboote'' (Leader of Minesweepers) was established in May 1937 under the command of ''Kapitän zur See'' [[Friedrich Ruge]]. At the start of World War II, the Minesweeper command position was split into two separate regions, east and west, with Rear admiral [[Hans Stohwasser]] commanding as ''Führer der Minensuchboote Ost'' until the position was re-assumed by Ruge, now with the rank of ''[[Kommodore]]''.  Stohwasser then assumed command of minesweepers in the Baltic sea under the title ''Führer der Minensuchboote Ost''.  In August 1940, Stohwasser's command was expanded to the North Sea and he became the first ''Führer der Minensuchboote Nord (F.d.M. Nord)''.  His duties in the Baltic were assumed by Rear admiral [[Kurt Böhmer]] in March 1942.

Administratively, minesweepers were organized into over forty ''Minensuchflottille'', each containing between six to eight minesweepers.  These vessels were then assigned to various German harbors where they were operationally controlled by the Harbor Security Commanders.  Beginning in 1941, an intermediary command was established known as the ''Sicherungs-Divisionen'' (Security Division) which grouped all minesweepers, patrol boats, and submarine chasers into a single local command.  There were eleven security divisions established by 1944 in order to control security within German Navy ports and harbors.

'''Minelayers'''

{{emptysection|date=February 2017}}

====Submarine Chasers====

German [[submarine chaser]]s were organized into ten ''U-Jagdflottille'' which were commanded by a flotilla officer who answered to the naval security commanders.  The first submarine chaser flotilla was established in August 1939 with the last stood up in August 1944.  Individual vessels were converted merchant craft, some of which were only designated by numbers rather than vessel names.   

'''Submarine Chaser Flotillas'''

* 1st UJ-Flottille (Baltic Sea)
* 2nd UJ-Flottille ([[Adriatic Sea]])
* 3rd UJ-Flottille ([[Black Sea]])
* 11th UJ-Flottille (Norway)
* 12th UJ-Flottille (North Sea)	
* 14th UJ-Flottille (Atlantic Coast)
* 17th UJ-Flottille (Norway)
* 21st UJ-Flottille ([[Aegean Sea]])
* 22nd UJ-Flottille ([[Tyrrhenian Sea]])
* 23rd UJ.-Flottille ([[Black Sea]])

As submarine chasers were considered &quot;auxiliary craft&quot;, there was originally no type commander for this class of vessel.  In January 1940, all submarine chaser flotillas were placed under a new command known as the ''Führer der Sonderverbände'' (Leader of Special Craft), of which two positions were created (east and west) for operations in the Baltic-North Sea and Atlantic-Mediterranean respectively.  The position was designated to be commanded by a ''Kapitän zur See'' to which the various submarine chaser flotilla commanders would answer. These senior commands were also briefly responsible for the administration of German minelayers, but in 1941 the commands were dissolved and auxiliary craft functions were taken over by the Leader of Patrol Craft (''Führer der Vorpostenboote'').

====Patrol and Sentry Boats====

German patrol boats (''[[Vorpostenboot]]en'') were most often converted small civilian craft outfitted for harbor escort and perimeter defense.

==Ground and staff forces==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R63849, Walter Ohmsen.jpg|thumb|225px|A coastal artillery officer wearing the Navy's shore personnel uniform]]
Kriegsmarine ground personnel were permanently based at shore assignments, usually due to the nature of their career field.  Staff and support personnel typically rotated between shore and sea duty, depending upon the nature of their assignment.

===Naval Infantry===
The Kriegsmarine maintained a large ground force, organized along the same lines as the German Army, which was known as the ''Marine-Infanterie''.  There were five active ''Marine-Infanterie-Divisionen'' as well as two independent Marine Infantry Brigades.  Internally, each division and brigade contained a number of regiments which were divided into the following classes:

* ''Marine-Infanterie-Regimenter'' (Naval [[Infantry]] Regiment) 	
* ''Marine-Schützen-Regimenter'' (Naval Rifle Regiment)
* ''Marine-Grenadier-Regimenter'' (Naval [[Grenadier]] Regiment
* ''Marine-Ersatz-Regiment'' (Naval Replacement Regiment)

Within each regiment were subordinate ''Marine-Bataillone''.  The Kriegsmarine also maintained two ''Divisionskampfgruppen'' (Divisional Combat Groups) which were composed of three rifle and two replacement regiments.

===Naval Artillery and Anti-Aircraft===

Kriegsmarine naval artillery and [[anti-aircraft]] crews were considered as shore personnel and assigned to either the ''Marine-Artillerie-Einheiten'' (for naval artillery) or ''Marine-Flak-Einheiten'' (anti-aircraft).  Artillery units were organized into either regiments or sections while flak units were maintained in brigades and regiments.  Both types of units were assigned to various ports and harbors and thus were under the direct operational authority of both the port commanders as well as the commander harbor security forces.  During actual invasion of coastal regions by enemy forces, these units became part of the [[sea defense zone]]s.

===Staff and support units===

The Kriegsmarine maintained several dedicated staff units which were maintained as independent units normally attached to a Navy shore command.  Members of the staff corps could also be interspersed into regular Navy units, such as ships and shore bases, to serve as part of the regular compliment.  The following were the four primary staff and support units:

* ''Marine-Pionier-Einheiten'' (Naval engineers)
* ''Marine-Nachrichten'' (Naval signal units)
* ''Marine-Kraftfahr-Kompanie'' (Naval transport companies)
* ''Sanitätseinheiten'' (Medical units)

==Independent operations==
[[File:Hilfskreuzer Atlantis.jpg|thumb|295px|Commerce raiders, like the [[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|Auxiliary cruiser '&quot;Atlantis'']] seen here, often operated independently]]
The German [[Merchant raider|commerce raider]]s were nominally independent, reporting to the ''Seekriegsleitung'' for administrative purposes.  During the later years of World War II, units known as ''Netzsperrgruppe'' ([[blockade runner]] groups) were formed under the authority of Navy regional commanders.  The groups were further subdivided into smaller ''Netzsperrflottillen'' which contained between six to twelve assigned vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt &amp; Schenk, Deutsche Netzsperrverbände, Berlin, Edition Erich Gröner, (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

German vessels operating off of [[South America]], such as the ''[[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Admiral Graf Spee]]'', were also considered on &quot;extended detached duty&quot; and reported directly to the OkM.  German naval forces operating off of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] were also not under a naval group and typically answered to their type commander&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, Jürgen. Chronology of the War at Sea, 1939–1945: The Naval History of World War Two. Annapolis: US Naval Institute Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The officers and crew of the ''[[German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' existed in a unique state since the vessel was not commissioned and those onboard were mainly involved in construction as well as upkeep.  The direct authority for this &quot;housekeeping crew&quot; was vague and those assigned to the ''Graf Zepplin'' appeared to have rotated between various higher commands depending upon the location and status of the aircraft carrier&lt;ref&gt;Schenk, Peter. &quot;German Aircraft Carrier Developments&quot;.

'''Naval regions and districts of the Kriegsmarine''' were the [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine|official shore establishment]] of the [[German Navy]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].  The [[Kriegsmarine]] shore establishment was divided into four senior regional commands, who were in turn subordinated to the operational [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine#Navy Group Commands|Navy Group commanders]] who commanded all sea and shore naval forces within a particular geographical region.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann W. &amp; Hildebrand H., Die Deutsche Kriegsmarine, Verlag Hans-Henning Podzun, Bad Nauheim (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;  Within each naval region were several subordinate naval districts who were responsible for all navy shore activities within their area of responsibility, most significantly were the various [[List of German naval ports during World War II|German ports]] of [[German-occupied Europe|occupied Europe]].

==Naval regions==

The naval regions (''Maineoberkommando'') were the senior most shore command in a given geographical area, of which four existed, and were subordinate to the Navy Group commanders.  A total of four naval regions were eventually established in occupied Europe during the Second World War.  A deputy commander, known as the &quot;2. Admiral&quot; commanded staff units and oversaw regional administrative matters.  Specifically, the deputy region commander oversaw the ''Schiffsstamm-Abteilung'' (Ship's Administration Department) which was a liaison for port commands and also served as the ultimate authority for personnel in transit or stationed in shore naval garrisons.  For those permanent assigned to the ship's department, a subordinate ''Schiffsstamm Regiment'' existed as an intermediary command.&lt;ref&gt;Goerlitz, Walter. History of the German General Staff, 1657-1945. Boulder and London: Westview Press (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major subordinates to the regional command were the ''Befehlshaber der Sicherung'' (Commander of Security), ''Schiffsmaschineninspektion'' (Naval engineering inspector), ''Artilleriearsenalinspektionen'' (Inspector of [[arsenal]]s and [[artillery]]), and the ''Sanitätsamt der Marinestation'' (Medical department).  A regional signals detachment (''Marinenachrichtenabteilung'') also existed to coordinate orders and messages between the various subordinate commands.

All naval regions were permanently assigned at least one navy shore combat unit.  In most cases this was known as the ''Marine-Schützen-Bataillon''; a larger formation known as a ''Marine-Bordflak-Brigade'' also existed.  Engineering and [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]] naval units were typically grouped into a ''Marine-Festungspionier-Bataillon''.  Regional commands were also responsbile for the operation of all naval [[brigs]], which were known as ''Prisenhof''.  Naval [[prisoner-of-war]] camps were under the jurisidction of a senior officer known as the ''Kommandantur des Marine-Kriegsgefangenen- und Interniertenlagers''.

All naval regions further maintained a legal office as well as a war correspondence company (''Marinekriegsberichterkompanie'').  All induction and recruiting centers operated through an office known as the ''Marine-Abrechnungs- und Vorprüfungsamt'' while the ''Dienststelle für Eignungsprüfung'' administrated certification examinations for the various [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine#Kriegsmarine rates|naval rates]].  Each naval region also maintained a billeting and housing office, known as the ''Abwicklungsamt''.

===Naval Region North Sea===

The North Sea naval region was the first to be established and was originally known as ''Der kommandierende Admiral der Marinestation der Nordsee''.  The command was formed from a preexisting unit of the Reichsmarine, known as the [[Marinestation der Nordsee]].  In the spring of 1943, the title was renamed as the ''Marineoberkommando der Nordsee''.  Major subordinate districts were the ''Deutsches Marinekommando Italien'' (this command eventually became Naval Region South) and the ''Admiral in den Niederlanden'' which oversaw all German naval matters in the occupied [[Netherlands]].

The following officers held the title of regional commander during the years of Naval region North Sea's existence.

* [[Admiral (Germany)|Admiral]] [[Otto Schultze]]: Jul 1935 - Oct 1937
* Admiral [[Hermann Boehm (admiral)|Hermann Boehm]]: Oct 1937 - Oct 1938 
* Admiral [[Alfred Saalwächter]]: Oct 1938 - Aug 1939
* Admiral [[Otto Schultze]]: Aug - Nov 1939 
* Vice admiral [[Hermann Densch]]: Nov 1939 - Mar 1943
* Admiral [[Erich Förste]]: Mar 1943 - May 1945

Major port cities under the control of Naval Region North Sea were [[Wilhelmshaven]], [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]].  The regional command was also the authority for all [[United States Naval Observatory|naval observatories]] in the area.  A central administrative office, known as the ''Heimatverwaltung West'' coordinated all shore activities while the ''Heimatverwaltung Ausland'' oversaw region personnel deployed to other areas of the Kriegsmarine.  The ''Troßschiffverband Nord'' was the department responsbile for the maintenance and upkeep of all [[troopship|troop ship]]s on call for deployment into the [[North Sea]].

===Naval Region Baltic Sea===

The German Navy had maintained a presence in the [[Baltic Sea]] since the 19th century, and in 1865 the earliest continuous command in the area, the [[Marinestation der Ostsee]], was establsihed in Kiel.  By June 1935, the reichsmarine had established a position known as ''Der Chef der Marinestation der Ostsee''.  In November 1938, the Kriegsmarine created the post of ''Der Kommandierende General der Marinestation der Ostsee'', also headquartered at [[Kiel]].  The region was commanded by a full admiral (or [[general admiral]]) with a deputy known as the ''2. Admiral der Ostseestation''. 

Subordinated to the Baltic Sea regional commander were three &quot;coastal commanders&quot; (''Küstenbefehlshaber'') who oversaw various harbor and coastal defense units.  The port superintendent of Kiel (''Marineintendantur Kiel'') also reported directly to the regional command as well as several inspection units for naval weapons, artillery, torpedoes, and well as an Inspector for Training and Education (''Inspektion des Bildungswesens der Marine'').  The naval region also contained a signals unit, medical department, and personnel branch.  The commander of U-boats was originally administratrively subordinated to the Baltic regional commander, but became an independent separate command after 1938.

In mid 1942, the name of the command was shortened to ''Kommando der Marinestation der Ostsee'' and in 1943 adopted its final name as ''Marineoberkommando Ostsee''.  The two primary subordinate naval districts were the ''Admiral Dänemark'' (controlling all shore based German naval forces in [[Denmark]]) and the ''Admiral Ostland'' which controlled naval shore forces east of Kiel, including those stationed in [[Poland]].

The following Kriegsmarine officers held the position as Baltic Sea regional commander:

* Admiral [[Conrad Albrecht]]: Jul 1935 - Nov 1938
* Admiral [[Rolf Carls]]: Nov 1938 - Jan 1940
* Admiral [[Günther Guse]]: Jan 1940 - Mar 1943
* Admiral [[Hubert Schmundt]]: Mar 1943 - Mar 1944
* General admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]]: Mar 1944 - May 1945

===Naval Region South===

German Navy shore activities in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] were originally overseen by an office, known as the ''Chef des Deutschen Marineverbindungsstabes'', headed by Rear admiral [[Eberhard Weichold]] and established in June 1940.  The following year, the office adopted the lengthy title ''Deutscher Admiral beim Admiralstab der königlich italienischen Marine''.  In November 1941, the office was redesignated as the ''Befehlshaber des Deutschen Marinekommandos Italien''.  In March 1943, the command was assumed by Rear admiral [[Wilhelm Meendsen-Bohlken]].  Meedsen-Bohlken was briefly replaced by Vice admiral [[Friedrich Ruge]], in May 1943, before Meedsen-Bohlken returned to the same post that August.  In July 1944, command was assumed by Vice admiral [[Werner Löwisch]].  In January 1945 the Italian naval shore command was renamed as the ''Oberbefehlshaber Marineoberkommando Süd''.

===Naval Region Norway===

The final Navy regional command established during the Second World War was the ''Marineoberkommando in Norwegen'', established in late 1943 to deal specifically with German naval forces in [[Norway]].  Admiral [[Otto Ciliax]] served as regional commander until the last month of the war when he was replaced by Admiral [[Theodor Krancke]]. 

The headquarters of the Norwegian naval region was at [[Oslo]] where was maintained a headquarters staff, signals company, and war correspondence unit.  A naval weapons office, known as the ''Torpedoarsenal Norwegen'' oversaw all logistics for naval arms, in particular submarine [[torpedoes]], for Kriegsmarine units stationed in Norway.  The region also operationally controlled a [[blockade]] runner group known as ''Netzsperrgruppe Nord''.  In addition to regular naval shore commands,the Norwegian Naval Region also hosted four naval construction brigades (''Bauaufsicht der Kriegsmarine'') which were stationed in [[Horten]], [[Bergen]], [[Trondheim]], and [[Tromsø]]

==Naval districts==

Naval districts were the direct operational forces for all shore units of the Kriegsmarine and were assigned coastal areas of responsibility as well as operational command of any permanently assigned submarine or ship flotillas (although administratively, these units were under the various [[Organization_of_the_Kriegsmarine#Navy_Type_Commands|type commanders]].  Most naval regions also maintained a staff headquarters unit, signals unit, war correspondence company, as well as a regional medical clinic.

Navy districts were operationally subordinated to Navy group commanders and were organized by either geographical region or country of occupation.  The &quot;Admiral Deutsche Bucht&quot; was headquartered in [[Wilhelmshaven]] and commanded German ports along the North Sea.  The &quot;Admiral z.b.V. Südost&quot; was in command of inland waterways, river units, and was headquartered at [[Traunstein]].

===France and the Low Countries===

After the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupation of France]] and the [[Low Countries]], the German Navy established a single regional command for these areas which was known as &quot;Admiral West&quot;.  The command was first stood up in May 1940, while the [[Battle of France]] was still ongoing, with its first commander Admiral [[Karlgeorg Schuster]].  In June 1940, following the surrender of France, the command's name changed to ''Kommandierenden Admiral Frankreich'' and was headquartered in Paris.  In May 1941, command as &quot;Admiral Frannkreich&quot; was passed to [[Otto Schultze]].  In August 1942, the final commander, [[Wilhelm Marschall]] was appointed and would hold the command until that November.  At that time the naval region of France was broken up into smaller areas as a result of [[Case Anton]] when Germany occupied the entirety of France.

The three late war naval districts of France were:

* Admiral Atlantikküste (Western [[France]])
* Admiral Kanalküste ([[English Channel]]) 
* Admiral Französischen Südküste (Southern France)	

[[Friedrich Rieve]] commanded the English channel district during the [[Invasion of Normandy]] while [[Ernst Scheurlen]] commanded southern France during [[Operation Dragoon]].  In both these cases, the commands were disbanded shortly thereafter due to an overun of the districts by Allied forces.  The &quot;Atlantic Coast&quot; command, overseeing the majority of naval forces in western France, remained active until early 1945 under its final commander, Admiral [[Johannes Bachmann]].

German port facilities in [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied Belgium]] were never formed into an independent command and were subordinated to other regions and naval districts.  Naval shore authority in the [[Netherlands]] was originally a subordinate officer to Admiral West and was known as the ''Marinebefehlshaber in den Niederlanden''.  The original commander was [[Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière]] who briefly held the post for a one month in May 1940 before command was assumed by [[Helmuth Kienast]].  In June 1943, the post was past to ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Kurt Caesar Hoffmann]] who was in turn relieved by [[Gustav Kleikamp]] in March 1943.  the following month, the Netherlands district became an independent command known as the ''Kommandiernder Admiral in den Niederlanden''.  The final command of the district was Vice admiral [[Rudolf Stange]] who held command in January 1945 until the Germans evacuated the country in the face of advancing Allied forces.

===Denmark and Norway===

When German [[Denmark in World War II|occupied Denmark]] in April 1940, the Kriegsmarine established a naval command for the entire country known as the ''Marinebefehlshaber Dänemark''.  The command was first held by Admiral [[Raul Mewis]] and maintained two subordinate naval districts known as the ''Abschnitt Nordjütland'' and the ''Abschnitt Südjütland und dänische Inseln''.  In March 1943 the name of the command was changed to the ''Kommandierender Admiral Dänemark'', frequently shortened to simply &quot;Admiral Dänemark&quot;.  The command was then assumed by Vice admiral [[Hans-Heinrich Wurmbach]] who held the post until the end of World Aar II.  In April 1944, after Germany had placed all of [[Denmark]] under military occupation the previous fall, the command name was again changed to ''Kommandierender Admiral Skagerak''.&lt;ref&gt;Lampe, D., Hitler's Savage Canary: A History of the Danish Resistance in World War II, PWxyz, LLC (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval areas==

In larger Naval regions, an intermediary command between the regions and local forces was the &quot;Navy Area&quot; (''Marine-Abschnitt'') of which the Kriegsmarine established seventeen such areas during the Second World War.  In occupied territories, as well as some major German ports, these areas were known as ''Kriegsmarinedienststellen'' (Navy War Service Areas) with fourteen established between 1941 and 1945.  Navy areas were typically commanded by a senior naval officer, most often a ''Kapitän zur See'' or ''Korvettenkapitän'', who was known as ''Der Kommandant im Abschnitt''.

A special naval area was also established for the city of Paris and was known as the ''Höheres Kommando der Marinedienststellen in Groß-Paris'' (Supreme Command for Naval Services in the Greater Paris Area).  The command contained a headquarters staff, several transport units, a signals and communications division, legal office, and medical staff.  [[Werner Lindenau]] served as naval commander of Paris from June 1943 until the Germans evacuated the city the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Rosbottom, R.

===Sea defense zones===

{{main|Sea defense zone}}

Sea defense zones were tactical naval areas, along the coastline of occupied Europe, intended to provide an operational command chain in the event of an actual enemy attack.  The zones were commanded by an officer normally ranked as either ''Kapitän zur See'' or ''Konteradmiral''.  The sea defense zone commander (''Kommandant der Seeverteidigung'') answered to the Navy regional commanders and would take tactical control over all shore forces in a given area should an enemy launch an actual attack against a segment of German coastline.

In practice, the sea defense zones became well tested when the Allies invaded western Europe, in particular at the [[battle of Normandy]].  Sea Defense zone forces also fought fiercely to avoid losing Germany's submarine bases in France, in [[Allied siege of La Rochelle|one case]] holding out for several months under Allied siege before surrendering.

'''Castle Toward''' ({{lang-gd|Caisteal an Toll Àird}}) is a  nineteenth-century [[country house]] on the southern tip of the [[Cowal]] Peninsula, overlooking [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothesay]] Bay in [[Argyll and Bute]], on the West coast of [[Scotland]]. Built in 1820 it replaced a late medieval castle (ruin), formerly the ancestral home of the [[Clan Lamont]]. In the Second World War it served as HMS ''Brontosaurus'', and after the war, it was sold to [[Glasgow Corporation]]. It was used as an [[outdoor education]] facility until closure in 2009. The castle and estate are now again privately owned by [[Denice Purdie]] and [[Keith Punler]] since 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/14898328.Castle_at_centre_of_community_buyout_controversy_is_sold_to_developer_for_just___1_5m/ |title=Castle at centre of community buyout controversy is sold to developer for just £1.5m (From The National) |publisher=Thenational.scot |date=2015-06-27 |accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Toward Castle===
The original Toward Castle dates from the 15th century, and was owned by the [[Clan Lamont]] until 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.darkisle.com/t/toward/toward.html| title=Toward Castle| publisher=Dark Isle| accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was extended in the 17th century, but was abandoned after an attack by the [[Clan Campbell]] in 1646.&lt;ref name=&quot;historic-scotland2400&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2400:15:0::::GARDEN:GDL00097 |title=Toward Castle, Historic Scotland Gardens}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins lie around {{convert|500|m}} south-east of the later building. 

[[File:Old Castle Toward.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of Toward Castle]]

===Castle Toward===
The present Castle Toward was built in 1820 by [[Kirkman Finlay]], former [[Lord Provost of Glasgow]], as his family's country house. Finlay purchased the Achavoulin estate and renamed in Toward in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING,HL:5068 |title=Castle Toward, Historic Scotland listing}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built in the castellated [[Gothic Revival]] style, and designed by [[David Hamilton (architect)|David Hamilton]]. [[Edward La Trobe Bateman]] was involved in garden design work here in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;historic-scotland2400&quot;/&gt;

It was from Castle Toward that the second son of Alexander Struthers Finlay - Alexander Kirkman Finlay - emigrated to the then colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia, and subsequently married the daughter of the then [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead]]. The [[wedding of Nora Robinson and Alexander Kirkman Finlay]] at [[St James' Church, Sydney]] in 1878 attracted enormous attention in the colony and was extensively reported in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13414065 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=NSW |date=8 August 1878 |accessdate=10 November 2013 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T&amp;C1708&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70594065 |title=Mr. and Mrs. Finlay |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |location=NSW |date=17 August 1878 |accessdate=10 November 2013 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Kirkman Finlay returned to Castle Toward and died there in 1883, five years after his marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Probate Calendar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later owned and extended by Major Andrew Coats, of the Coats family of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], Italian plasterwork was installed in the public rooms in 1920. The entire building was restored and enlarged over the course of the 1920s by the architect [[Francis William Deas]], who also laid out most of the current landscaping. The grounds incorporate the ruins of the original Toward Castle, the Chinese ponds, wooded areas, access to the shore, and views over the [[Firth of Clyde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historic-scotland2400&quot;/&gt;

===HMS ''Brontosaurus''===

During the Second World War the castle was requisitioned as a [[combined operations]] centre (COC No. 2), and was commissioned as HMS ''Brontosaurus'' in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.combinedops.com/TRAINING_TOWARD.htm| title=Combined Training Centre - Castle Toward| accessdate = 2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a training centre for the amphibious landings which were launched on [[D-Day]] as well as other raids. Officers and men were trained in use of various landing craft on nearby beaches. ''Brontosaurus'' was visited by both [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Lord Mountbatten]] during this time. It closed in 1946.

===Outdoor education centre===

The castle, and {{convert|226|acre|km2}} of woodland, were purchased by the [[Glasgow|Corporation of Glasgow]] in 1948. The building was used initially as a residential school for children recovering from illness or living in deprived home conditions. It then became available for residential education for children from all Glasgow Primary Schools and operated for 50 years as an outdoor education centre for children from Glasgow and [[Renfrewshire]].&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dunoon-observer.com/archive/arcoct200010.html| title=Castle Toward Sell Off| work=Dunoon Observer| date=10 October 2003|accessdate = 2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the reorganisation of local government in Scotland in 1996, ownership passed to [[Argyll and Bute|Argyll and Bute Council]] and such centres were threatened with closure. Peter Wilson, at the time the principal of the centre, formed a company called Actual Reality to operate the centre, as well as a second council-owned centre at [[Ardentinny]].&lt;ref name=observer/&gt; Activities operated by Actual Reality included high ropes, kayaking, and orienteering, as well as gorge walks and hill walks. The grounds of the centre were used as a filming location for the children's [[BBC Television]] series ''[[Raven (game show)|Raven]]'', featuring the actor [[James Mackenzie (actor)|James Mackenzie]], up to and including the seventh series at the start of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197596/| title= Raven (2002– ) | publisher=IMDB | accessdate=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house was also used for residential courses for young people in music and art. The [[Glasgow Schools' Symphony Orchestra]] and [[West of Scotland Schools' Concert Band]] visited regularly.

==Sale==

On 13 November 2009 Argyll and Bute Council temporarily closed the castle on the recommendation of [[Strathclyde Fire and Rescue]], on the grounds that it was unfit for purpose.&lt;ref name=observer2009/&gt; There have since been several attempts by the council to sell the estate, but all have met with fierce local opposition.&lt;ref name=observer2009&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dunoon-observer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26:castle-toward-selloff-threat&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=19| title=Castle Toward Sell Off Threat| work=Dunoon Observer| date=30 December 2009|accessdate = 2015-01-27}}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle's former composer-in-residence, [[John Maxwell Geddes]], wrote a ''Postlude for Strings'' in protest at plans to sell the castle.&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/mobile/lifestyle/heritage/5-600-sign-petition-to-save-argyll-s-castle-toward-1-3670908 |title=5,600 sign petition to save Argyll’s Castle Toward |work=The Scotsman |date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council placed the building on the market in 2010, and in response the South Cowal Community Development Company (SCCDC) was formed to explore [[community ownership]] of the castle, though their initial bid was rejected by the [[Scottish Ministers]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dunoon-observer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3023:community-bid-rejected&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=19| title=Community Bid Rejected| work=Dunoon Observer| date=16 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached with a holiday company, which then pulled out of the sale in 2013 forcing the Council to market the property once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dunoon-observer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6182:castle-toward-for-sale-again&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=19| title=Castle Toward For Sale - Again| work=Dunoon Observer| date=29 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCCDC launched a second community ownership bid which was accepted by Scottish Ministers in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dunoon-observer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6827:castle-toward-community-purchase-a-step-closer&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=19| title=Castle Toward - Community Purchase One Step Closer| work=Dunoon Observer| date=27 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2014 the Council rejected SCCDC's offer, claiming that at £865,000 it was below market value, and instead offered to support SCCDC with a loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.argyll-bute.gov.uk/news/2014/dec/castle-toward |title=Castle Toward|work=Argyll and Bute Council | date= 22 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCCDC dismissed the Council's proposal in January 2015, stating that securing the community purchase before a 31 January deadline now had &quot;very little chance of succeeding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savecastletoward.com/#!NO-to-%C2%A31-Million-pound-loan/c1zo4/54c0d2170cf2ad5dc6c3e545 |title=&quot;NO&quot; to £1 Million pound loan |work=SCCDC |date=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 26 January, 5,600 people had signed an online petition calling on the Council to reconsider their decision.&lt;ref name=Scotsman/&gt; The council sold the castle in 2016, for £1.75M, to Denice Purdie and Keith Punler&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buteman.co.uk/news/business/bute-councillor-s-relief-at-castle-toward-sale-1-3821978 Bute councillor’s relief at Castle Toward sale - The Buteman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1132">A '''sea defense zone''' was a tactical area in the [[organization of the Kriegsmarine]] intended to provide operational command of all German naval forces, within a given geographical area, in the event of actual enemy attack on the coastline of [[German-occupied Europe|occupied Europe]].

Sea defense zones were normally commanded by an officer ranked as either [[Kapitän zur See]] or [[Konteradmiral]]. The sea defense zone commander (''Kommandant der Seeverteidigung'') answered to the Navy [[Naval_regions_and_districts_of_the_Kriegsmarine#Naval_regions|regional commanders]] and would take tactical control over all shore forces in a given area should an enemy launch an actual attack against a segment of German coastline.

The sea defense zones were strictly a Navy command, but integrated as well into the [[Atlantic Wall]] which was generally overseen by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]].
